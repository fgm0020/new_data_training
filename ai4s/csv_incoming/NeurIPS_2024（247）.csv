Poster,Matching the Statistical Query Lower Bound for $k$-Sparse Parity Problems with Sign Stochastic Gradient Descent,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96024,"Yiwen Kou, Zixiang Chen, Quanquan Gu, Sham Kakade","The $k$-sparse parity problem is a classical problem in computational complexity and algorithmic theory, serving as a key benchmark for understanding computational classes. In this paper, we solve the $k$-sparse parity problem with sign stochastic gradient descent, a variant of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on two-layer fully-connected neural networks. We demonstrate that this approach can efficiently solve the $k$-sparse parity problem on a $d$-dimensional hypercube ($k\le O(\sqrt{d})$) with a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(d^{k-1})$ using $2^{\Theta(k)}$ neurons, matching the established $\Omega(d^{k})$ lower bounds of Statistical Query (SQ) models. Our theoretical analysis begins by constructing a good neural network capable of correctly solving the $k$-parity problem. We then demonstrate how a trained neural network with sign SGD can effectively approximate this good network, solving the $k$-parity problem with small statistical errors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that matches the SQ lower bound for solving $k$-sparse parity problem using gradient-based methods."
Poster,MATES: Model-Aware Data Selection for Efficient Pretraining with Data Influence Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96504,"Zichun Yu, Spandan Das, Chenyan Xiong","Pretraining data selection has the potential to improve language model pretraining efficiency by utilizing higher-quality data from massive web data corpora. Current data selection methods, which rely on either hand-crafted rules or larger reference models, are conducted statically and do not capture the evolving data preferences during pretraining. In this paper, we introduce *model-aware data selection with data influence models (MATES)*, where a data influence model continuously adapts to the evolving data preferences of the pretraining model and then selects the data most effective for the current pretraining progress. Specifically, we collect oracle data influence by locally probing the pretraining model and fine-tune a small data influence model to approximate it accurately. The data influence model then predicts data influence over the whole pretraining corpus and selects the most influential data for the next pretraining stage. Experiments of pretraining 410M and 1B models on the C4 dataset demonstrate that MATES significantly outperforms random data selection on extensive downstream tasks. It doubles the gains achieved by the state-of-the-art data selection approach that leverages larger reference models and reduces the total FLOPs required to reach certain performances by half. Further analyses validate the effectiveness of the locally probed oracle data influence and the approximation with data influence models.

Poster,MatFormer: Nested Transformer for Elastic Inference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94199,"Fnu Devvrit, Sneha Kudugunta, Aditya Kusupati, Tim Dettmers, Kaifeng Chen, Inderjit Dhillon, Yulia Tsvetkov, Hanna Hajishirzi, Sham Kakade, Ali Farhadi, Prateek Jain","Foundation models are applied in a broad spectrum of settings with different inference constraints, from massive multi-accelerator clusters to resource-constrained standalone mobile devices. However, the substantial costs associated with training these models often limit the number of unique model sizes that can be offered. Consequently, practitioners are compelled to select a model that may not be optimally aligned with their specific latency and cost requirements. We present MatFormer, a novel Transformer architecture designed to provide elastic inference across diverse deployment constraints. MatFormer achieves this by incorporating a nested Feed Forward Network (FFN) block structure within a standard Transformer model. During training, we  optimize the parameters of multiple nested FFN blocks with varying sizes, enabling the extraction of hundreds of accurate smaller models without incurring additional computational costs. We empirically validate the efficacy of MatFormer across different model classes (decoders and encoders) and modalities (language and vision), demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment. We show that a 850M decoder-only MatFormer language model (MatLM) allows us to extract multiple smaller models spanning from 582M to 850M parameters, each exhibiting better validation loss and one-shot downstream evaluations than independently trained counterparts. Furthermore, we observe that smaller encoders extracted from a universal MatFormer-based ViT (MatViT) encoder preserve the metric-space structure for adaptive large-scale retrieval. Finally, we showcase that speculative decoding with the accurate and consistent submodels extracted from  MatFormer can lead to significant reduction in inference latency."
Poster,MathPile: A Billion-Token-Scale Pretraining Corpus for Math,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97685,"Zengzhi Wang, Xuefeng Li, Rui Xia, Pengfei Liu","High-quality, large-scale corpora are the cornerstone of building foundation models. In this work, we introduce MathPile, a diverse and high-quality math-centric corpus comprising about 9.5 billion tokens. Throughout its creation, we adhered to the principle of “less is more”, firmly believing in the supremacy of data quality over quantity, even in the pre-training phase. Our meticulous data collection and processing efforts included a complex suite of preprocessing, prefiltering, language identification, cleaning, filtering, and deduplication, ensuring the high quality of our corpus. Furthermore, we performed data contamination detection on downstream benchmark test sets to eliminate duplicates and conducted continual pre-training experiments, booting the performance on common mathematical reasoning benchmarks. We aim for our MathPile to boost language models’ mathematical reasoning abilities and open-source its different versions and processing scripts to advance the field."
Poster,Matrix Denoising with Doubly Heteroscedastic Noise: Fundamental Limits and Optimal Spectral Methods,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95423,"Yihan Zhang, Marco Mondelli","We study the matrix denoising problem of estimating the singular vectors of a rank-$1$ signal corrupted by noise with both column and row correlations. Existing works are either unable to pinpoint the exact asymptotic estimation error or, when they do so, the resulting approaches (e.g., based on whitening or singular value shrinkage) remain vastly suboptimal. On top of this, most of the literature has focused on the special case of estimating the left singular vector of the signal when the noise only possesses row correlation (one-sided heteroscedasticity). In contrast, our work establishes the information-theoretic and algorithmic limits of matrix denoising with doubly heteroscedastic noise. We characterize the exact asymptotic minimum mean square error, and design a novel spectral estimator with rigorous optimality guarantees: under a technical condition, it attains positive correlation with the signals whenever information-theoretically possible and, for one-sided heteroscedasticity, it also achieves the Bayes-optimal error. Numerical experiments demonstrate the significant advantage of our theoretically principled method with the state of the art. The proofs draw connections with statistical physics and approximate message passing, departing drastically from standard random matrix theory techniques."
Poster,MatrixNet: Learning over symmetry groups using learned group representations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94510,"Lucas Laird, Circe Hsu, Asilata Bapat, Robin Walters","Group theory has been used in machine learning to provide a theoretically grounded approach for incorporating known symmetry transformations in tasks from robotics to protein modeling. In these applications, equivariant neural networks use knownsymmetry groups with predefined representations to learn over geometric input data. We propose MatrixNet, a neural network architecture that learns matrix representations of group element inputs instead of using predefined representations. MatrixNet achieves higher sample efficiency and generalization over several standard baselines in prediction tasks over the several finite groups and the Artin braid group. We also show that MatrixNet respects group relations allowing generalization to group elements of greater word length than in the training set. Our code is available at https://github.com/lucas-laird/MatrixNet."
Poster,Matryoshka Query Transformer for Large Vision-Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96220,"Wenbo Hu, Zi-Yi Dou, Liunian Li, Amita Kamath, Nanyun Peng, Kai-Wei Chang","Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) typically encode an image into a fixed number of visual tokens (e.g., 576) and process these tokens with a language model. Despite their strong performance, LVLMs face challenges in adapting to varying computational constraints. This raises the question: can we achieve flexibility in the number of visual tokens to suit different tasks and computational resources? We answer this with an emphatic yes. Inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, we introduce the Matryoshka Query Transformer (MQT), capable of encoding an image into $m$ visual tokens during inference, where $m$ can be any number up to a predefined maximum. This is achieved by employing a query transformer with $M$ latent query tokens to compress the visual embeddings. During each training step, we randomly select $m \leq M$ latent query tokens and train the model using only these first $m$ tokens, discarding the rest.Combining MQT with LLaVA, we train a single model once, and flexibly and drastically reduce the number of inference-time visual tokens while maintaining similar or better performance compared to training independent models for each number of tokens. Our model, MQT-LLaVA, matches LLaVA-1.5 performance across 11 benchmarks using a maximum of 256 tokens instead of LLaVA’s fixed 576. Reducing to 16 tokens (8x less TFLOPs) only sacrifices the performance by 2.4 points on MMBench. On certain tasks such as ScienceQA and MMMU, we can even go down to only 2 visual tokens with performance drops of just 3\% and 6\% each.Our exploration of the trade-off between the accuracy and computational cost brought about by the number of visual tokens facilitates future research to achieve the best of both worlds."
Poster,MaVEn: An Effective Multi-granularity Hybrid Visual Encoding Framework for Multimodal Large Language Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94216,"Chaoya Jiang, Hongrui Jia, Haiyang Xu, Wei Ye, Mengfan Dong, Ming Yan, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang, Shikun Zhang","This paper presents MaVEn, an innovative Multi-granularity Visual Encoding framework designed to enhance the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in multi-image reasoning. Current MLLMs primarily focus on single-image visual understanding, limiting their ability to interpret and integrate information across multiple images. MaVEn addresses this limitation by combining discrete visual symbol sequences, which abstract coarse-grained semantic concepts, with traditional continuous representation sequences that model fine-grained features. This dual approach bridges the semantic gap between visual and textual data, thereby improving the model's ability to process and interpret information from multiple images effectively. Additionally, we design a dynamic reduction mechanism by for long-sequence continuous features to enhance multi-image processing efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that MaVEn significantly enhances MLLMs' understanding in complex multi-image scenarios, while also improving performance in single-image contexts."
Poster,Maximizing utility in multi-agent environments by anticipating the behavior of other learners,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96898,"Angelos Assos, Yuval Dagan, Constantinos Daskalakis","Learning algorithms are often used to make decisions in sequential decision-making environments. In multi-agent settings, the decisions of each agent can affect the utilities/losses of the other agents. Therefore, if an agent is good at anticipating the behavior of the other agents, in particular how they will make decisions in each round as a function of their experience that far, it could try to judiciously make its own decisions over the rounds of the interaction so as to influence the other agents to behave in a way that ultimately benefits its own utility. In this paper, we study repeated two-player games involving two types of agents: a learner, which employs an online learning algorithm to choose its strategy in each round; and an optimizer, which knows the learner's utility function and the learner's online learning algorithm. The optimizer wants to plan ahead to maximize its own utility, while taking into account the learner's behavior. We provide two results: a positive result for repeated zero-sum games and a negative result for repeated general-sum games. Our positive result is an algorithm for the optimizer, which exactly maximizes its utility against a learner that plays the Replicator Dynamics --- the continuous-time analogue of Multiplicative Weights Update (MWU). Additionally, we use this result to provide an algorithm for the optimizer against MWU, i.e.~for the discrete-time setting, which guarantees an average utility for the optimizer that is higher than the value of the one-shot game. Our negative result shows that, unless P=NP, there is no Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) for maximizing the utility of an optimizer against a learner that best-responds to the history in each round. Yet, this still leaves open the question of whether there exists a polynomial-time algorithm that optimizes the utility up to $o(T)$."
Poster,Maximum Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning of Diffusion Models with Energy-Based Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94930,"Sangwoong Yoon, Himchan Hwang, Dohyun Kwon, Yung-Kyun Noh, Frank Park","We present a maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) approach for improving the sample quality of diffusion generative models, especially when the number of generation time steps is small. Similar to how IRL trains a policy based on the reward function learned from expert demonstrations, we train (or fine-tune) a diffusion model using the log probability density estimated from training data. Since we employ an energy-based model (EBM) to represent the log density, our approach boils down to the joint training of a diffusion model and an EBM. Our IRL formulation, named Diffusion by Maximum Entropy IRL (DxMI), is a minimax problem that reaches equilibrium when both models converge to the data distribution. The entropy maximization plays a key role in DxMI, facilitating the exploration of the diffusion model and ensuring the convergence of the EBM. We also propose Diffusion by Dynamic Programming (DxDP), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm for diffusion models, as a subroutine in DxMI. DxDP makes the diffusion model update in DxMI efficient by transforming the original problem into an optimal control formulation where value functions replace back-propagation in time. Our empirical studies show that diffusion models fine-tuned using DxMI can generate high-quality samples in as few as 4 and 10 steps.  Additionally, DxMI enables the training of an EBM without MCMC, stabilizing EBM training dynamics and enhancing anomaly detection performance."
