Poster,DiReCT: Diagnostic Reasoning for Clinical Notes via Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97782,"Bowen Wang, Jiuyang Chang, Yiming Qian, Guoxin Chen, Junhao Chen, Zhouqiang Jiang, Jiahao Zhang, Yuta Nakashima, Hajime Nagahara","Large language models (LLMs) have recently showcased remarkable capabilities, spanning a wide range of tasks and applications, including those in the medical domain. Models like GPT-4 excel in medical question answering but may face challenges in the lack of interpretability when handling complex tasks in real clinical settings. We thus introduce the diagnostic reasoning dataset for clinical notes (DiReCT), aiming at evaluating the reasoning ability and interpretability of LLMs compared to human doctors. It contains 511 clinical notes, each meticulously annotated by physicians, detailing the diagnostic reasoning process from observations in a clinical note to the final diagnosis. Additionally, a diagnostic knowledge graph is provided to offer essential knowledge for reasoning, which may not be covered in the training data of existing LLMs. Evaluations of leading LLMs on DiReCT bring out a significant gap between their reasoning ability and that of human doctors, highlighting the critical need for models that can reason effectively in real-world clinical scenarios."
Poster,Directional Smoothness and Gradient Methods: Convergence and Adaptivity,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93771,"Aaron Mishkin, Ahmed Khaled, Yuanhao Wang, Aaron Defazio, Robert Gower","We develop new sub-optimality bounds for gradient descent (GD) that depend on the conditioning of the objective along the path of optimization, rather than on global, worst-case constants.  Key to our proofs is directional smoothness, a measure of gradient variation that we use to develop upper-bounds on the objective.  Minimizing these upper-bounds requires solving implicit equations to obtain a sequence of strongly adapted step-sizes; we show that these equations are straightforward to solve for convex quadratics and lead to new guarantees for two classical step-sizes.  For general functions, we prove that the Polyak step-size and normalized GD obtain fast, path-dependent rates despite using no knowledge of the directional smoothness.  Experiments on logistic regression show our convergence guarantees are tighter than the classical theory based on $L$-smoothness."
Poster,Director3D: Real-world Camera Trajectory and 3D Scene Generation from Text,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96951,"Xinyang Li, Zhangyu Lai, Linning Xu, Yansong Qu, Liujuan Cao, ShengChuan Zhang, Bo Dai, Rongrong Ji","Recent advancements in 3D generation have leveraged synthetic datasets with ground truth 3D assets and predefined camera trajectories. However, the potential of adopting real-world datasets, which can produce significantly more realistic 3D scenes, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we delve into the key challenge of the complex and scene-specific camera trajectories found in real-world captures. We introduce Director3D, a robust open-world text-to-3D generation framework, designed to generate both real-world 3D scenes and adaptive camera trajectories. To achieve this, (1) we first utilize a Trajectory Diffusion Transformer, acting as the \emph{Cinematographer}, to model the distribution of camera trajectories based on textual descriptions. Next, a Gaussian-driven Multi-view Latent Diffusion Model serves as the \emph{Decorator}, modeling the image sequence distribution given the camera trajectories and texts. This model, fine-tuned from a 2D diffusion model, directly generates pixel-aligned 3D Gaussians as an immediate 3D scene representation for consistent denoising. Lastly, the 3D Gaussians are further refined by a novel SDS++ loss as the \emph{Detailer}, which incorporates the prior of the 2D diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Director3D outperforms existing methods, offering superior performance in real-world 3D generation."
Poster,Direct Preference-Based Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimization with Dueling Bandits,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93593,"Tian Huang, Shengbo Wang, Ke Li","The ultimate goal of multi-objective optimization (MO) is to assist human decision-makers (DMs) in identifying solutions of interest (SOI) that optimally reconcile multiple objectives according to their preferences. Preference-based evolutionary MO (PBEMO) has emerged as a promising framework that progressively approximates SOI by involving human in the optimization-cum-decision-making process. Yet, current PBEMO approaches are prone to be inefficient and misaligned with the DM’s true aspirations, especially when inadvertently exploiting mis-calibrated reward models. This is further exacerbated when considering the stochastic nature of human feedback. This paper proposes a novel framework that navigates MO to SOI by directly leveraging human feedback without being restricted by a predefined reward model nor cumbersome model selection. Specifically, we developed a clustering-based stochastic dueling bandits algorithm that strategically scales well to high-dimensional dueling bandits, and achieves a regret of $\mathcal{O}(K^2\log T)$, where $K$ is the number of clusters and $T$ is the number of rounds. The learned preferences are then transformed into a unified probabilistic format that can be readily adapted to prevalent EMO algorithms. This also leads to a principled termination criterion that strategically manages human cognitive loads and computational budget. Experiments on $48$ benchmark test problems, including synthetic problems, RNA inverse design and protein structure prediction, fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach."
Poster,Direct Unlearning Optimization for Robust and Safe Text-to-Image Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94956,"Yong-Hyun Park, Sangdoo Yun, Jin-Hwa Kim, Junho Kim, Geonhui Jang, Yonghyun Jeong, Junghyo Jo, Gayoung Lee","Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models have greatly benefited from large-scale datasets, but they also pose significant risks due to the potential generation of unsafe content. To mitigate this issue, researchers proposed unlearning techniques that attempt to induce the model to unlearn potentially harmful prompts. However, these methods are easily bypassed by adversarial attacks, making them unreliable for ensuring the safety of generated images. In this paper, we propose Direct Unlearning Optimization (DUO), a novel framework for removing NSFW content from T2I models while preserving their performance on unrelated topics. DUO employs a preference optimization approach using curated paired image data, ensuring that the model learns to remove unsafe visual concepts while retain unrelated features. Furthermore, we introduce an output-preserving regularization term to maintain the model's generative capabilities on safe content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DUO can robustly defend against various state-of-the-art red teaming methods without significant performance degradation on unrelated topics, as measured by FID and CLIP scores. Our work contributes to the development of safer and more reliable T2I models, paving the way for their responsible deployment in both closed-source and open-source scenarios."
Poster,DisCEdit: Model Editing by Identifying Discriminative Components,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93306,"Chaitanya Murti, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya","Model editing is a growing area of research that is particularly valuable in contexts where modifying key model components, like neurons or filters, can significantly impact the model’s performance. The key challenge lies in identifying important components useful to the model’s predictions. We apply model editing to address two active areas of research, Structured Pruning, and Selective Class Forgetting. In this work, we adopt a distributional approach to the problem of identifying important components, leveraging the recently proposed discriminative filters hypothesis, which states that well-trained (convolutional) models possess discriminative filters that are essential to prediction. To do so, we define discriminative ability in terms of the Bayes error rate associated with the feature distributions, which is equivalent to computing the Total Variation (TV) distance between the distributions. However, computing the TV distance is intractable, motivating us to derive novel witness function-based lower bounds on the TV distance that require no assumptions on the underlying distributions; using this bound generalizes prior work such as Murti et al. [39] that relied on unrealistic Gaussianity assumptions on the feature distributions. With these bounds, we are able to discover critical subnetworks responsible for classwise predictions, and derive DISCEDIT-SP and DISCEDIT-U , algorithms for structured pruning requiring no access to the training data and loss function, and selective forgetting respectively. We apply DISCEDIT-U to selective class forgetting on models trained on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, and we show that on average, we can reduce accuracy on a single class by over 80% with a minimal reduction in test accuracy on the remaining classes. Similarly, on Structured pruning problems, we obtain 40.8% sparsity on ResNet50 on Imagenet, with only a 2.6% drop in accuracy with minimal fine-tuning."
Poster,DisC-GS: Discontinuity-aware Gaussian Splatting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95092,"Haoxuan Qu, Zhuoling Li, Hossein Rahmani, Yujun Cai, Jun Liu","Recently, Gaussian Splatting, a method that represents a 3D scene as a collection of Gaussian distributions, has gained significant attention in addressing the task of novel view synthesis. In this paper, we highlight a fundamental limitation of Gaussian Splatting: its inability to accurately render discontinuities and boundaries in images due to the continuous nature of Gaussian distributions. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework enabling Gaussian Splatting to perform discontinuity-aware image rendering. Additionally, we introduce a B\'ezier-boundary gradient approximation strategy within our framework to keep the ``differentiability'' of the proposed discontinuity-aware rendering process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our framework."
Poster,Discovering Creative Behaviors through DUPLEX: Diverse Universal Features for Policy Exploration,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94499,"Borja G. Leon, Francesco Riccio, Kaushik Subramanian, Peter Wurman, Peter Stone","The ability to approach the same problem from different angles is a cornerstone of human intelligence that leads to robust solutions and effective adaptation to problem variations. In contrast, current RL methodologies tend to lead to policies that settle on a single solution to a given problem, making them brittle to problem variations. Replicating human flexibility in reinforcement learning agents is the challenge that we explore in this work. We tackle this challenge by extending state-of-the-art approaches to introduce DUPLEX, a method that explicitly defines a diversity objective with constraints and makes robust estimates of policies’ expected behavior through successor features. The trained agents can (i) learn a diverse set of near-optimal policies in complex highly-dynamic environments and (ii) exhibit competitive and diverse skills in out-of-distribution (OOD) contexts. Empirical results indicate that DUPLEX improves over previous methods and successfully learns competitive driving styles in a hyper-realistic simulator (i.e., GranTurismo ™ 7) as well as diverse and effective policies in several multi-context robotics MuJoCo simulations with OOD gravity forces and height limits. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to achieve diverse solutions in complex driving simulators and OOD robotic contexts.

Poster,Discovering plasticity rules that organize and maintain neural circuits,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93653,"David Bell, Alison Duffy, Adrienne Fairhall","Intrinsic dynamics within the brain can accelerate learning by providing a prior scaffolding for dynamics aligned with task objectives. Such intrinsic dynamics would ideally self-organize and self-sustain in the face of biological noise including synaptic turnover and cell death. An example of such dynamics is the formation of sequences, a ubiquitous motif in neural activity. The sequence-generating circuit in zebra finch HVC provides a reliable timing scaffold for motor output in song and demonstrates a remarkable capacity for unsupervised recovery following perturbation. Inspired by HVC, we seek a local plasticity rule capable of organizing and maintaining sequence-generating dynamics despite continual network perturbations. We adopt a meta-learning approach introduced by Confavreux et al, which parameterizes a learning rule using basis functions constructed from pre- and postsynaptic activity and synapse size, with tunable time constants. Candidate rules are simulated within initially random networks, and their fitness is evaluated according to a loss function that measures the fidelity with which the resulting dynamics encode time. We use this approach to introduce biological noise, forcing meta-learning to find robust solutions. We first show that, in the absence of perturbations, meta-learning identifies a temporally asymmetric generalization of Oja's rule that reliably organizes sparse sequential activity. When synaptic turnover is introduced, the learned rule incorporates a form of homeostasis, better maintaining robust sequential dynamics relative to other previously proposed rules. Additionally, inspired by recent findings demonstrating that the strength of projections from inhibitory interneurons in HVC also dynamically responds to perturbations, we explore the role of inhibitory plasticity in sequence-generating circuits. We find that learned plasticity adjusts both excitation and inhibition in response to manipulations, outperforming rules applied only to excitatory connections. We demonstrate how plasticity acting on both excitatory and inhibitory synapses can better shape excitatory cell dynamics to scaffold timing representations."
Poster,Discovering Preference Optimization Algorithms with and for Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94244,"Chris Lu, Samuel Holt, Claudio Fanconi, Alex Chan, Jakob Foerster, Mihaela van der Schaar, Robert Lange","Offline preference optimization is a key method for enhancing and controlling the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs.Typically, preference optimization is approached as an offline supervised learning task using manually crafted convex loss functions. While these methods are based on theoretical insights, they are inherently constrained by human creativity, so the large search space of possible loss functions remains under-explored. We address this by performing LLM-driven *objective discovery* to automatically discover new state-of-the-art preference optimization algorithms without (expert) human intervention.  Specifically, we iteratively prompt an LLM to propose and implement new preference optimization loss functions based on previously evaluated performance metrics. This process leads to the discovery of previously unknown and performant preference optimization algorithms. The best performing of these we call *Discovered Preference Optimization* (DiscoPOP), a novel algorithm that adaptively blends logistic and exponential losses. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of DiscoPOP and its successful transfer to held-out tasks."
