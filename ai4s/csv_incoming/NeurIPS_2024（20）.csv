Poster,A hierarchical decomposition for explaining ML performance discrepancies,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93686,"Harvineet Singh, Fan Xia, Adarsh Subbaswamy, Alexej Gossmann, Jean Feng","Machine learning (ML) algorithms can often differ in performance across domains. Understanding why their performance differs is crucial for determining what types of interventions (e.g., algorithmic or operational) are most effective at closing the performance gaps. Aggregate decompositions express the total performance gap as the gap due to a shift in the feature distribution $p(X)$ plus the gap due to a shift in the outcome's conditional  distribution $p(Y|X)$. While this coarse explanation is helpful for guiding root cause analyses, it provides limited details and can only suggest coarse fixes involving all variables in an ML system. Detailed decompositions quantify the importance of each variable to each term in the aggregate decomposition, which can provide a deeper understanding and suggest more targeted interventions. Although parametric methods exist for conducting a full hierarchical decomposition of an algorithm's performance gap at the aggregate and detailed levels, current nonparametric methods only cover parts of the hierarchy; many also require knowledge of the entire causal graph. We introduce a nonparametric hierarchical framework for explaining why the performance of an ML algorithm differs across domains, without requiring causal knowledge. Furthermore, we derive debiased, computationally-efficient estimators and statistical inference procedures to construct confidence intervals for the explanations."
Poster,A Hitchhiker's Guide to Fine-Grained Face Forgery Detection Using Common Sense Reasoning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97603,"Niki M Foteinopoulou, Enjie Ghorbel, Djamila Aouada","Explainability in artificial intelligence is crucial for restoring trust, particularly in areas like face forgery detection, where viewers often struggle to distinguish between real and fabricated content. Vision and Large Language Models (VLLM) bridge computer vision and natural language, offering numerous applications driven by strong common-sense reasoning. Despite their success in various tasks, the potential of vision and language remains underexplored in face forgery detection, where they hold promise for enhancing explainability by leveraging the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of language to analyse fine-grained manipulation areas.    For that reason, few works have recently started to frame the problem of deepfake detection as a Visual Question Answering (VQA) task, nevertheless omitting the realistic and informative open-ended multi-label setting. With the rapid advances in the field of VLLM, an exponential rise of investigations in that direction is expected.    As such, there is a need for a clear experimental methodology that converts face forgery detection to a Visual Question Answering (VQA) task to systematically and fairly evaluate different VLLM architectures. Previous evaluation studies in deepfake detection have mostly focused on the simpler binary task, overlooking evaluation protocols for multi-label fine-grained detection and text-generative models. We propose a multi-staged approach that diverges from the traditional binary evaluation protocol and conducts a comprehensive evaluation study to compare the capabilities of several VLLMs in this context.    In the first stage, we assess the models' performance on the binary task and their sensitivity to given instructions using several prompts. In the second stage, we delve deeper into fine-grained detection by identifying areas of manipulation in a multiple-choice VQA setting. In the third stage, we convert the fine-grained detection to an open-ended question and compare several matching strategies for the multi-label classification task. Finally, we qualitatively evaluate the fine-grained responses of the VLLMs included in the benchmark.    We apply our benchmark to several popular models, providing a detailed comparison of binary, multiple-choice, and open-ended VQA evaluation across seven datasets. \url{https://nickyfot.github.io/hitchhickersguide.github.io/}"
Poster,A Huber Loss Minimization Approach to Mean Estimation under User-level Differential Privacy,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95005,"Puning Zhao, Lifeng LAI, Li Shen, Qingming Li, Jiafei Wu, Zhe Liu","Privacy protection of users' entire contribution of samples is important in distributed systems. The most effective approach is the two-stage scheme, which finds a small interval first and then gets a refined estimate by clipping samples into the interval. However, the clipping operation induces bias, which is serious if the sample distribution is heavy-tailed. Besides, users with large local sample sizes can make the sensitivity much larger, thus the method is not suitable for imbalanced users. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a Huber loss minimization approach to mean estimation under user-level differential privacy. The connecting points of Huber loss can be adaptively adjusted to deal with imbalanced users. Moreover, it avoids the clipping operation, thus significantly reducing the bias compared with the two-stage approach. We provide a theoretical analysis of our approach, which gives the noise strength needed for privacy protection, as well as the bound of mean squared error. The result shows that the new method is much less sensitive to the imbalance of user-wise sample sizes and the tail of sample distributions. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to validate our theoretical analysis."
Poster,AID: Attention Interpolation of Text-to-Image Diffusion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95427,"He Qiyuan, Jinghao Wang, Ziwei Liu, Angela Yao","Conditional diffusion models can create unseen images in various settings, aiding image interpolation. Interpolation in latent spaces is well-studied, but interpolation with specific conditions like text or image is less understood. Common approaches interpolate linearly in the conditioning space but tend to result in inconsistent images with poor fidelity. This work introduces a novel training-free technique named \textbf{Attention Interpolation via Diffusion (AID)}. AID has two key contributions: \textbf{1)} a fused inner/outer interpolated attention layer to boost image consistency and fidelity; and \textbf{2)} selection of interpolation coefficients via a beta distribution to increase smoothness. Additionally, we present an AID variant called \textbf{Prompt-guided Attention Interpolation via Diffusion (PAID)}, which \textbf{3)} treats interpolation as a condition-dependent generative process. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves greater consistency, smoothness, and efficiency in condition-based interpolation, aligning closely with human preferences. Furthermore, PAID offers substantial benefits for compositional generation, controlled image editing, image morphing and image-controlled generation, all while remaining training-free."
Poster,AirSketch: Generative Motion to Sketch,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93309,"Hui Xian Grace Lim, Xuanming Cui, Yogesh Rawat, Ser Nam Lim","Illustration is a fundamental mode of human expression and communication. Certain types of motion that accompany speech can provide this illustrative mode of communication. While Augmented and Virtual Reality technologies (AR/VR) have introduced tools for producing drawings with hand motions (air drawing), they typically require costly hardware and additional digital markers, thereby limiting their accessibility and portability. Furthermore, air drawing demands considerable skill to achieve aesthetic results. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of AirSketch, aimed at generating faithful and visually coherent sketches directly from hand motions, eliminating the need for complicated headsets or markers. We devise a simple augmentation-based self-supervised training procedure, enabling a controllable image diffusion model to learn to translate from highly noisy hand tracking images to clean, aesthetically pleasing sketches, while preserving the essential visual cues from the original tracking data. We present two air drawing datasets to study this problem. Our findings demonstrate that beyond producing photo-realistic images from precise spatial inputs, controllable image diffusion can effectively produce a refined, clear sketch from a noisy input. Our work serves as an initial step towards marker-less air drawing and reveals distinct applications of controllable diffusion models to AirSketch and AR/VR in general."
Poster,A Kernel Perspective on Distillation-based Collaborative Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95580,"Sejun Park, Kihun Hong, Ganguk Hwang","Over the past decade, there is a growing interest in collaborative learning that can enhance AI models of multiple parties.However, it is still challenging to enhance performance them without sharing private data and models from individual parties.One recent promising approach is to develop distillation-based algorithms that exploit unlabeled public data but the results are still unsatisfactory in both theory and practice.To tackle this problem, we rigorously analyze a representative distillation-based algorithm in the view of kernel regression.This work provides the first theoretical results to prove the (nearly) minimax optimality of the nonparametric collaborative learning algorithm that does not directly share local data or models in massively distributed statistically heterogeneous environments.Inspired by our theoretical results, we also propose a practical distillation-based collaborative learning algorithm based on neural network architecture.Our algorithm successfully bridges the gap between our theoretical assumptions and practical settings with neural networks through feature kernel matching.We simulate various regression tasks to verify our theory and demonstrate the practical feasibility of our proposed algorithm."
Poster,A Label is Worth A Thousand Images in Dataset Distillation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93630,"Tian Qin, Zhiwei Deng, David Alvarez-Melis","Data *quality* is a crucial factor in the performance of machine learning models, a principle that dataset distillation methods exploit by compressing training datasets into much smaller counterparts that maintain similar downstream performance. Understanding how and why data distillation methods work is vital not only for improving these methods but also for revealing fundamental characteristics of ""good” training data. However, a major challenge in achieving this goal is the observation that distillation approaches, which rely on sophisticated but mostly disparate methods to generate synthetic data, have little in common with each other. In this work, we highlight a largely overlooked aspect common to most of these methods: the use of soft (probabilistic) labels. Through a series of ablation experiments, we study the role of soft labels in depth. Our results reveal that the main factor explaining the performance of state-of-the-art distillation methods is not the specific techniques used to generate synthetic data but rather the use of soft labels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that not all soft labels are created equal; they must contain *structured information* to be beneficial. We also provide empirical scaling laws that characterize the effectiveness of soft labels as a function of images-per-class in the distilled dataset and establish an empirical Pareto frontier for data-efficient learning. Combined, our findings challenge conventional wisdom in dataset distillation, underscore the importance of soft labels in learning, and suggest new directions for improving distillation methods.

Poster,A Large-Scale Human-Centric Benchmark for Referring Expression Comprehension in the LMM Era,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97836,"Fangyun Wei, Jinjing Zhao, Kun Yan, Hongyang Zhang, Chang Xu","Prior research in human-centric AI has primarily addressed single-modality tasks like pedestrian detection, action recognition, and pose estimation. However, the emergence of large multimodal models (LMMs) such as GPT-4V has redirected attention towards integrating language with visual content. Referring expression comprehension (REC) represents a prime example of this multimodal approach. Current human-centric REC benchmarks, typically sourced from general datasets, fall short in the LMM era due to their limitations, such as insufficient testing samples, overly concise referring expressions, and limited vocabulary, making them inadequate for evaluating the full capabilities of modern REC models. In response, we present HC-RefLoCo (Human-Centric Referring Expression Comprehension with Long Context), a benchmark that includes 13,452 images, 24,129 instances, and 44,738 detailed annotations, encompassing a vocabulary of 18,681 words. Each annotation, meticulously reviewed for accuracy, averages 93.2 words and includes topics such as appearance, human-object interaction, location, action, celebrity, and OCR. HC-RefLoCo provides a wider range of instance scales and diverse evaluation protocols, encompassing accuracy with various IoU criteria, scale-aware evaluation, and subject-specific assessments. Our experiments, which assess 24 models, highlight HC-RefLoCo’s potential to advance human-centric AI by challenging contemporary REC models with comprehensive and varied data. Our benchmark, along with the evaluation code, are available at https://github.com/ZhaoJingjing713/HC-RefLoCo."
Poster,A Layer-Wise Natural Gradient Optimizer for Training Deep Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93672,"Xiaolei Liu, Shaoshuai Li, Kaixin Gao, Binfeng Wang","Second-order optimization algorithms, such as the Newton method and the natural gradient descent (NGD) method exhibit excellent convergence properties for training deep neural networks, but the high computational cost limits its practical application. In this paper, we focus on the NGD method and propose a novel layer-wise natural gradient descent (LNGD) method to further reduce computational costs and accelerate the training process. Specifically, based on the block diagonal approximation of the Fisher information matrix, we first propose the layer-wise sample method to compute each block matrix without performing a complete back-propagation. Then, each block matrix is approximated as a Kronecker product of two smaller matrices, one of which is a diagonal matrix, while keeping the traces equal before and after approximation. By these two steps, we provide a new approximation for the Fisher information matrix, which can effectively reduce the computational cost while preserving the main information of each block matrix. Moreover, we propose a new adaptive layer-wise learning rate to further accelerate training. Based on these new approaches, we propose the LNGD optimizer. The global convergence analysis of LNGD is established under some assumptions. Experiments on image classification and machine translation tasks show that our method is quite competitive compared to the state-of-the-art methods."
Poster,AlchemistCoder: Harmonizing and Eliciting Code Capability by Hindsight Tuning on Multi-source Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95123,"Zifan Song, Yudong Wang, Wenwei Zhang, Kuikun Liu, Chengqi Lyu, Demin Song, Qipeng Guo, Hang Yan, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen, Cairong Zhao","Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and their specialized variants, particularly Code LLMs, have recently delivered impressive performance. However, previous Code LLMs are typically fine-tuned on single-source data with limited quality and diversity, which may insufficiently elicit the potential of pre-trained Code LLMs. In this paper, we present AlchemistCoder, a series of Code LLMs with enhanced code generation and generalization capabilities fine-tuned on multi-source data. To achieve this, we pioneer to unveil inherent conflicts among the various styles and qualities in multi-source code corpora and introduce data-specific prompts with hindsight relabeling, termed AlchemistPrompts, to harmonize different data sources and instruction-response pairs. Additionally, we propose incorporating the data construction process into the fine-tuning data as code comprehension tasks, including instruction evolution, data filtering, and code review. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlchemistCoder holds a clear lead among all models of the same size (6.7B/7B) and rivals or even surpasses larger models (15B/33B/70B), showcasing the efficacy of our method in refining instruction-following capabilities and advancing the boundaries of code intelligence.
