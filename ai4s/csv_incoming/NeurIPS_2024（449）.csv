Poster,Who Evaluates the Evaluations? Objectively Scoring Text-to-Image Prompt Coherence Metrics with T2IScoreScore (TS2),https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95132,"Michael Saxon, Fatima Jahara, Mahsa Khoshnoodi, Yujie Lu, Aditya Sharma, William Yang Wang","With advances in the quality of text-to-image (T2I) models has come interest in benchmarking their prompt faithfulness---the semantic coherence of generated images to the prompts they were conditioned on. A variety of T2I faithfulness metrics have been proposed, leveraging advances in cross-modal embeddings and vision-language models (VLMs). However, these metrics are not rigorously compared and benchmarked, instead presented with correlation to human Likert scores over a set of easy-to-discriminate images against seemingly weak baselines. We introduce T2IScoreScore, a curated set of semantic error graphs containing a prompt and a set of increasingly erroneous images. These allow us to rigorously judge whether a given prompt faithfulness metric can correctly order images with respect to their objective error count and significantly discriminate  between different error nodes, using meta-metric scores derived from established statistical tests. Surprisingly, we find that the state-of-the-art VLM-based metrics (e.g., TIFA, DSG, LLMScore, VIEScore) we tested fail to significantly outperform simple (and supposedly worse) feature-based metrics like CLIPScore, particularly on a hard subset of naturally-occurring T2I model errors. TS2 will enable the development of better T2I prompt faithfulness metrics through more rigorous comparison of their conformity to expected orderings and separations under objective criteria."
Poster,Who's asking? User personas and the mechanics of latent misalignment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94269,"Asma Ghandeharioun, Ann Yuan, Marius Guerard, Emily Reif, Michael Lepori, Lucas Dixon","Studies show that safety-tuned models may nevertheless divulge harmful information. In this work, we show that whether they do so depends significantly on who they are talking to, which we refer to as *user persona*. In fact, we find manipulating user persona to be more effective for eliciting harmful content than certain more direct attempts to control model refusal. We study both natural language prompting and activation steering as intervention methods and show that activation steering is significantly more effective at bypassing safety filters.We shed light on the mechanics of this phenomenon by showing that even when model generations are safe, harmful content can persist in hidden representations and can be extracted by decoding from earlier layers.  We also show we can predict a persona’s effect on refusal given only the geometry of its steering vector. Finally, we show that certain user personas induce the model to form more charitable interpretations of otherwise dangerous queries."
Poster,Who’s Gaming the System? A Causally-Motivated Approach for Detecting Strategic Adaptation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95302,"Trenton Chang, Lindsay Warrenburg, Sae-Hwan Park, Ravi Parikh, Maggie Makar, Jenna Wiens","In many settings, machine learning models may be used to inform decisions that impact individuals or entities who interact with the model. Such entities, or *agents,* may *game* model decisions by manipulating their inputs to the model to obtain better outcomes and maximize some utility. We consider a multi-agent setting where the goal is to identify the “worst offenders:” agents that are gaming most aggressively. However, identifying such agents is difficult without knowledge of their utility function. Thus, we introduce a framework in which each agent’s tendency to game is parameterized via a scalar. We show that this gaming parameter is only partially identifiable. By recasting the problem as a causal effect estimation problem where different agents represent different “treatments,” we prove that a ranking of all agents by their gaming parameters is identifiable. We present empirical results in a synthetic data study validating the usage of causal effect estimation for gaming detection and show in a case study of diagnosis coding behavior in the U.S. that our approach highlights features associated with gaming."
Poster,Why are Visually-Grounded Language Models Bad at Image Classification?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95478,"Yuhui Zhang, Alyssa Unell, Xiaohan Wang, Dhruba Ghosh, Yuchang Su, Ludwig Schmidt, Serena Yeung","Image classification is one of the most fundamental capabilities of machine vision intelligence. In this work, we revisit the image classification task using visually-grounded language models (VLMs) such as GPT-4V and LLaVA. We find that existing proprietary and public VLMs, despite often using CLIP as a vision encoder and having many more parameters, significantly underperform CLIP on standard image classification benchmarks like ImageNet. To understand the reason, we explore several hypotheses concerning the inference algorithms, training objectives, and data processing in VLMs. Our analysis reveals that the primary cause is data-related: critical information for image classification is encoded in the VLM's latent space but can only be effectively decoded with enough training data. Specifically, there is a strong correlation between the frequency of class exposure during VLM training and instruction-tuning and the VLM's performance in those classes; when trained with sufficient data, VLMs can match the accuracy of state-of-the-art classification models. Based on these findings, we enhance a VLM by integrating classification-focused datasets into its training, and demonstrate that the enhanced classification performance of the VLM transfers to its general capabilities, resulting in an improvement of 11.8% on the newly collected ImageWikiQA dataset."
Poster,Why Do We Need Weight Decay in Modern Deep Learning?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94670,"Francesco D&#x27;Angelo, Maksym Andriushchenko, Aditya  Vardhan Varre, Nicolas Flammarion","Weight decay is a broadly used technique for training state-of-the-art deep networks from image classification to large language models. Despite its widespread usage and being extensively studied in the classical literature, its role remains poorly understood for deep learning. In this work, we highlight that the role of weight decay in modern deep learning is different from its regularization effect studied in classical learning theory. For deep networks on vision tasks trained with multipass SGD, we show how weight decay modifies the optimization dynamics enhancing the ever-present implicit regularization of SGD via the *loss stabilization mechanism*. In contrast, for large language models trained with nearly one-epoch training, we describe how weight decay balances the *bias-variance tradeoff* in stochastic optimization leading to lower training loss and improved training stability. Overall, we present a unifying perspective from ResNets on vision tasks to LLMs: weight decay is never useful as an explicit regularizer but instead changes the training dynamics in a desirable way."
Poster,Why Go Full? Elevating Federated Learning Through Partial Network Updates,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96529,"Haolin Wang, Xuefeng Liu, Jianwei Niu, Wenkai Guo, Shaojie Tang","Federated learning is a distributed machine learning paradigm designed to protect user data privacy, which has been successfully implemented across various scenarios. In traditional federated learning, the entire parameter set of local models is updated and averaged in each training round. Although this full network update method maximizes knowledge acquisition and sharing for each model layer, it prevents the layers of the global model from cooperating effectively to complete the tasks of each client, a challenge we refer to as layer mismatch. This mismatch problem recurs after every parameter averaging, consequently slowing down model convergence and degrading overall performance. To address the layer mismatch issue, we introduce the FedPart method, which restricts model updates to either a single layer or a few layers during each communication round. Furthermore, to maintain the efficiency of knowledge acquisition and sharing, we develop several strategies to select trainable layers in each round, including sequential updating and multi-round cycle training. Through both theoretical analysis and experiments, our findings demonstrate that the FedPart method significantly surpasses conventional full network update strategies in terms of convergence speed and accuracy, while also reducing communication and computational overheads."
Poster,Why the Metric Backbone Preserves Community Structure,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95632,"Maximilien Dreveton, Charbel Chucri, Matthias Grossglauser, Patrick Thiran","The metric backbone of a weighted graph is the union of all-pairs shortest paths. It is obtained by removing all edges $(u,v)$ that are not the shortest path between $u$ and $v$. In networks with well-separated communities, the metric backbone tends to preserve many inter-community edges, because these edges serve as bridges connecting two communities, but tends to delete many intra-community edges because the communities are dense. This suggests that the metric backbone would dilute or destroy the community structure of the network. However, this is not borne out by prior empirical work, which instead showed that the metric backbone of real networks preserves the community structure of the original network well. In this work, we analyze the metric backbone of a broad class of weighted random graphs with communities, and we formally prove the robustness of the community structure with respect to the deletion of all the edges that are not in the metric backbone. An empirical comparison of several graph sparsification techniques confirms our theoretical finding and shows that the metric backbone is an efficient sparsifier in the presence of communities."
Poster,Why Transformers Need Adam: A Hessian Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94790,"Yushun Zhang, Congliang Chen, Tian Ding, Ziniu Li, Ruoyu Sun, Zhiquan Luo","SGD performs worse than Adam by a significant margin on Transformers, but the reason remains unclear. In this work, we provide an explanation through the lens of Hessian: (i) Transformers are ""heterogeneous'': the Hessian spectrum across parameter blocks vary dramatically, a phenomenon we call ""block heterogeneity""; (ii) Heterogeneity hampers SGD: SGD performs worse than Adam on problems with block heterogeneity.  To validate (i) and (ii), we check various Transformers, CNNs, MLPs, and quadratic problems, and find that SGD can perform on par with Adam on problems without block heterogeneity, but performs worse than Adam when the heterogeneity exists. Our initial theoretical analysis indicates that SGD performs worse because it applies one single learning rate to all blocks, which cannot handle the heterogeneity among blocks. This limitation could be ameliorated if we use coordinate-wise learning rates, as designed in Adam."
Poster,Why Warmup the Learning Rate? Underlying Mechanisms and Improvements,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95431,"Dayal Singh Kalra, Maissam Barkeshli","In modern deep learning, it is common to warm up the learning rate $\eta$, often by a linear schedule between $\eta_{\text{init}} = 0$ and a predetermined target $\eta_{\text{trgt}}$. In this paper, we show through systematic experiments with SGD and Adam that the overwhelming benefit of warmup arises from allowing the network to tolerate larger $\eta_{\text{trgt}}$ by forcing the network to more well-conditioned areas of the loss landscape. The ability to handle larger target learning rates in turn makes hyperparameter tuning more robust while improving the final performance of the network. We uncover different regimes of operation during the warmup period, depending on whether the network training starts off in a progressive sharpening or sharpness reduction phase, which in turn depends on the initialization and parameterization. Using these insights, we show how $\eta_{\text{init}}$ can be properly chosen by utilizing the loss catapult mechanism, which saves on the number of warmup steps, in some cases completely eliminating the need for warmup. We also suggest an initialization for the variance in Adam, which provides benefits similar to warmup."
Poster,Wide Two-Layer Networks can Learn from Adversarial Perturbations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96861,"Soichiro Kumano, Hiroshi Kera, Toshihiko Yamasaki","Adversarial examples have raised several open questions, such as why they can deceive classifiers and transfer between different models. A prevailing hypothesis to explain these phenomena suggests that adversarial perturbations appear as random noise but contain class-specific features. This hypothesis is supported by the success of perturbation learning, where classifiers trained solely on adversarial examples and the corresponding incorrect labels generalize well to correctly labeled test data. Although this hypothesis and perturbation learning are effective in explaining intriguing properties of adversarial examples, their solid theoretical foundation is limited. In this study, we theoretically explain the counterintuitive success of perturbation learning. We assume wide two-layer networks and the results hold for any data distribution. We prove that adversarial perturbations contain sufficient class-specific features for networks to generalize from them. Moreover, the predictions of classifiers trained on mislabeled adversarial examples coincide with those of classifiers trained on correctly labeled clean samples. The code is available at https://github.com/s-kumano/perturbation-learning."
