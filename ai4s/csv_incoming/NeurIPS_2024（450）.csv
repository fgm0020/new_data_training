Poster,WikiContradict: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on Real-World Knowledge Conflicts from Wikipedia,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97844,"Yufang Hou, Alessandra Pascale, Javier Carnerero-Cano, Tigran Tchrakian, Radu Marinescu, Elizabeth Daly, Inkit Padhi, Prasanna Sattigeri","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate the limitations of large language models (LLMs), such as hallucinations and outdated information. However, it remains unclear how LLMs handle knowledge conflicts arising from different augmented retrieved passages, especially when these passages originate from the same source and have equal trustworthiness. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-generated answers to questions that have varying answers based on contradictory passages from Wikipedia, a dataset widely regarded as a high-quality pre-training resource for most LLMs. Specifically, we introduce WikiContradict, a benchmark consisting of 253 high-quality, human-annotated instances designed to assess the performance of LLMs in providing a complete perspective on conflicts from the retrieved documents, rather than choosing one answer over another, when augmented with retrieved passages containing real-world knowledge conflicts. We benchmark a diverse range of both closed and open-source LLMs under different QA scenarios, including RAG with a single  passage, and RAG with 2 contradictory passages. Through rigorous human evaluations on a subset of WikiContradict instances involving 5 LLMs and over 3,500 judgements, we shed light on the behaviour and limitations of these models. For instance, when provided with two passages containing contradictory facts, all models struggle to generate answers that accurately reflect the conflicting nature of the context, especially for implicit conflicts requiring reasoning. Since human evaluation is costly, wealso introduce an automated model that estimates LLM performance using a strong open-source language model, achieving an F-score of 0.8. Using this automated metric, we evaluate more than 1,500 answers from seven LLMs across all WikiContradict instances."
Poster,WikiDBs: A Large-Scale Corpus Of Relational Databases From Wikidata,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97622,"Liane Vogel, Jan-Micha Bodensohn, Carsten Binnig","Deep learning on tabular data, and particularly tabular representation learning, has recently gained growing interest. However, representation learning for relational databases with multiple tables is still an underexplored area, which may be attributed to the lack of openly available resources. To support the development of foundation models for tabular data and relational databases, we introduce WikiDBs, a novel open-source corpus of 100,000 relational databases. Each database consists of multiple tables connected by foreign keys. The corpus is based on Wikidata and aims to follow certain characteristics of real-world databases. In this paper, we describe the dataset and our method for creating it. By making our code publicly available, we enable others to create tailored versions of the dataset, for example, by creating databases in different languages. Finally, we conduct a set of initial experiments to showcase how WikiDBs can be used to train for data engineering tasks, such as missing value imputation and column type annotation."
Poster,WikiDO: A New Benchmark Evaluating Cross-Modal Retrieval for Vision-Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97785,"Pavan Kalyan Tankala, Piyush Pasi, Sahil Dharod, Azeem Motiwala, Preethi Jyothi, Aditi Chaudhary, Krishna Srinivasan","Cross-modal (image-to-text and text-to-image) retrieval is an established task used in evaluation benchmarks to test the performance of vision-language models (VLMs). Several state-of-the-art VLMs (e.g. CLIP, BLIP-2) have achieved near-perfect performance on widely-used image-text retrieval benchmarks such as MSCOCO-Test-5K and Flickr30K-Test-1K. As a measure of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, prior works rely on zero-shot performance evaluated on one dataset (Flickr) using a VLM finetuned on another one (MSCOCO). We argue that such comparisons are insufficient to assess the OOD generalization capability of models due to high visual and linguistic similarity between the evaluation and finetuning datasets. To address this gap, we introduce WikiDO (drawn from Wikipedia Diversity Observatory), a novel cross-modal retrieval benchmark to assess the OOD generalization capabilities of pretrained VLMs. This consists of newly scraped 380K image-text pairs from Wikipedia with domain labels, a carefully curated, human-verified a)in-distribution (ID) test set (3K) and b) OOD test set (3K). The image-text pairs are very diverse in topics and geographical locations. We evaluate different VLMs of varying capacity on the \wikido benchmark; BLIP-2 achieves zero-shot performance of $R@1\approx66\%$ on the OOD test set, compared to $\approx$ $81\%$ on COCO and $\approx95\%$ on Flickr. When fine-tuned on WikiDO, the $R@1$ improvement is at most $\approx5\%$ on OOD instances compared to $\approx12\%$ on ID instances. We probe the VLMs with varying finetuning objectives and datasets of varying sizes to identify what aids OOD generalization the most. Our results confirm that WikiDO offers a strong cross-modal benchmark for current VLMs in specifically evaluating for OOD generalization. Our benchmark is hosted as a competition at https://kaggle.com/competitions/wikido24 with public access to dataset and code."
Poster,WildGaussians: 3D Gaussian Splatting In the Wild,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95434,"Jonas Kulhanek, Songyou Peng, Zuzana Kukelova, Marc Pollefeys, Torsten Sattler","While the field of 3D scene reconstruction is dominated by NeRFs due to their photorealistic quality, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged, offering similar quality with real-time rendering speeds. However, both methods primarily excel with well-controlled 3D scenes, while in-the-wild data - characterized by occlusions, dynamic objects, and varying illumination - remains challenging. NeRFs can adapt to such conditions easily through per-image embedding vectors, but 3DGS struggles due to its explicit representation and lack of shared parameters. To address this, we introduce WildGaussians, a novel approach to handle occlusions and appearance changes with 3DGS. By leveraging robust DINO features and integrating an appearance modeling module within 3DGS, our method achieves state-of-the-art results. We demonstrate that WildGaussians matches the real-time rendering speed of 3DGS while surpassing both 3DGS and NeRF baselines in handling in-the-wild data, all within a simple architectural framework."
Poster,Wild-GS: Real-Time Novel View Synthesis from Unconstrained Photo Collections,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95071,"Jiacong Xu, Yiqun Mei, Vishal Patel","Photographs captured in unstructured tourist environments frequently exhibit variable appearances and transient occlusions, challenging accurate scene reconstruction and inducing artifacts in novel view synthesis. Although prior approaches have integrated the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) with additional learnable modules to handle the dynamic appearances and eliminate transient objects, their extensive training demands and slow rendering speeds limit practical deployments. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising alternative to NeRF, offering superior training and inference efficiency along with better rendering quality. This paper presents \textit{Wild-GS}, an innovative adaptation of 3DGS optimized for unconstrained photo collections while preserving its efficiency benefits. \textit{Wild-GS} determines the appearance of each 3D Gaussian by their inherent material attributes, global illumination and camera properties per image, and point-level local variance of reflectance. Unlike previous methods that model reference features in image space, \textit{Wild-GS} explicitly aligns the pixel appearance features to the corresponding local Gaussians by sampling the triplane extracted from the reference image. This novel design effectively transfers the high-frequency detailed appearance of the reference view to 3D space and significantly expedites the training process. Furthermore, 2D visibility maps and depth regularization are leveraged to mitigate the transient effects and constrain the geometry, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textit{Wild-GS} achieves state-of-the-art rendering performance and the highest efficiency in both training and inference among all the existing techniques.

Poster,"WildGuard: Open One-stop Moderation Tools for Safety Risks, Jailbreaks, and Refusals of LLMs",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97764,"Seungju Han, Kavel Rao, Allyson Ettinger, Liwei Jiang, Bill Yuchen Lin, Nathan Lambert, Yejin Choi, Nouha Dziri","We introduce WildGuard---an open, light-weight moderation tool for LLM safety that achieves three goals: (1) identifying malicious intent in user prompts, (2) detecting safety risks of model responses, and (3) determining model refusal rate. Together, WildGuard serves the increasing needs for automatic safety moderation and evaluation of LLM interactions, providing a one-stop tool with enhanced accuracy and broad coverage across 13 risk categories. While existing open moderation tools such as Llama-Guard2 score reasonably well in classifying straightforward model interactions, they lag far behind a prompted GPT-4, especially in identifying adversarial jailbreaks  and in evaluating models' refusals, a key measure for evaluating safety behaviors in model responses. To address these challenges, we construct WildGuardMix, a large-scale and carefully balanced multi-task safety moderation dataset with 92K labeled examples that cover vanilla (direct) prompts and adversarial jailbreaks, paired with various refusal and compliance responses. WildGuardMix is a combination of WildGuardTrain, the training data of WildGuard, and WildGuardTest, a high-quality human-annotated moderation test set with 5K labeled items covering broad risk scenarios.Through extensive evaluations on WildGuardTest and ten existing public benchmarks, we show that WildGuard establishes state-of-the-art performance in open-source safety moderation across all the three tasks compared to ten strong existing open-source moderation models (e.g., up to 25.3% improvement on refusal detection). Importantly, WildGuard matches and sometimes exceeds GPT-4 performance (e.g., up to 4.8% improvement on prompt harmfulness identification). WildGuard serves as a highly effective safety moderator in an LLM interface, reducing the success rate of jailbreak attacks from 79.8%  to 2.4%. We will make all our data, models and training/evaluation code publicly available under CC BY 4.0 license."
Poster,WildPPG: A Real-World PPG Dataset of Long Continuous Recordings,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97729,"Manuel Meier, Berken Utku Demirel, Christian Holz","Reflective photoplethysmography (PPG) has become the default sensing technique in wearable devices to monitor cardiac activity via a person’s heart rate (HR). However, PPG-based HR estimates can be substantially impacted by factors such as the wearer’s activities, sensor placement and resulting motion artifacts, as well as environmental characteristics such as temperature and ambient light. These and other factors can significantly impact and decrease HR prediction reliability. In this paper, we show that state-of-the-art HR estimation methods struggle when processing representative data from everyday activities in outdoor environments, likely because they rely on existing datasets that captured controlled conditions. We introduce a novel multimodal dataset and benchmark results for continuous PPG recordings during outdoor activities from 16 participants over 13.5 hours, captured from four wearable sensors, each worn at a different location on the body, totaling 216 hours. Our recordings include accelerometer, temperature, and altitude data, as well as a synchronized Lead I-based electrocardiogram for ground-truth HR references. Participants completed a round trip from Zurich to Jungfraujoch, a tall mountain in Switzerland over the course of one day. The trip included outdoor and indoor activities such as walking, hiking, stair climbing, eating, drinking, and resting at various temperatures and altitudes (up to 3,571 m above sea level) as well as using cars, trains, cable cars, and lifts for transport—all of which impacted participants’ physiological dynamics. We also present a novel method that estimates HR values more robustly in such real-world scenarios than existing baselines.Dataset & code for HR estimation: https://siplab.org/projects/WildPPG"
Poster,WildTeaming at Scale: From In-the-Wild Jailbreaks to (Adversarially) Safer Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93716,"Liwei Jiang, Kavel Rao, Seungju Han, Allyson Ettinger, Faeze Brahman, Sachin Kumar, Niloofar Mireshghallah, Ximing Lu, Maarten Sap, Yejin Choi, Nouha Dziri","We introduce WildTeaming, an automatic red-teaming framework that mines in-the-wild user-chatbot interactions to discover 5.7K unique clusters of novel jailbreak tactics, and then composes selections of multiple mined tactics for systematic exploration of novel and even more challenging jailbreaks.Compared to prior work that performed red-teaming via recruited human workers, gradient-based optimization, or iterative revision with large language models (LLMs), our work investigates jailbreaks from chatbot users in-the-wild who were not specifically instructed to break the system.  WildTeaming reveals previously unidentified vulnerabilities of frontier LLMs, resulting in more diverse and successful adversarial attacks compared to state-of-the-art jailbreaking methods. While there exist many datasets for jailbreak evaluation, very few open-source datasets exist for jailbreak training, as safety training data has been closed among all frontier models even when their weights are open. Therefore, with WildTeaming we create WildJailbreak, a large-scale open-source synthetic safety dataset with 262K vanilla (direct request) and adversarial (complex jailbreak) prompt-response pairs. In order to mitigate exaggerated safety behaviors, WildJailbreak provides two contrastive types of queries: 1) harmful queries (both vanilla and adversarial) and 2) benign queries that resemble harmful queries in form but contain no harmful intent. As WildJailbreak considerably upgrades the quality and scale of existing safety resources, it uniquely enables us to examine the scaling effects of data and the interplay of data properties and model capabilities during safety training. Through extensive model training and evaluations, we identify the training properties that enable an ideal balance of safety behaviors: appropriate safeguarding without over-refusal, effective handling of both vanilla and adversarial queries, and minimal, if any, decrease in general capabilities. All the components of WildJailbreak contribute to achieving balanced safety behaviors of models"
Poster,WildVision: Evaluating Vision-Language Models in the Wild with Human Preferences,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97560,"Yujie Lu, Dongfu Jiang, Wenhu Chen, William Yang Wang, Yejin Choi, Bill Yuchen Lin","Recent breakthroughs in vision-language models (VLMs) emphasize the necessity of benchmarking human preferences in real-world multimodal interactions. To address this gap, we launched WildVision-Arena (WV-Arena), an online platform that collects human preferences to evaluate VLMs. We curated WV-Bench by selecting 500 high-quality samples from 8,000 user submissions in WV-Arena. WV-Bench uses GPT-4 as the judge to compare each VLM with Claude-3-Sonnet, achieving a Spearman correlation of 0.94 with the WV-Arena Elo. This significantly outperforms other benchmarks like MMVet, MMMU, and MMStar.Our comprehensive analysis of 20K real-world interactions reveals important insights into the failure cases of top-performing VLMs. For example, we find that although GPT-4V surpasses many other models like Reka-Flash, Opus, and Yi-VL-Plus in simple visual recognition and reasoning tasks, it still faces challenges with subtle contextual cues, spatial reasoning, visual imagination, and expert domain knowledge. Additionally, current VLMs exhibit issues with hallucinations and safety when intentionally provoked. We are releasing our chat and feedback data to further advance research in the field of VLMs."
Poster,WindsorML: High-Fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics Dataset For Automotive Aerodynamics,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97656,"Neil Ashton, Jordan Angel, Aditya Ghate, Gaetan Kenway, Man Long Wong, Cetin Kiris, Astrid Walle, Danielle Maddix, Gary Page","This paper presents a new open-source high-fidelity dataset for Machine Learning (ML) containing 355 geometric variants of the Windsor body, to help the development and testing of ML surrogate models for external automotive aerodynamics. Each Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation was run with a GPU-native high-fidelity Wall-Modeled Large-Eddy Simulations (WMLES) using a Cartesian immersed-boundary method using more than 280M cells to ensure the greatest possible accuracy. The dataset contains geometry variants that exhibits a wide range of flow characteristics that are representative of those observed on road-cars. The dataset itself contains the 3D time-averaged volume \& boundary data as well as the geometry and force \& moment coefficients. This paper discusses the validation of the underlying CFD methods as well as contents and structure of the dataset. To the authors knowledge, this represents the first, large-scale high-fidelity CFD dataset for the Windsor body with a permissive open-source license (CC-BY-SA)."
