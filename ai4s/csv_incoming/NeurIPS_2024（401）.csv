Poster,The Impact of Geometric Complexity on Neural Collapse in Transfer Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95317,"Michael Munn, Benoit Dherin, Javier Gonzalvo","Many of the recent advances in computer vision and language models can be attributed to the success of transfer learning via the pre-training of large foundation models. However, a theoretical framework which explains this empirical success is incomplete and remains an active area of research. Flatness of the loss surface and neural collapse have recently emerged as useful pre-training metrics which shed light on the implicit biases underlying pre-training. In this paper, we explore the geometric complexity of a model's learned representations as a fundamental mechanism that relates these two concepts. We show through experiments and theory that mechanisms which affect the geometric complexity of the pre-trained network also influence the neural collapse. Furthermore, we show how this effect of the geometric complexity generalizes to the neural collapse of new classes as well, thus encouraging better performance on downstream tasks, particularly in the few-shot setting."
Poster,The Impact of Initialization on LoRA Finetuning Dynamics,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93375,"Soufiane Hayou, Nikhil Ghosh, Bin Yu","In this paper, we study the role of initialization in Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as originally introduced in Hu et al. (2021). Essentially, to start from the pretrained model, one can either initialize $B$ to zero and $A$ to random, or vice-versa. In both cases, the product $BA$ is equal to zero at initialization, which makes finetuning starts from the pretrained model. These two initialization schemes are seemingly similar. They should in-principle yield the same performance and share the same optimal learning rate. We demonstrate that this is an *incorrect intuition* and that the first scheme (of initializing $B$ to zero and $A$ to random) on average in our experiments yields better performance compared to the other scheme. Our theoretical analysis shows that the reason behind this might be that the first initialization allows the use of larger learning rates (without causing output instability) compared to the second initialization, resulting in more efficient learning of the first scheme. We validate our results with extensive experiments on LLMs."
Poster,The Implicit Bias of Adam on Separable Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93086,"Chenyang Zhang, Difan Zou, Yuan Cao","Adam has become one of the most favored optimizers in deep learning problems. Despite its success in practice, numerous mysteries persist regarding its theoretical understanding. In this paper, we study the implicit bias of Adam in linear logistic regression. Specifically, we show that when the training data are linearly separable, the iterates of Adam converge towards a linear classifier that achieves the maximum $\ell_\infty$-margin in direction. Notably, for a general class of diminishing learning rates, this convergence occurs within polynomial time. Our result shed light on the difference between Adam and (stochastic) gradient descent from a theoretical perspective."
Poster,The Implicit Bias of Gradient Descent on Separable Multiclass Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95699,"Hrithik Ravi, Clay Scott, Daniel Soudry, Yutong Wang","Implicit bias describes the phenomenon where optimization-based training algorithms, without explicit regularization, show a preference for simple estimators even when more complex estimators have equal objective values. Multiple works have developed the theory of implicit bias for binary classification under the assumption that the loss satisfies an *exponential tail property*. However, there is a noticeable gap in analysis for multiclass classification, with only a handful of results which themselves are restricted to the cross-entropy loss. In this work, we employ the framework of Permutation Equivariant and Relative Margin-based (PERM) losses [Wang and Scott, 2024] to introduce a multiclass extension of the exponential tail property. This class of losses includes not only cross-entropy but also other losses. Using this framework, we extend the implicit bias result of Soudry et al. [2018] to multiclass classification. Furthermore, our proof techniques closely mirror those of the binary case, thus illustrating the power of the PERM framework for bridging the binary-multiclass gap."
Poster,The Implicit Bias of Gradient Descent toward Collaboration between Layers: A Dynamic Analysis of Multilayer Perceptions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93957,"Zheng Wang, Geyong Min, Wenjie Ruan","The implicit bias of gradient descent has long been considered the primary mechanism explaining the superior generalization of over-parameterized neural networks without overfitting, even when the training error is zero. However, the implicit bias toward adversarial robustness has rarely been considered in the research community, although it is crucial for the trustworthiness of machine learning models. To fill this gap, in this paper, we explore whether consecutive layers collaborate to strengthen adversarial robustness during gradient descent. By quantifying this collaboration between layers using our proposed concept, co-correlation, we demonstrate a monotonically increasing trend in co-correlation, which implies a decreasing trend in adversarial robustness during gradient descent. Additionally, we observe different behaviours between narrow and wide neural networks during gradient descent. We conducted extensive experiments that verified our proposed theorems."
Poster,The Implicit Bias of Heterogeneity towards Invariance: A Study of Multi-Environment Matrix Sensing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93560,"Yang Xu, Yihong Gu, Cong Fang","Models are expected to engage in invariance learning, which involves distinguishing the core relations that remain consistent across varying environments to ensure the predictions are safe, robust and fair. While existing works consider specific algorithms to realize invariance learning, we show that model has the potential to learn invariance through standard training procedures. In other words, this paper studies the implicit bias of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) over heterogeneous data and shows that the implicit bias drives the model learning towards an invariant solution. We call the phenomenon the implicit invariance learning. Specifically, we theoretically investigate the multi-environment low-rank matrix sensing problem where in each environment, the signal comprises (i) a lower-rank invariant part shared across all environments; and (ii) a significantly varying environment-dependent spurious component. The key insight is, through simply employing the large step size large-batch SGD sequentially in each environment without any explicit regularization, the oscillation caused by heterogeneity can provably prevent model learning spurious signals.  The model reaches the invariant solution after certain iterations. In contrast, model learned using pooled SGD over all data would simultaneously learn both the invariant and spurious signals. Overall, we unveil another implicit bias that is a result of the symbiosis between the heterogeneity of data and modern algorithms, which is, to the best of our knowledge, first in the literature."
Poster,The Importance of Being Scalable: Improving the Speed and Accuracy of Neural Network Interatomic Potentials Across Chemical Domains,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94722,"Eric Qu, Aditi Krishnapriyan","Scaling has been a critical factor in improving model performance and generalization across various fields of machine learning.It involves how a model’s performance changes with increases in model size or input data, as well as how efficiently computational resources are utilized to support this growth. Despite successes in scaling other types of machine learning models, the study of scaling in Neural Network Interatomic Potentials (NNIPs) remains limited. NNIPs act as surrogate models for ab initio quantum mechanical calculations, predicting the energy and forces between atoms in molecules and materials based on atomic configurations. The dominant paradigm in this field is to incorporate numerous physical domain constraints into the model, such as symmetry constraints like rotational equivariance. We contend that these increasingly complex domain constraints inhibit the scaling ability of NNIPs, and such strategies are likely to cause model performance to plateau in the long run. In this work, we take an alternative approach and start by systematically studying NNIP scaling properties and strategies. Our findings indicate that scaling the model through attention mechanisms is both efficient and improves model expressivity. These insights motivate us to develop an NNIP architecture designed for scalability: the Efficiently Scaled Attention Interatomic Potential (EScAIP). EScAIP leverages a novel multi-head self-attention formulation within graph neural networks, applying attention at the neighbor-level representations.Implemented with highly-optimized attention GPU kernels, EScAIP achieves substantial gains in efficiency---at least 10x speed up in inference time, 5x less in memory usage---compared to existing NNIP models. EScAIP also achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of datasets including catalysts (OC20 and OC22), molecules (SPICE), and materials (MPTrj). After training EScAIP, we test its ability to learn rotational equivariance by predicting forces on new, unseen atomistic systems before and after rotation. The model's force predictions exactly match the rotated forces,  suggesting that it has precisely learned rotational equivariance.Finally, we emphasize that our approach should be thought of as a philosophy rather than a specific model, representing a proof-of-concept towards developing general-purpose NNIPs that achieve better expressivity through scaling, and continue to scale efficiently with increased computational resources and training data."
Poster,The Importance of Online Data: Understanding Preference Fine-tuning via Coverage,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95849,"Yuda Song, Gokul Swamy, Aarti Singh, J. Bagnell, Wen Sun","Learning from human preference data has emerged as the dominant paradigm for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). The two most common families of techniques -- online reinforcement learning (RL) such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and offline contrastive methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) -- were positioned as equivalent in prior work due to the fact that both have to start from the same offline preference dataset. To further expand our theoretical understanding of the similarities and differences between online and offline techniques for preference fine-tuning, we conduct a rigorous analysis through the lens of *dataset coverage*, a concept that captures how the training data covers the test distribution and is widely used in RL. We prove that a global coverage condition is both necessary and sufficient for offline contrastive methods to converge to the optimal policy, but a weaker partial coverage condition suffices for online RL methods. This separation provides one explanation of why online RL methods can perform better than offline methods, especially when the offline preference data is not diverse enough. Finally, motivated by our preceding theoretical observations, we derive a hybrid preference optimization (HyPO) algorithm that uses offline data for contrastive-based preference optimization and online unlabeled data for KL regularization. Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate that HyPO is more performant than its pure offline counterpart DPO, while still preserving its computation and memory efficiency."
Poster,The iNaturalist Sounds Dataset,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97701,"Mustafa Chasmai, Alexander Shepard, Subhransu Maji, Grant Van Horn","We present the iNaturalist Sounds Dataset (iNatSounds), a collection of 230,000 audio files capturing sounds from over 5,500 species, contributed by more than 27,000 recordists worldwide. The dataset encompasses sounds from birds, mammals, insects, reptiles, and amphibians, with audio and species labels derived from observations submitted to iNaturalist, a global citizen science platform. Each recording in the dataset varies in length and includes a single species annotation. We benchmark multiple backbone architectures, comparing multiclass classification objectives with multilabel objectives. Despite weak labeling, we demonstrate that iNatSounds serves as a useful pretraining resource by benchmarking it on strongly labeled downstream evaluation datasets. The dataset is available as a single, freely accessible archive, promoting accessibility and research in this important domain. We envision models trained on this data powering next-generation public engagement applications, and assisting biologists, ecologists, and land use managers in processing large audio collections, thereby contributing to the understanding of species compositions in diverse soundscapes."
Poster,The Intelligible and Effective Graph Neural Additive Network,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95111,"Maya Bechler-Speicher, Amir Globerson, Ran Gilad-Bachrach","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the predominant approach for learning over graph-structured data.  However, most GNNs operate as black-box models and require post-hoc explanations, which may not suffice in high-stakes scenarios where transparency is crucial.In this paper, we present a GNN that is interpretable by design.  Our model,  Graph Neural Additive Network (GNAN), is a novel extension of the interpretable class of Generalized Additive Models,  and can be visualized and fully understood by humans. GNAN is designed to be fully interpretable, offering both global and local explanations at the feature and graph levels through direct visualization of the model. These visualizations describe exactly how the model uses the relationships between the target variable, the features, and the graph. We demonstrate the intelligibility of GNANs in a series of examples on different tasks and datasets. In addition, we show that the accuracy of GNAN is on par with black-box GNNs, making it suitable for critical applications where transparency is essential, alongside high accuracy."
