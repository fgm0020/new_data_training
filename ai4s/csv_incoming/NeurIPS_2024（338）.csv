Poster,ReMAP: Neural Model Reprogramming with Network Inversion and Retrieval-Augmented Mapping for Adaptive Motion Forecasting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94338,"Sharmita Dey, Sarath Ravindran Nair","Mobility impairment caused by limb loss, aging, stroke, and other movement deficiencies is a significant challenge faced by millions of individuals worldwide. Advanced assistive technologies, such as prostheses and orthoses, have the potential to greatly improve the quality of life for such individuals. A critical component in the design of these technologies is the accurate forecasting of reference joint motion for impaired limbs, which is hindered by the scarcity of joint locomotion data available for these patients. To address this, we propose ReMAP, a novel model repurposing strategy that leverages deep learning's reprogramming property, incorporating network inversion principles and retrieval-augmented mapping. Our approach adapts models originally designed for able-bodied individuals to forecast joint motion in limb-impaired patients without altering model parameters. We demonstrate the efficacy of ReMAP through extensive empirical studies on data from below-knee amputated patients, showcasing significant improvements over traditional transfer learning and fine-tuning methods. These findings have significant implications for advancing assistive technology and mobility for patients with amputations, stroke, or aging."
Poster,ReMI: A Dataset for Reasoning with Multiple Images,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97828,"Mehran Kazemi, Nishanth Dikkala, Ankit Anand, Petar Devic, Ishita Dasgupta, Fangyu Liu, Bahare Fatemi, Pranjal Awasthi, Sreenivas Gollapudi, Dee Guo, Ahmed Qureshi","With the continuous advancement of large language models (LLMs), it is essential to create new benchmarks to evaluate their expanding capabilities and identify areas for improvement. This work focuses on multi-image reasoning, an emerging capability in state-of-the-art LLMs. We introduce ReMI, a dataset designed to assess LLMs' ability to reason with multiple images. This dataset encompasses a diverse range of tasks, spanning various reasoning domains such as math, physics, logic, code, table/chart understanding, and spatial and temporal reasoning. It also covers a broad spectrum of characteristics found in multi-image reasoning scenarios. We have benchmarked several cutting-edge LLMs using ReMI and found a substantial gap between their performance and human-level proficiency. This highlights the challenges in multi-image reasoning and the need for further research. Our analysis also reveals the strengths and weaknesses of different models, shedding light on the types of reasoning that are currently attainable and areas where future models require improvement. We anticipate that ReMI will be a valuable resource for developing and evaluating more sophisticated LLMs capable of handling real-world multi-image understanding tasks."
Poster,Remix-DiT: Mixing Diffusion Transformers for Multi-Expert Denoising,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93189,"Gongfan Fang, Xinyin Ma, Xinchao Wang","Transformer-based diffusion models have achieved significant advancements across a variety of generative tasks. However, producing high-quality outputs typically necessitates large transformer models, which result in substantial training and inference overhead. In this work, we investigate an alternative approach involving multiple experts for denoising, and introduce RemixDiT, a novel method designed to enhance output quality at a low cost. The goal of RemixDiT is to craft N diffusion experts for different denoising timesteps, yet without the need for expensive training of N independent models. To achieve this, RemixDiT employs K basis models (where K < N) and utilizes learnable mixing coefficients to adaptively craft expert models. This design offers two significant advantages: first, although the total model size is increased, the model produced by the mixing operation shares the same architecture as a plain model, making the overall model as efficient as a standard diffusion transformer. Second, the learnable mixing adaptively allocates model capacity across timesteps, thereby effectively improving generation quality. Experiments conducted on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that RemixDiT achieves promising results compared to standard diffusion transformers and other multiple-expert methods."
Poster,ReMoDetect: Reward Models Recognize Aligned LLM's Generations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93548,"Hyunseok Lee, Jihoon Tack, Jinwoo Shin","The remarkable capabilities and easy accessibility of large language models (LLMs) have significantly increased societal risks (e.g., fake news generation), necessitating the development of LLM-generated text (LGT) detection methods for safe usage. However, detecting LGTs is challenging due to the vast number of LLMs, making it impractical to account for each LLM individually; hence, it is crucial to identify the common characteristics shared by these models. In this paper, we draw attention to a common feature of recent powerful LLMs, namely the alignment training, i.e., training LLMs to generate human-preferable texts. Our key finding is that as these aligned LLMs are trained to maximize the human preferences, they generate texts with higher estimated preferences even than human-written texts; thus, such texts are easily detected by using the reward model (i.e., an LLM trained to model human preference distribution). Based on this finding, we propose two training schemes to further improve the detection ability of the reward model, namely (i) continual preference fine-tuning to make reward model prefer aligned LGTs even further and (ii) reward modeling of Human/LLM mixed texts (a rephrased texts from human-written texts using aligned LLMs), which serves as a median preference text corpus between LGTs and human-written texts to learn the decision boundary better. We provide an extensive evaluation by considering six text domains across twelve aligned LLMs, where our method demonstrates state-of-the-art results."
Poster,Remove that Square Root: A New Efficient Scale-Invariant Version of AdaGrad,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96023,"Sayantan Choudhury, Nazarii Tupitsa, Nicolas Loizou, Samuel Horváth, Martin Takac, Eduard Gorbunov","Adaptive methods are extremely popular in machine learning as they make learning rate tuning less expensive. This paper introduces a novel optimization algorithm named KATE, which presents a scale-invariant adaptation of the well-known AdaGrad algorithm. We prove the scale-invariance of KATE for the case of Generalized Linear Models. Moreover, for general smooth non-convex problems, we establish a convergence rate of  $O((\log T)/\sqrt{T})$ for KATE, matching the best-known ones for AdaGrad and Adam. We also compare KATE to other state-of-the-art adaptive algorithms Adam and AdaGrad in numerical experiments with different problems, including complex machine learning tasks like image classification and text classification on real data. The results indicate that KATE consistently outperforms AdaGrad and matches/surpasses the performance of Adam in all considered scenarios."
Poster,ReNO: Enhancing One-step Text-to-Image Models through Reward-based Noise Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95513,"Luca Eyring, Shyamgopal Karthik, Karsten Roth, Alexey Dosovitskiy, Zeynep Akata","Text-to-Image (T2I) models have made significant advancements in recent years, but they still struggle to accurately capture intricate details specified in complex compositional prompts. While fine-tuning T2I models with reward objectives has shown promise, it suffers from ""reward hacking"" and may not generalize well to unseen prompt distributions. In this work, we propose Reward-based Noise Optimization (ReNO), a novel approach that enhances T2I models at inference by optimizing the initial noise based on the signal from one or multiple human preference reward models. Remarkably, solving this optimization problem with gradient ascent for 50 iterations yields impressive results on four different one-step models across two competitive benchmarks, T2I-CompBench and GenEval. Within a computational budget of 20-50 seconds, ReNO-enhanced one-step models consistently surpass the performance of all current open-source Text-to-Image models. Extensive user studies demonstrate that our model is preferred nearly twice as often compared to the popular SDXL model and is on par with the proprietary Stable Diffusion 3 with 8B parameters. Moreover, given the same computational resources, a ReNO-optimized one-step model outperforms widely-used open-source models such as SDXL and PixArt-alpha, highlighting the efficiency and effectiveness of ReNO in enhancing T2I model performance at inference time."
Poster,Renovating Names in Open-Vocabulary Segmentation Benchmarks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94935,"Haiwen Huang, Songyou Peng, Dan Zhang, Andreas Geiger","Names are essential to both human cognition and vision-language models. Open-vocabulary models utilize class names as text prompts to generalize to categories unseen during training. However, the precision of these names is often overlooked in existing datasets. In this paper, we address this underexplored problem by presenting a framework for ""renovating"" names in open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks (RENOVATE). Our framework features a renaming model that enhances the quality of names for each visual segment. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our renovated names help train stronger open-vocabulary models with up to 15% relative improvement and significantly enhance training efficiency with improved data quality. We also show that our renovated names improve evaluation by better measuring misclassification and enabling fine-grained model analysis. We provide our code and relabelings for several popular segmentation datasets to the research community on our project page: https://andrehuang.github.io/renovate."
Poster,[Re] On the Reproducibility of Post-Hoc Concept Bottleneck Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/99334,"Gregory Hok Tjoan Go, Diego Canez, Nesta Midavaine, Satchit Chatterji, Ioana Simion","To obtain state-of-the-art performance, many deeper artificial intelligence models sacrifice human explainability in their decision-making. One solution proposed for achieving top performance and retaining explainability is the Post-Hoc Concept Bottleneck Model (PCBM) (Yuksekgonul et al., 2023), which can convert the embeddings of any deep neural network into a set of human-interpretable concept weights. In this work, we reproduce and expand upon the findings of Yuksekgonul et al. (2023). Our results show that while most of the authors’ claims and results hold, some of the results they obtained could not be sufficiently replicated. Specifically, the claims relating to PCBM performance preservation and its non-requirement of labeled concept datasets were generally reproduced, whereas the one claiming its model editing capabilities was not. Beyond these results, our contributions to their work include evidence that PCBMs may work for audio classification problems, verification of the interpretability of their methods, and updates to their code for missing implementations. The code for our implementations can be found at https://github.com/dgcnz/FACT."
Poster,Reparameterization invariance in approximate Bayesian inference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96837,"Hrittik Roy, Marco Miani, Carl Henrik Ek, Philipp Hennig, Marvin Pförtner, Lukas Tatzel, Søren Hauberg","Current approximate posteriors in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) exhibit a crucial limitation: they fail to maintain invariance under reparameterization, i.e. BNNs assign different posterior densities to different parametrizations of identical functions. This creates a fundamental flaw in the application of Bayesian principles as it breaks the correspondence between uncertainty over the parameters with uncertainty over the parametrized function. In this paper, we investigate this issue in the context of the increasingly popular linearized Laplace approximation. Specifically, it has been observed that linearized predictives alleviate the common underfitting problems of the Laplace approximation. We develop a new geometric view of reparametrizations from which we explain the success of linearization. Moreover, we demonstrate that these reparameterization invariance properties can be extended to the original neural network predictive using a Riemannian diffusion process giving a straightforward algorithm for approximate posterior sampling, which empirically improves posterior fit."
Poster,Reparameterized Multi-Resolution Convolutions for Long Sequence Modelling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95141,"Jake Cunningham, Giorgio Giannone, Mingtian Zhang, Marc Deisenroth","Global convolutions have shown increasing promise as powerful general-purpose sequence models. However, training long convolutions is challenging, and kernel parameterizations must be able to learn long-range dependencies without overfitting. This work introduces reparameterized multi-resolution convolutions ($\texttt{MRConv}$), a novel approach to parameterizing global convolutional kernels for long-sequence modeling. By leveraging multi-resolution convolutions, incorporating structural reparameterization and introducing learnable kernel decay, $\texttt{MRConv}$ learns expressive long-range kernels that perform well across various data modalities. Our experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the Long Range Arena, Sequential CIFAR, and Speech Commands tasks among convolution models and linear-time transformers. Moreover, we report improved performance on ImageNet classification by replacing 2D convolutions with 1D $\texttt{MRConv}$ layers."
