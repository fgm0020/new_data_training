Poster,Bayes-optimal learning of an extensive-width neural network from quadratically many samples,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95194,"Antoine Maillard, Emanuele Troiani, Simon Martin, Florent Krzakala, Lenka Zdeborová","We consider the problem of learning a target function corresponding to a singlehidden layer neural network, with a quadratic activation function after the first layer,and random weights. We consider the asymptotic limit where the input dimensionand the network width are proportionally large. Recent work [Cui et al., 2023]established that linear regression provides Bayes-optimal test error to learn sucha function when the number of available samples is only linear in the dimension.That work stressed the open challenge of theoretically analyzing the optimal testerror in the more interesting regime where the number of samples is quadratic inthe dimension. In this paper, we solve this challenge for quadratic activations andderive a closed-form expression for the Bayes-optimal test error. We also provide analgorithm, that we call GAMP-RIE, which combines approximate message passingwith rotationally invariant matrix denoising, and that asymptotically achieves theoptimal performance. Technically, our result is enabled by establishing a linkwith recent works on optimal denoising of extensive-rank matrices and on theellipsoid fitting problem. We further show empirically that, in the absence ofnoise, randomly-initialized gradient descent seems to sample the space of weights,leading to zero training loss, and averaging over initialization leads to a test errorequal to the Bayes-optimal one."
Poster,B-cosification: Transforming Deep Neural Networks to be Inherently Interpretable,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95051,"Shreyash Arya, Sukrut Rao, Moritz Böhle, Bernt Schiele","B-cos Networks have been shown to be effective for obtaining highly human interpretable explanations of model decisions by architecturally enforcing stronger alignment between inputs and weight. B-cos variants of convolutional networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), which primarily replace linear layers with B-cos transformations, perform competitively to their respective standard variants while also yielding explanations that are faithful by design. However, it has so far been necessary to train these models from scratch, which is increasingly infeasible in the era of large, pre-trained foundation models. In this work, inspired by the architectural similarities in standard DNNs and B-cos networks, we propose ‘B-cosification’, a novel approach to transform existing pre-trained models to become inherently interpretable. We perform a thorough study of design choices to perform this conversion, both for convolutional neural networks and vision transformers. We find that B-cosification can yield models that are on par with B-cos models trained from scratch in terms of interpretability, while often outperforming them in terms of classification performance at a fraction of the training cost. Subsequently, we apply B-cosification to a pretrained CLIP model, and show that, even with limited data and compute cost, we obtain a B-cosified version that is highly interpretable and competitive on zero shot performance across a variety of datasets. We release ourcode and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/shrebox/B-cosification."
Poster,BEACON: Benchmark for Comprehensive RNA Tasks and Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97501,"Yuchen Ren, Zhiyuan Chen, Lifeng Qiao, Hongtai Jing, Yuchen Cai, Sheng Xu, Peng Ye, Xinzhu Ma, Siqi Sun, Hongliang Yan, Dong Yuan, Wanli Ouyang, Xihui Liu","RNA plays a pivotal role in translating genetic instructions into functional outcomes, underscoring its importance in biological processes and disease mechanisms. Despite the emergence of numerous deep learning approaches for RNA, particularly universal RNA language models, there remains a significant lack of standardized benchmarks to assess the effectiveness of these methods. In this study, we introduce the first comprehensive RNA benchmark BEACON **BE**nchm**A**rk for  **CO**mprehensive R**N**A Task and Language Models).First, BEACON comprises 13 distinct tasks derived from extensive previous work covering structural analysis, functional studies, and engineering applications, enabling a comprehensive assessment of the performance of methods on various RNA understanding tasks. Second, we examine a range of models, including traditional approaches like CNNs, as well as advanced RNA foundation models based on language models, offering valuable insights into the task-specific performances of these models. Third, we investigate the vital RNA language model components from the tokenizer and positional encoding aspects. Notably, our findings emphasize the superiority of single nucleotide tokenization and the effectiveness of Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi) over traditional positional encoding methods. Based on these insights, a simple yet strong baseline called BEACON-B is proposed, which can achieve outstanding performance with limited data and computational resources. The datasets and source code of our benchmark are available at https://github.com/terry-r123/RNABenchmark."
Poster,"BeanCounter: A low-toxicity, large-scale, and open dataset of business-oriented text",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97771,"Siyan Wang, Bradford Levy","Many of the recent breakthroughs in language modeling have resulted from scaling effectively the same model architecture to larger datasets. In this vein, recent work has highlighted performance gains from increasing training dataset size and quality, suggesting a need for novel sources of large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce BeanCounter, a public dataset consisting of more than 159B tokens extracted from businesses' disclosures. We show that this data is indeed novel: less than 0.1% of BeanCounter appears in Common Crawl-based datasets and it is an order of magnitude larger than datasets relying on similar sources. Given the data's provenance, we hypothesize that BeanCounter is comparatively more factual and less toxic than web-based datasets. Exploring this hypothesis, we find that many demographic identities occur with similar prevalence in BeanCounter but with significantly less toxic context relative to other datasets. To demonstrate the utility of BeanCounter, we evaluate and compare two LLMs continually pre-trained on BeanCounter with their base models. We find an 18-33% reduction in toxic generation and improved performance within the finance domain for the continually pretrained models. Collectively, our work suggests that BeanCounter is a novel source of low-toxicity and high-quality domain-specific data with sufficient scale to train multi-billion parameter LLMs."
Poster,Beating Adversarial Low-Rank MDPs with Unknown Transition and Bandit Feedback,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96516,"Haolin Liu, Zak Mhammedi, Chen-Yu Wei, Julian Zimmert","We consider regret minimization in low-rank MDPs with fixed transition and adversarial losses. Previous work has investigated this problem under either full-information loss feedback with unknown transitions (Zhao et al., 2024), or bandit loss feedback with known transitions (Foster et al., 2022). First, we improve the $poly(d, A, H)T^{5/6}$ regret bound of Zhao et al. (2024) to $poly(d, A, H)T^{2/3}$ for the full-information unknown transition setting, where $d$ is the rank of the transitions, $A$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the horizon length, and $T$ is the number of episodes. Next, we initiate the study on the setting with bandit loss feedback and unknown transitions. Assuming that the loss has a linear structure, we propose both model-based and model-free algorithms achieving $poly(d, A, H)T^{2/3}$ regret, though they are computationally inefficient. We also propose oracle-efficient model-free algorithms with $poly(d, A, H)T^{4/5}$ regret. We show that the linear structure is necessary for the bandit case—without structure on the reward function, the regret has to scale polynomially with the number of states. This is contrary to the full-information case (Zhao et al., 2024), where the regret can be independent of the number of states even for unstructured reward functions."
Poster,BECAUSE: Bilinear Causal Representation for Generalizable Offline Model-based Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96645,"Haohong Lin, Wenhao Ding, Jian Chen, Laixi Shi, Jiacheng Zhu, Bo Li, DING ZHAO","Offline model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) enhances data efficiency by utilizing pre-collected datasets to learn models and policies, especially in scenarios where exploration is costly or infeasible. Nevertheless, its performance often suffers from the objective mismatch between model and policy learning, resulting in inferior performance despite accurate model predictions. This paper first identifies the primary source of this mismatch comes from the underlying confounders present in offline data for MBRL. Subsequently, we introduce **B**ilin**E**ar **CAUS**al r**E**presentation (BECAUSE), an algorithm to capture causal representation for both states and actions to reduce the influence of the distribution shift, thus mitigating the objective mismatch problem. Comprehensive evaluations on 18 tasks that vary in data quality and environment context demonstrate the superior performance of BECAUSE over existing offline RL algorithms. We show the generalizability and robustness of BECAUSE under fewer samples or larger numbers of confounders. Additionally, we offer theoretical analysis of BECAUSE to prove its error bound and sample efficiency when integrating causal representation into offline MBRL.

Poster,Be Confident in What You Know: Bayesian Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning of Vision Foundation Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93801,"Deep Pandey, Spandan Pyakurel, Qi Yu","Large transformer-based foundation models have been commonly used as pre-trained models that can be adapted to different challenging datasets and settings with state-of-the-art generalization performance. Parameter efficient fine-tuning ($\texttt{PEFT}$) provides promising generalization performance in adaptation while incurring minimum computational overhead. However, adaptation of these foundation models through $\texttt{PEFT}$ leads to accurate but severely underconfident models, especially in few-shot learning settings. Moreover, the adapted models lack accurate fine-grained uncertainty quantification capabilities limiting their broader applicability in critical domains. To fill out this critical gap, we develop a novel lightweight {Bayesian Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning} (referred to as $\texttt{Bayesian-PEFT}$) framework for large transformer-based foundation models. The framework integrates state-of-the-art $\texttt{PEFT}$ techniques with two Bayesian components to address the under-confidence issue while ensuring reliable prediction under challenging few-shot settings. The first component performs base rate adjustment to strengthen the prior belief corresponding to the knowledge gained through pre-training, making the model more confident in its predictions; the second component builds an evidential ensemble that leverages belief regularization to ensure diversity among different ensemble components.Our thorough theoretical analysis justifies that the  Bayesian components can ensure reliable and accurate few-shot adaptations with well-calibrated uncertainty quantification. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, few-shot learning scenarios, and multiple $\texttt{PEFT}$ techniques demonstrate the outstanding prediction and calibration performance by $\texttt{Bayesian-PEFT}$."
Poster,BehaviorGPT: Smart Agent Simulation for Autonomous Driving with Next-Patch Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95903,"Zikang Zhou, HU Haibo, Xinhong Chen, Jianping Wang, Nan Guan, Kui Wu, Yung-Hui Li, Yu-Kai Huang, Chun Jason Xue","Simulating realistic behaviors of traffic agents is pivotal for efficiently validating the safety of autonomous driving systems. Existing data-driven simulators primarily use an encoder-decoder architecture to encode the historical trajectories before decoding the future. However, the heterogeneity between encoders and decoders complicates the models, and the manual separation of historical and future trajectories leads to low data utilization. Given these limitations, we propose BehaviorGPT, a homogeneous and fully autoregressive Transformer designed to simulate the sequential behavior of multiple agents. Crucially, our approach discards the traditional separation between ""history"" and ""future"" by modeling each time step as the ""current"" one for motion generation, leading to a simpler, more parameter- and data-efficient agent simulator. We further introduce the Next-Patch Prediction Paradigm (NP3) to mitigate the negative effects of autoregressive modeling, in which models are trained to reason at the patch level of trajectories and capture long-range spatial-temporal interactions. Despite having merely 3M model parameters, BehaviorGPT won first place in the 2024 Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge with a realism score of 0.7473 and a minADE score of 1.4147, demonstrating its exceptional performance in traffic agent simulation."
Poster,Belief-State Query Policies for User-Aligned POMDPs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94035,"Daniel Bramblett, Siddharth Srivastava","Planning in real-world settings often entails addressing partial observability while aligning with users' requirements. We present a novel framework for expressing users' constraints and preferences about agent behavior in a partially observable setting using parameterized belief-state query (BSQ) policies in the setting of goal-oriented partially observable Markov decision processes (gPOMDPs). We present the first formal analysis of such constraints and prove that while the expected cost function of a parameterized BSQ policy w.r.t its parameters is not convex, it is piecewise constant and yields an implicit discrete parameter search space that is finite for finite horizons. This theoretical result leads to novel algorithms that optimize gPOMDP agent behavior with guaranteed user alignment. Analysis proves that our algorithms converge to the optimal user-aligned behavior in the limit. Empirical results show that parameterized BSQ policies provide a computationally feasible approach for user-aligned planning in partially observable settings."
Poster,"Be like a Goldfish, Don't Memorize! Mitigating Memorization in Generative LLMs",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96066,"Abhimanyu Hans, John Kirchenbauer, Yuxin Wen, Neel Jain, Hamid Kazemi, Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Gowthami Somepalli, Jonas Geiping, Abhinav Bhatele, Tom Goldstein","Large language models can memorize and repeat their training data, causing privacy and copyright risks. To mitigate memorization, we introduce a subtle modification to the next-token training objective that we call the goldfish loss. During training, a randomly sampled subsets of tokens are excluded from the loss computation. These dropped tokens are not memorized by the model, which prevents verbatim reproduction of a complete chain of tokens from the training set. We run extensive experiments training billion-scale LLaMA-2 models, both pre-trained and trained from scratch, and demonstrate significant reductions in extractable memorization with little to no impact on downstream benchmarks._Code and checkpoints: https://github.com/ahans30/goldfish-loss_"
