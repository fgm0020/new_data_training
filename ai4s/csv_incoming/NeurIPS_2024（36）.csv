Poster,AsEP: Benchmarking Deep Learning Methods for Antibody-specific Epitope Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97702,"ChuNan Liu, Lilian Denzler, Yihong Chen, Andrew Martin, Brooks Paige","Epitope identification is vital for antibody design yet challenging due to the inherent variability in antibodies. While many deep learning methods have been developed for general protein binding site prediction tasks, whether they work for epitope prediction remains an understudied research question. The challenge is also heightened by the lack of a consistent evaluation pipeline with sufficient dataset size and epitope diversity. We introduce a filtered antibody-antigen complex structure dataset, AsEP (Antibody-specific Epitope Prediction). AsEP is the largest of its kind and provides clustered epitope groups, allowing the community to develop and test novel epitope prediction methods and evaluate their generalisability. AsEP comes with an easy-to-use interface in Python and pre-built graph representations of each antibody-antigen complex while also supporting customizable embedding methods. Using this new dataset, we benchmark several representative general protein-binding site prediction methods and find that their performances fall short of expectations for epitope prediction. To address this, we propose a novel method, WALLE, which leverages both unstructured modeling from protein language models and structural modeling from graph neural networks. WALLE demonstrate up to 3-10X performance improvement over the baseline methods. Our empirical findings suggest that epitope prediction benefits from combining sequential features provided by language models with geometrical information from graph representations. This provides a guideline for future epitope prediction method design. In addition, we reformulate the task as bipartite link prediction, allowing convenient model performance attribution and interpretability. We open source our data and code at https://github.com/biochunan/AsEP-dataset."
Poster,A Siamese Transformer with Hierarchical Refinement for Lane Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96059,"Zinan Lv, Dong Han, Wenzhe Wang, Danny Z Chen","Lane detection is an important yet challenging task in autonomous driving systems. Existing lane detection methods mainly rely on finer-scale information to identify key points of lane lines. Since local information in realistic road environments is frequently obscured by other vehicles or affected by poor outdoor lighting conditions, these methods struggle with the regression of such key points. In this paper, we propose a novel Siamese Transformer with hierarchical refinement for lane detection to improve the detection accuracy in complex road environments. Specifically, we propose a high-to-low hierarchical refinement Transformer structure, called LAne TRansformer (LATR), to refine the key points of lane lines, which integrates global semantics information and finer-scale features. Moreover, exploiting the thin and long characteristics of lane lines, we propose a novel Curve-IoU loss to supervise the fit of lane lines. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of lane detection demonstrate that our proposed new method achieves state-of-the-art results with high accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our method achieves improved F1 scores on the OpenLane dataset, surpassing the current best-performing method by 5.0 points."
Poster,A Simple and Adaptive Learning Rate for FTRL in Online Learning with Minimax Regret of $\Theta(T^{2/3})$ and its Application to Best-of-Both-Worlds,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94746,"Taira Tsuchiya, Shinji Ito","Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) is a powerful framework for various online learning problems. By designing its regularizer and learning rate to be adaptive to past observations, FTRL is known to work adaptively to various properties of an underlying environment. However, most existing adaptive learning rates are for online learning problems with a minimax regret of $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ for the number of rounds $T$, and there are only a few studies on adaptive learning rates for problems with a minimax regret of $\Theta(T^{2/3})$, which include several important problems dealing with indirect feedback. To address this limitation, we establish a new adaptive learning rate framework for problems with a minimax regret of $\Theta(T^{2/3})$. Our learning rate is designed by matching the stability, penalty, and bias terms that naturally appear in regret upper bounds for problems with a minimax regret of $\Theta(T^{2/3})$. As applications of this framework, we consider three major problems with a minimax regret of $\Theta(T^{2/3})$: partial monitoring, graph bandits, and multi-armed bandits with paid observations. We show that FTRL with our learning rate and the Tsallis entropy regularizer improves existing Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) regret upper bounds, which achieve simultaneous optimality in the stochastic and adversarial regimes. The resulting learning rate is surprisingly simple compared to the existing learning rates for BOBW algorithms for problems with a minimax regret of $\Theta(T^{2/3})$."
Poster,A Simple and Optimal Approach for Universal Online Learning with Gradient Variations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93026,"Yu-Hu Yan, Peng Zhao, Zhi-Hua Zhou","We investigate the problem of universal online learning with gradient-variation regret. Universal online learning aims to achieve regret guarantees without prior knowledge of the curvature of the online functions. Moreover, we study the problem-dependent gradient-variation regret as it plays a crucial role in bridging stochastic and adversarial optimization as well as game theory. In this work, we design a universal approach with the *optimal* gradient-variation regret simultaneously for strongly convex, exp-concave, and convex functions, thus addressing an open problem highlighted by [Yan et al. [2023]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=AA1xrgAP5z). Our approach is *simple* since it is algorithmically efficient-to-implement with a two-layer online ensemble structure and only $1$ gradient query per round, and theoretically easy-to-analyze with a novel and alternative analysis to the gradient-variation regret. Concretely, previous works on gradient variations require controlling the algorithmic stability, which is challenging and leads to sub-optimal regret and less efficient algorithm design. Our analysis overcomes this issue by using a Bregman divergence negative term from linearization and a useful smoothness property."
Poster,A Simple Framework for Generalization in Visual RL under Dynamic Scene Perturbations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96947,"Wonil Song, Hyesong Choi, Kwanghoon Sohn, Dongbo Min","In the rapidly evolving domain of vision-based deep reinforcement learning (RL), a pivotal challenge is to achieve generalization capability to dynamic environmental changes reflected in visual observations.Our work delves into the intricacies of this problem, identifying two key issues that appear in previous approaches for visual RL generalization: (i) imbalanced saliency and (ii) observational overfitting.Imbalanced saliency is a phenomenon where an RL agent disproportionately identifies salient features across consecutive frames in a frame stack. Observational overfitting occurs when the agent focuses on certain background regions rather than task-relevant objects.To address these challenges, we present a simple yet effective framework for generalization in visual RL (SimGRL) under dynamic scene perturbations.First, to mitigate the imbalanced saliency problem, we introduce an architectural modification to the image encoder to stack frames at the feature level rather than the image level.Simultaneously, to alleviate the observational overfitting problem, we propose a novel technique called shifted random overlay augmentation, which is specifically designed to learn robust representations capable of effectively handling dynamic visual scenes.Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalization capability of SimGRL, achieving state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks including the DeepMind Control Suite."
Poster,A Simple Image Segmentation Framework via In-Context Examples,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94242,"Yang Liu, Chenchen Jing, Hengtao Li, Muzhi Zhu, Hao Chen, Xinlong Wang, Chunhua Shen","Recently, there have been explorations of generalist segmentation models that can effectively tackle a variety of image segmentation tasks within a unified in-context learning framework. However, these methods still struggle with task ambiguity in in-context segmentation, as not all in-context examples can accurately convey the task information. In order to address this issue, we present SINE, a simple image $\textbf{S}$egmentation framework utilizing $\textbf{in}$-context $\textbf{e}$xamples. Our approach leverages a Transformer encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder provides high-quality image representations, and the decoder is designed to yield multiple task-specific output masks to eliminate task ambiguity effectively. Specifically, we introduce an In-context Interaction module to complement in-context information and produce correlations between the target image and the in-context example and a Matching Transformer that uses fixed matching and a Hungarian algorithm to eliminate differences between different tasks. In addition, we have further perfected the current evaluation system for in-context image segmentation, aiming to facilitate a holistic appraisal of these models. Experiments on various segmentation tasks show the effectiveness of the proposed method."
Poster,A Simple Remedy for Dataset Bias via Self-Influence: A Mislabeled Sample Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94634,"Yeonsung Jung, Jaeyun Song, June Yong Yang, Jin-Hwa Kim, Sung-Yub Kim, Eunho Yang","Learning generalized models from biased data is an important undertaking toward fairness in deep learning. To address this issue, recent studies attempt to identify and leverage bias-conflicting samples free from spurious correlations without prior knowledge of bias or an unbiased set. However, spurious correlation remains an ongoing challenge, primarily due to the difficulty in correctly detecting these samples. In this paper, inspired by the similarities between mislabeled samples and bias-conflicting samples, we approach this challenge from a novel perspective of mislabeled sample detection. Specifically, we delve into Influence Function, one of the standard methods for mislabeled sample detection, for identifying bias-conflicting samples and propose a simple yet effective remedy for biased models by leveraging them. Through comprehensive analysis and experiments on diverse datasets, we demonstrate that our new perspective can boost the precision of detection and rectify biased models effectively. Furthermore, our approach is complementary to existing methods, showing performance improvement even when applied to models that have already undergone recent debiasing techniques."
Poster,A Simple yet Scalable Granger Causal Structural Learning Approach for Topological Event Sequences,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93760,"Mingjia Li, Shuo Liu, Hong Qian, Aimin Zhou","In modern telecommunication networks, faults manifest as alarms, generating thousands of events daily. Network operators need an efficient method to identify the root causes of these alarms to mitigate potential losses. This task is challenging due to the increasing scale of telecommunication networks and the interconnected nature of devices, where one fault can trigger a cascade of alarms across multiple devices within a topological network. Recent years have seen a growing focus on causal approaches to addressing this problem, emphasizing the importance of learning a Granger causal graph from topological event sequences. Such causal graphs delineate the relations among alarms and can significantly aid engineers in identifying and rectifying faults. However, existing methods either ignore the topological relationships among devices or suffer from relatively low scalability and efficiency, failing to deliver high-quality responses in a timely manner. To this end, this paper proposes $S^2GCSL$, a simple yet scalable Granger causal structural learning approach for topological event sequences. $S^2GCSL$ utilizes a linear kernel to model activation interactions among various event types within a topological network, and employs gradient descent to efficiently optimize the likelihood function. Notably, it can seamlessly incorporate expert knowledge as constraints within the optimization process, which enhances the interpretability of the outcomes. Extensive experimental results on both large-scale synthetic and real-world problems verify the scalability and efficacy of $S^2GCSL$."
Poster,A Simple yet Universal Framework for Depth Completion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94721,"Jin-Hwi Park, Hae-Gon Jeon","Consistent depth estimation across diverse scenes and sensors is a crucial challenge in computer vision, especially when deploying machine learning models in the real world. Traditional methods depend heavily on extensive pixel-wise labeled data, which is costly and labor-intensive to acquire, and frequently have difficulty in scale issues on various depth sensors. In response, we define Universal Depth Completion (UniDC) problem. We also present a baseline architecture, a simple yet effective approach tailored to estimate scene depth across a wide range of sensors and environments using minimal labeled data. Our approach addresses two primary challenges: generalizable knowledge of unseen scene configurations and strong adaptation to arbitrary depth sensors with various specifications. To enhance versatility in the wild, we utilize a foundation model for monocular depth estimation that provides a comprehensive understanding of 3D structures in scenes. Additionally, for fast adaptation to off-the-shelf sensors, we generate a pixel-wise affinity map based on the knowledge from the foundation model. We then adjust depth information from arbitrary sensors to the monocular depth along with the constructed affinity. Furthermore, to boost up both the adaptability and generality, we embed the learned features into hyperbolic space, which builds implicit hierarchical structures of 3D data from fewer examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed method's superior generalization capabilities for UniDC problem over state-of-the-art depth completion.

Poster,A Simulation Benchmark for Autonomous Racing with Large-Scale Human Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97499,"Adrian Remonda, Nicklas Hansen, Ayoub Raji, Nicola Musiu, Marko Bertogna, Eduardo Veas, Xiaolong Wang","Despite the availability of international prize-money competitions, scaled vehicles, and simulation environments, research on autonomous racing and the control of sports cars operating close to the limit of handling has been limited by the high costs of vehicle acquisition and management, as well as the limited physics accuracy of open-source simulators.

Our contributions include the development of this simulation platform, several state-of-the-art algorithms tailored to the racing environment, and a comprehensive dataset collected from human drivers. Additionally, we evaluate algorithms in the offline RL setting.
