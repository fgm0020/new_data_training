Poster,ImOV3D: Learning Open Vocabulary Point  Clouds 3D Object Detection from Only 2D Images,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95191,"Timing Yang, Yuanliang Ju, Li Yi","Open-vocabulary 3D object detection (OV-3Det) aims to generalize beyond the limited number of base categories labeled during the training phase. The biggest bottleneck is the scarcity of annotated 3D data, whereas 2D image datasets are abundant and richly annotated. Consequently, it is intuitive to leverage the wealth of annotations in 2D images to alleviate the inherent data scarcity in OV-3Det. In this paper, we push the task setup to its limits by exploring the potential of using solely 2D images to learn OV-3Det. The major challenges for this setup is the modality gap between training images and testing point clouds, which prevents effective integration of 2D knowledge into OV-3Det. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework ImOV3D to leverage pseudo multimodal representation containing both images and point clouds (PC) to close the modality gap. The key of ImOV3D lies in flexible modality conversion where 2D images can be lifted into 3D using monocular depth estimation and can also be derived from 3D scenes through rendering. This allows unifying both training images and testing point clouds into a common image-PC representation, encompassing a wealth of 2D semantic information and also incorporating the depth and structural characteristics of 3D spatial data. We carefully conduct such conversion to minimize the domain gap between training and test cases. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, SUNRGBD and ScanNet, show that ImOV3D significantly outperforms existing methods, even in the absence of ground truth 3D training data. With the inclusion of a minimal amount of real 3D data for fine-tuning, the performance also significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art.

Poster,IMPACT: A Large-scale Integrated Multimodal Patent Analysis and Creation Dataset for Design Patents,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97529,"Homaira Huda Shomee, Zhu Wang, Sathya Ravi, Sourav Medya","In this paper, we introduce IMPACT (Integrated Multimodal Patent Analysis and Creation Dataset for Design Patents), a large-scale multimodal patent dataset with detailed captions for design patent figures. Our dataset includes half a million design patents comprising 3.61 million figures along with captions from patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) over a 16-year period from 2007 to 2022. We incorporate the metadata of each patent application with elaborate captions that are coherent with multiple viewpoints of designs.  Even though patents themselves contain a variety of design figures, titles, and descriptions of viewpoints, we find that they lack detailed descriptions that are necessary to perform multimodal tasks such as classification and retrieval. IMPACT closes this gap thereby providing researchers with necessary ingredients to instantiate a variety of multimodal tasks. Our dataset has a huge potential for novel design inspiration and can be used with advanced computer vision models in tandem. We perform preliminary evaluations on the dataset on the popular patent analysis tasks such as classification and retrieval. Our results indicate that integrating images with generated captions significantly improves the performance of different models on the corresponding tasks. Given that design patents offer various benefits for modeling novel tasks, we propose two standard computer vision tasks that have not been investigated in analyzing patents as future directions using IMPACT as a benchmark viz., 3D Image Construction and Visual Question Answering (VQA). To facilitate research in these directions, we make our IMPACT dataset and the code/models used in this work publicly available at https://github.com/AI4Patents/IMPACT."
Poster,Implicit Bias of Mirror Flow on Separable Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93131,"Scott Pesme, Radu-Alexandru Dragomir, Nicolas Flammarion","We examine the continuous-time counterpart of mirror descent, namely mirror flow, on classification problems which are linearly separable. Such problems are minimised ‘at infinity’ and have many possible solutions; we study which solution is preferred by the algorithm depending on the mirror potential. For exponential tailed losses and under mild assumptions on the potential, we show that the iterates converge in direction towards a $\phi_\infty$-maximum margin classifier. The function $\phi_\infty$ is the horizon function of the mirror potential and characterises its shape ‘at infinity’. When the potential is separable, a simple formula allows to compute this function. We analyse several examples of potentials and provide numerical experiments highlighting our results."
Poster,Implicit Curriculum in Procgen Made Explicit,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93682,"Zhenxiong Tan, Kaixin Wang, Xinchao Wang","Procedurally generated environments such as Procgen Benchmark provide a testbed for evaluating the agent's ability to robustly learn a relevant skill, by situating the agent in ever-changing levels. The diverse levels associated with varying contexts are naturally connected to curriculum learning. Existing works mainly focus on arranging the levels to explicitly form a curriculum. In this work, we take a close look at the learning process itself under the multi-level training in Procgen. Interestingly, the learning process exhibits a gradual shift from easy contexts to hard contexts, suggesting an implicit curriculum in multi-level training. Our analysis is made possible through C-Procgen, a benchmark we build upon Procgen that enables explicit control of the contexts. We believe our findings will foster a deeper understanding of learning in diverse contexts, and our benchmark will benefit future research in curriculum reinforcement learning."
Poster,Implicitly Guided Design with PropEn: Match your Data to Follow the Gradient,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94325,"Nataša Tagasovska, Vladimir Gligorijevic, Kyunghyun Cho, Andreas Loukas","Across scientific domains, generating new models or optimizing existing ones while meeting specific criteria is crucial. Traditional machine learning frameworks for guided design use a generative model and a surrogate model (discriminator), requiring large datasets. However, real-world scientific applications often have limited data and complex landscapes, making data-hungry models inefficient or impractical. We propose a new framework, PropEn, inspired by ``matching'', which enables implicit guidance without training a discriminator. By matching each sample with a similar one that has a better property value, we create a larger training dataset that inherently indicates the direction of improvement. Matching, combined with an encoder-decoder architecture, forms a domain-agnostic generative framework for property enhancement. We show that training with a matched dataset approximates the gradient of the property of interest while remaining within the data distribution, allowing efficient design optimization. Extensive evaluations in toy problems and scientific applications, such as therapeutic protein design and airfoil optimization, demonstrate PropEn's advantages over common baselines. Notably, the protein design results are validated with wet lab experiments, confirming the competitiveness and effectiveness of our approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/prescient-design/propen."
Poster,Implicit Multimodal Alignment: On the Generalization of Frozen LLMs to Multimodal Inputs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96328,"Mustafa Shukor, Matthieu Cord","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on multimodal tasks, without any multimodal finetuning. They are the de facto building block for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), yet, we still lack a proper understanding of their success. In this work, we expose frozen LLMs to image, video, audio and text inputs and analyse their internal representation with the attempt to understand their generalization beyond textual inputs. Our work provides the following **findings.** Perceptual tokens (1) are easily distinguishable from textual ones inside LLMs, with significantly different representations (e.g. live in different narrow cones), and complete translation to textual tokens does not exists. Yet, (2) both perceptual and textual tokens activate similar LLM weights. Despite their differences, (3) perceptual tokens are implicitly aligned to textual tokens inside LLMs, we call this the implicit multimodal alignment effect (IMA), and argue that this is linked to architectural design, helping LLMs to generalize. This provide more evidence to believe that the generalization of LLMs to multimodal inputs is mainly due to their architecture.  These findings lead to several **implications.** This work provides several implications. (1) We find a positive correlation between the implicit alignment score and the task performance, suggesting that this could act as a proxy metric for model evaluation and selection. (2) A negative correlation exists regarding hallucinations (e.g. describing non-existing objects in images), revealing that this problem is mainly due to misalignment between the internal perceptual and textual representations. (3) Perceptual tokens change slightly throughout the model, thus, we propose different approaches to skip computations (e.g. in FFN layers), and significantly reduce the inference cost. (4) Due to the slowly changing embeddings across layers, and the high overlap between textual and multimodal activated weights, we compress LLMs by keeping only 1 subnetwork (called alpha-SubNet) that works well across a wide range of multimodal tasks. The code is available here: https://github.com/mshukor/ima-lmms."
Poster,Implicit Optimization Bias of Next-token Prediction in Linear Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93083,Christos Thrampoulidis,"We initiate an investigation into the optimization properties of next-token prediction (NTP), the dominant training paradigm for modern language models. Specifically, we study the structural properties of the solutions selected by gradient-based optimizers among the many possible minimizers of the NTP objective. By framing NTP as cross-entropy minimization  across \emph{distinct} contexts, each tied with a \emph{sparse}  conditional probability distribution across a finite vocabulary of tokens, we introduce ``NTP-separability conditions'' that enable reaching the data-entropy lower bound. With this setup, and focusing on linear models with fixed context embeddings, we characterize the optimization bias of gradient descent (GD): Within the data subspace defined by the sparsity patterns of distinct contexts, GD selects parameters that equate the logits' differences of in-support tokens to their log-odds. In the orthogonal subspace, the GD parameters diverge in norm and select the direction that maximizes a margin specific to NTP. These findings extend previous research on implicit bias in one-hot classification to the NTP setting, highlighting key differences and prompting further research into the optimization and generalization properties of NTP, irrespective of the specific architecture used to generate the context embeddings."
Poster,Implicit Regularization of Decentralized Gradient Descent for Sparse Regression,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95493,"Tongle Wu, Ying Sun","We consider learning a sparse model from linear measurements taken by a network of agents. Different from existing decentralized methods designed based on the LASSO regression with explicit  $\ell_1$ norm regularization, we exploit the implicit regularization of decentralized optimization method applied to an over-parameterized nonconvex least squares formulation without penalization. Our first result shows that despite nonconvexity, if the network connectivity is good, the well-known decentralized gradient descent algorithm (DGD) with small initialization and early stopping can compute the statistically optimal solution. Sufficient conditions on the initialization scale,  choice of step size, network connectivity, and stopping time are further provided to achieve convergence. Our result recovers the convergence rate of gradient descent in the centralized setting, showing its tightness. Based on the analysis of DGD, we further propose a communication-efficient version, termed T-DGD, by truncating the iterates before transmission. In the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, we show that T-DGD achieves comparable statistical accuracy to DGD, while the communication cost is logarithmic in the number of parameters. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of DGD and T-DGD for sparse learning through implicit regularization."
Poster,Implicit Regularization of Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Scale-Invariant Problems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93626,"Bingcong Li, Liang Zhang, Niao He","Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) improves generalization of various deep learning tasks. Motivated by popular architectures such as LoRA, we explore the implicit regularization of SAM for scale-invariant problems involving two groups of variables. Instead of focusing on commonly used sharpness, this work introduces a concept termed *balancedness*, defined as the difference between the squared norm of two variables. This allows us to depict richer global behaviors of SAM. In particular, our theoretical and empirical findings reveal that i) SAM promotes balancedness; and ii) the regularization on balancedness is *data-responsive* -- outliers have stronger impact. The latter coincides with empirical observations that SAM outperforms SGD in the presence of outliers. Leveraging the implicit regularization, we develop a resource-efficient SAM variant, balancedness-aware regularization (BAR), tailored for scale-invariant problems such as finetuning language models with LoRA. BAR saves 95% computational overhead of SAM, with enhanced test performance across various tasks on RoBERTa, GPT2, and OPT-1.3B."
Poster,Implicit Regularization Paths of Weighted Neural Representations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93618,"Jin-Hong Du, Pratik Patil","We study the implicit regularization effects induced by (observation) weighting of pretrained features.For weight and feature matrices of bounded operator norms that are infinitesimally free with respect to (normalized) trace functionals, we derive equivalence paths connecting different weighting matrices and ridge regularization levels.Specifically, we show that ridge estimators trained on weighted features along the same path are asymptotically equivalent when evaluated against test vectors of bounded norms.These paths can be interpreted as matching the effective degrees of freedom of ridge estimators fitted with weighted features.For the special case of subsampling without replacement, our results apply to independently sampled random features and kernel features and confirm recent conjectures (Conjectures 7 and 8) of the authors on the existence of such paths in Patil and Du (2023).We also present an additive risk decomposition for ensembles of weighted estimators and show that the risks are equivalent along the paths when the ensemble size goes to infinity.As a practical consequence of the path equivalences, we develop an efficient cross-validation method for tuning and apply it to subsampled pretrained representations across several models (e.g., ResNet-50) and datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100)."
