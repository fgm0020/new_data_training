Poster,Time Makes Space: Emergence of Place Fields in Networks Encoding Temporally Continuous Sensory Experiences,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93988,"Zhaoze Wang, Ronald Di Tullio, Spencer Rooke, Vijay Balasubramanian","The vertebrate hippocampus is thought to use recurrent connectivity in area CA3 to support episodic memory recall from partial cues. This brain area also contains place cells, whose location-selective firing fields implement maps supporting spatial memory. Here we show that place cells emerge in networks trained to remember temporally continuous sensory episodes. We model CA3 as a recurrent autoencoder that recalls and reconstructs sensory experiences from noisy and partially occluded observations by agents traversing simulated arenas. The agents move in realistic trajectories modeled from rodents and environments are modeled as continuously varying, high-dimensional, sensory experience maps (spatially smoothed Gaussian random fields). Training our autoencoder to accurately pattern-complete and reconstruct sensory experiences with a constraint on total activity causes spatially localized firing fields, i.e., place cells, to emerge in the encoding layer. The emergent place fields reproduce key aspects of hippocampal phenomenology: a) remapping (maintenance of and reversion to distinct learned maps in different environments), implemented via repositioning of experience manifolds in the network’s hidden layer, b) orthogonality of spatial representations in different arenas, c) robust place field emergence in differently shaped rooms, with single units showing multiple place fields in large or complex spaces, and (d) slow representational drift of place fields.  We argue that these results arise because continuous traversal of space makes sensory experience temporally continuous. We make testable predictions: a) rapidly changing sensory context will disrupt place fields, b) place fields will form even if recurrent connections are blocked, but reversion to previously learned representations upon remapping will be abolished, c) the dimension of temporally smooth experience sets the dimensionality of place fields, including during virtual navigation of abstract spaces."
Poster,Time-MMD: Multi-Domain Multimodal Dataset for Time Series Analysis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97582,"Haoxin Liu, Shangqing Xu, Zhiyuan Zhao, Lingkai Kong, Harshavardhan Prabhakar Kamarthi, Aditya Sasanur, Megha Sharma, Jiaming Cui, Qingsong Wen, Chao Zhang, B. Aditya Prakash","Time series data are ubiquitous across a wide range of real-world domains. Whilereal-world time series analysis (TSA) requires human experts to integrate numerical series data with multimodal domain-specific knowledge, most existing TSAmodels rely solely on numerical data, overlooking the significance of information beyond numerical series. This oversight is due to the untapped potentialof textual series data and the absence of a comprehensive, high-quality multimodal dataset. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce Time-MMD, the firstmulti-domain, multimodal time series dataset covering 9 primary data domains.Time-MMD ensures fine-grained modality alignment, eliminates data contamination, and provides high usability. Additionally, we develop MM-TSFlib, thefirst-cut multimodal time-series forecasting (TSF) library, seamlessly pipeliningmultimodal TSF evaluations based on Time-MMD for in-depth analyses. Extensiveexperiments conducted on Time-MMD through MM-TSFlib demonstrate significant performance enhancements by extending unimodal TSF to multimodality,evidenced by over 15% mean squared error reduction in general, and up to 40%in domains with rich textual data. More importantly, our datasets and libraryrevolutionize broader applications, impacts, research topics to advance TSA. Thedataset is available at https://github.com/AdityaLab/Time-MMD."
Poster,Time-Reversal Provides Unsupervised Feedback to LLMs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93684,"Yerram Varun, Rahul Madhavan, Sravanti Addepalli, Arun Suggala, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Prateek Jain","Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained to predict in the forward direction of time. However, recent works have shown that prompting these models to look back and critique their own generations can produce useful feedback. Motivated by this, we explore the question of whether LLMs can be empowered to think (predict and score) backwards to provide unsupervised feedback that complements forward LLMs. Towards this, we introduce Time Reversed Language Models (TRLMs), which can score and generate queries when conditioned on responses, effectively functioning in the reverse direction of time. Further, to effectively infer in the response to query direction, we pre-train and fine-tune a language model (TRLM-Ba) in the reverse token order from scratch. We show empirically (and theoretically in a stylized setting) that time-reversed models can indeed complement forward model predictions when used to score the query given response for re-ranking multiple forward generations. We obtain up to 5\% improvement on the widely used AlpacaEval Leaderboard over the competent baseline of best-of-N re-ranking using self log-perplexity scores. We further show that TRLM scoring outperforms conventional forward scoring of response given query, resulting in significant gains in applications such as citation generation and passage retrieval. We next leverage the generative ability of TRLM to augment or provide unsupervised feedback to input safety filters of LLMs, demonstrating a drastic reduction in false negative rate with negligible impact on false positive rates against several attacks published on the popular JailbreakBench leaderboard."
Poster,Time-Varying LoRA: Towards Effective Cross-Domain Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95088,"Zhan Zhuang, Yulong Zhang, Xuehao Wang, Jiangang Lu, Ying Wei, Yu Zhang","Large-scale diffusion models are adept at generating high-fidelity images and facilitating image editing and interpolation. However, they have limitations when tasked with generating images in dynamic, evolving domains. In this paper, we introduce Terra, a novel Time-varying low-rank adapter that offers a fine-tuning framework specifically tailored for domain flow generation. The key innovation of Terra lies in its construction of a continuous parameter manifold through a time variable, with its expressive power analyzed theoretically. This framework not only enables interpolation of image content and style but also offers a generation-based approach to address the domain shift problems in unsupervised domain adaptation and domain generalization. Specifically, Terra transforms images from the source domain to the target domain and generates interpolated domains with various styles to bridge the gap between domains and enhance the model generalization, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Terra. Our source code is publicly available on https://github.com/zwebzone/terra."
Poster,TimeXer: Empowering Transformers for Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95770,"Yuxuan Wang, Haixu Wu, Jiaxiang Dong, Guo Qin, Haoran Zhang, Yong Liu, Yunzhong Qiu, Jianmin Wang, Mingsheng Long","Deep models have demonstrated remarkable performance in time series forecasting. However, due to the partially-observed nature of real-world applications, solely focusing on the target of interest, so-called endogenous variables, is usually insufficient to guarantee accurate forecasting. Notably, a system is often recorded into multiple variables, where the exogenous variables can provide valuable external information for endogenous variables. Thus, unlike well-established multivariate or univariate forecasting paradigms that either treat all the variables equally or ignore exogenous information, this paper focuses on a more practical setting: time series forecasting with exogenous variables. We propose a novel approach, TimeXer, to ingest external information to enhance the forecasting of endogenous variables. With deftly designed embedding layers, TimeXer empowers the canonical Transformer with the ability to reconcile endogenous and exogenous information, where patch-wise self-attention and variate-wise cross-attention are used simultaneously. Moreover, global endogenous tokens are learned to effectively bridge the causal information underlying exogenous series into endogenous temporal patches. Experimentally, TimeXer achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance on twelve real-world forecasting benchmarks and exhibits notable generality and scalability. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/TimeXer."
Poster,TinyLUT: Tiny Look-Up Table for Efficient Image Restoration at the Edge,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93340,"Huanan LI, Juntao Guan, Lai Rui, Sijun Ma, Lin Gu, Noperson","Look-up tables(LUTs)-based methods have recently shown enormous potential in image restoration tasks, which are capable of significantly accelerating the inference. However, the size of LUT exhibits exponential growth with the convolution kernel size, creating a storage bottleneck for its broader application on edge devices. Here, we address the storage explosion challenge to promote the capacity of mapping the complex CNN models by LUT. We introduce an innovative separable mapping strategy to achieve over $7\times$ storage reduction, transforming the storage from exponential dependence on kernel size to a linear relationship. Moreover, we design a dynamic discretization mechanism to decompose the activation and compress the quantization scale that further shrinks the LUT storage by $4.48\times$. As a result, the storage requirement of our proposed TinyLUT is around 4.1\% of MuLUT-SDY-X2 and amenable to on-chip cache, yielding competitive accuracy with over $5\times$ lower inference latency on Raspberry 4B than FSRCNN. Our proposed TinyLUT enables superior inference speed on edge devices with new state-of-the-art accuracy on both of image super-resolution and denoising, showcasing the potential of applying this method to various image restoration tasks at the edge.

Poster,Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs): Fast Pre-trained Models for Enhanced Zero/Few-Shot Forecasting of Multivariate Time Series,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96748,"Vijay Ekambaram, Arindam Jati, Pankaj Dayama, Sumanta Mukherjee, Nam Nguyen, Wesley M Gifford, Chandra Reddy, Jayant Kalagnanam","Large pre-trained models excel in zero/few-shot learning for language and vision tasks but face challenges in multivariate time series (TS) forecasting due to diverse data characteristics. Consequently, recent research efforts have focused on developing pre-trained TS forecasting models. These models, whether built from scratch or adapted from large language models (LLMs), excel in zero/few-shot forecasting tasks. However, they are limited by slow performance, high computational demands, and neglect of cross-channel and exogenous correlations. To address this, we introduce Tiny Time Mixers (TTM), a compact model (starting from 1M parameters) with effective transfer learning capabilities, trained exclusively on public TS datasets. TTM, based on the light-weight TSMixer architecture, incorporates innovations like adaptive patching, diverse resolution sampling, and resolution prefix tuning to handle pre-training on varied dataset resolutions with minimal model capacity. Additionally, it employs multi-level modeling to capture channel correlations and infuse exogenous signals during fine-tuning. TTM outperforms existing popular benchmarks in zero/few-shot forecasting  by (4-40\%), while reducing computational requirements significantly. Moreover, TTMs are lightweight and can be executed even on CPU-only machines, enhancing usability and fostering wider adoption in resource-constrained environments. The model weights for reproducibility and research use are available at https://huggingface.co/ibm/ttm-research-r2/, while enterprise-use weights under the Apache license can be accessed as follows: the initial TTM-Q variant at https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r1, and the latest variants (TTM-B, TTM-E, TTM-A) weights are available at https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-r2.

Poster,TinyTTA: Efficient Test-time Adaptation via Early-exit Ensembles on Edge Devices,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94778,"Hong Jia, Young Kwon, Alessio Orsino, Ting Dang, DOMENICO TALIA, Cecilia Mascolo","The increased adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to the generation of large data streams with applications in healthcare, sustainability, and robotics. In some cases, deep neural networks have been deployed directly on these resource-constrained units to limit communication overhead, increase efficiency and privacy, and enable real-time applications. However, a common challenge in this setting is the continuous adaptation of models necessary to accommodate changing environments, i.e., data distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as one potential solution, but its validity has yet to be explored in resource-constrained hardware settings, such as those involving microcontroller units (MCUs). TTA on constrained devices generally suffers from i) memory overhead due to the full backpropagation of a large pre-trained network, ii) lack of support for normalization layers on MCUs, and iii) either memory exhaustion with large batch sizes required for updating or poor performance with small batch sizes. In this paper, we propose TinyTTA, to enable, for the first time, efficient TTA on constrained devices with limited memory. To address the limited memory constraints, we introduce a novel self-ensemble and batch-agnostic early-exit strategy for TTA, which enables continuous adaptation with small batch sizes for reduced memory usage, handles distribution shifts, and improves latency efficiency. Moreover, we develop the TinyTTA Engine, a first-of-its-kind MCU library that enables on-device TTA. We validate TinyTTA on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W and an STM32H747 MCU. Experimental results demonstrate that TinyTTA improves TTA accuracy by up to 57.6\%, reduces memory usage by up to six times, and achieves faster and more energy-efficient TTA. Notably, TinyTTA is the only framework able to run TTA on MCU STM32H747 with a 512 KB memory constraint while maintaining high performance."
Poster,To Believe or Not to Believe Your LLM: Iterative Prompting for Estimating Epistemic Uncertainty,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93918,"Yasin Abbasi Yadkori, Ilja Kuzborskij, András György, Csaba Szepesvari","We explore uncertainty quantification in large language models (LLMs), with the goal to identify when uncertainty in responses given a query is large. We simultaneously consider both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, where the former comes from the lack of knowledge about the ground truth (such as about facts or the language), and the latter comes from irreducible randomness (such as multiple possible answers). In particular, we derive an information-theoretic metric that allows to reliably detect when only epistemic uncertainty is large, in which case the output of the model is unreliable. This condition can be computed based solely on the output of the model obtained simply by some special iterative prompting based on the previous responses. Such quantification, for instance, allows to detect hallucinations (cases when epistemic uncertainty is high) in both single- and multi-answer responses. This is in contrast to many standard uncertainty quantification strategies (such as thresholding the log-likelihood of a response) where hallucinations in the multi-answer case cannot be detected. We conduct a series of experiments which demonstrate the advantage of our formulation. Further, our investigations shed some light on how the probabilities assigned to a given output by an LLM can be amplified by iterative prompting, which might be of independent interest."
Poster,To Err Like Human: Affective Bias-Inspired Measures for Visual Emotion Recognition Evaluation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93696,"Chenxi Zhao, Jinglei Shi, Liqiang Nie, Jufeng Yang","Accuracy is a commonly adopted performance metric in various classification tasks, which measures the proportion of correctly classified samples among all samples. It assumes equal importance for all classes, hence equal severity for misclassifications. However, in the task of emotional classification, due to the psychological similarities between emotions, misclassifying a certain emotion into one class may be more severe than another, e.g., misclassifying 'excitement' as 'anger' apparently is more severe than as 'awe'. Albeit high meaningful for many applications, metrics capable of measuring these cases of misclassifications in visual emotion recognition tasks have yet to be explored. In this paper, based on Mikel's emotion wheel from psychology, we propose a novel approach for evaluating the performance in visual emotion recognition, which takes into account the distance on the emotion wheel between different emotions to mimic the psychological nuances of emotions. Experimental results in semi-supervised learning on emotion recognition and user study have shown that our proposed metrics is more effective than the accuracy to assess the performance and conforms to the cognitive laws of human emotions.
