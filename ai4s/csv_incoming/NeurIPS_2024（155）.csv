Poster,"First-Explore, then Exploit: Meta-Learning to Solve Hard Exploration-Exploitation Trade-Offs",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96238,"Ben Norman, Jeff Clune","Standard reinforcement learning (RL) agents never intelligently explore like a human (i.e. taking into account complex domain priors and adapting quickly based on previous exploration). Across episodes, RL agents struggle to perform even simple exploration strategies, for example systematic search that avoids exploring the same location multiple times. This poor exploration limits performance on challenging domains. Meta-RL is a potential solution, as unlike standard RL, meta-RL can *learn* to explore, and potentially learn highly complex strategies far beyond those of standard RL, strategies such as experimenting in early episodes to learn new skills, or conducting experiments to learn about the current environment.Traditional meta-RL focuses on the problem of learning to optimally balance exploration and exploitation to maximize the *cumulative reward* of the episode sequence (e.g., aiming to maximize the total wins in a tournament -- while also improving as a player).We identify a new challenge with state-of-the-art cumulative-reward meta-RL methods.When optimal behavior requires exploration that sacrifices immediate reward to enable higher subsequent reward, existing state-of-the-art cumulative-reward meta-RL methods become stuck on the local optimum of failing to explore.Our method, First-Explore, overcomes this limitation by learning two policies: one to solely explore, and one to solely exploit. When exploring requires forgoing early-episode reward, First-Explore significantly outperforms existing cumulative meta-RL methods. By identifying and solving the previously unrecognized problem of forgoing reward in early episodes, First-Explore represents a significant step towards developing meta-RL algorithms capable of human-like exploration on a broader range of domains."
Poster,First-Order Methods for Linearly Constrained Bilevel Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94279,"Guy Kornowski, Swati Padmanabhan, Kai Wang, Zhe Zhang, Suvrit Sra","Algorithms for bilevel optimization often encounter Hessian computations, which are prohibitive in high dimensions. While recent works offer first-order methods for unconstrained bilevel problems, the constrained setting remains relatively underexplored. We present  first-order linearly constrained optimization methods with finite-time hypergradient stationarity guarantees. For linear equality constraints, we attain $\epsilon$-stationarity in $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ gradient oracle calls, which is nearly-optimal. For linear inequality constraints, we attain $(\delta,\epsilon)$-Goldstein stationarity in $\widetilde{O}(d{\delta^{-1} \epsilon^{-3}})$ gradient oracle calls, where $d$ is the upper-level dimension. Finally, we obtain for the linear inequality setting dimension-free rates of $\widetilde{O}({\delta^{-1} \epsilon^{-4}})$ oracle complexity under the additional assumption of oracle access to the optimal dual variable. Along the way, we develop new nonsmooth nonconvex optimization methods with inexact oracles. Our numerical experiments verify these guarantees."
Poster,First-Order Minimax Bilevel Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95895,"Yifan Yang, Zhaofeng Si, Siwei Lyu, Kaiyi Ji","Multi-block minimax bilevel optimization has been studied recently due to its great potential in multi-task learning, robust machine learning, and few-shot learning. However, due to the complex three-level optimization structure, existing algorithms often suffer from issues such as high computing costs due to the second-order model derivatives or high memory consumption in storing all blocks' parameters. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing two novel fully first-order algorithms named FOSL and MemCS. FOSL features a fully single-loop structure by updating all three variables simultaneously, and MemCS is a memory-efficient double-loop algorithm with cold-start initialization. We provide a comprehensive convergence analysis for both algorithms under full and partial block participation, and show that their sample complexities match or outperform those of the same type of methods in standard bilevel optimization. We evaluate our methods in two applications: the recently proposed multi-task deep AUC maximization and a novel rank-based robust meta-learning. Our methods consistently improve over existing methods with better performance over various datasets."
Poster,Fisher Flow Matching for Generative Modeling over Discrete Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96502,"Oscar Davis, Samuel Kessler, Mircea Petrache, Ismail Ceylan, Michael Bronstein, Joey Bose","Generative modeling over discrete data has recently seen numerous success stories, with applications spanning language modeling, biological sequence design, and graph-structured molecular data. The predominant generative modeling paradigm for discrete data is still autoregressive, with more recent alternatives based on diffusion or flow-matching falling short of their impressive performance in continuous data settings, such as image or video generation. In this work, we introduce Fisher-Flow, a novel flow-matching model for discrete data. Fisher-Flow takes a manifestly geometric perspectiveby considering categorical distributions over discrete data as points residing on a statistical manifold equipped with its natural Riemannian metric: the \emph{Fisher-Rao metric}. As a result, we demonstrate discrete data itself can be continuously reparameterised to points on the positive orthant of the $d$-hypersphere $\mathbb{S}^d_+$, which allows us to define flows that map any source distribution to target in a principled manner by transporting mass along (closed-form) geodesics of $\mathbb{S}^d_+$. Furthermore, the learned flows in Fisher-Flow can be further bootstrapped by leveraging Riemannian optimal transport leading to improved training dynamics. We prove that the gradient flow induced by Fisher-FLow is optimal in reducing the forward KL divergence. We evaluate Fisher-Flow on an array of synthetic and diverse real-world benchmarks, including designing DNA Promoter, and DNA Enhancer sequences. Empirically, we find that Fisher-Flow improves over prior diffusion and flow-matching models on these benchmarks."
Poster,"Fit for our purpose, not yours: Benchmark for a low-resource, Indigenous language",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97451,"Suzanne Duncan, Gianna Leoni, Lee Steven, Keoni K Mahelona, Peter Lucas K Jones","Influential and popular benchmarks in AI are largely irrelevant to developing NLP tools for low-resource, Indigenous languages. With the primary goal of measuring the performance of general-purpose AI systems, these benchmarks fail to give due consideration and care to individual language communities, especially low-resource languages. The datasets contain numerous grammatical and orthographic errors, poor pronunciation, limited vocabulary, and the content lacks cultural relevance to the language community. To overcome the issues with these benchmarks, we have created a dataset for te reo Māori (the Indigenous language of Aotearoa/New Zealand) to pursue NLP tools that are ‘fit-for-our-purpose’. This paper demonstrates how low-resourced, Indigenous languages can develop tailored, high-quality benchmarks that; i. Consider the impact of colonisation on their language; ii. Reflect the diversity of speakers in the language community; iii. Support the aspirations for the tools they are developing and their language revitalisation efforts."
Poster,FiVA: Fine-grained Visual Attribute Dataset for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97663,"Tong Wu, Yinghao Xu, Ryan Po, Mengchen Zhang, Guandao Yang, Jiaqi Wang, Ziwei Liu, Dahua Lin, Gordon Wetzstein","Recent advances in text-to-image generation have enabled the creation of high-quality images with diverse applications. However, accurately describing desired visual attributes can be challenging, especially for non-experts in art and photography. An intuitive solution involves adopting favorable attributes from source images. Current methods attempt to distill identity and style from source images. However, ""style"" is a broad concept that includes texture, color, and artistic elements, but does not cover other important attributes like lighting and dynamics. Additionally, a simplified ""style"" adaptation prevents combining multiple attributes from different sources into one generated image. In this work, we formulate a more effective approach to decompose the aesthetics of a picture into specific visual attributes, letting users apply characteristics like lighting, texture, and dynamics from different images. To achieve this goal, we constructed the first fine-grained visual attributes dataset (FiVA) to the best of our knowledge. This FiVA dataset features a well-organized taxonomy for visual attributes and includes 1 M high-quality generated images with visual attribute annotations. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a fine-grained visual attributes adaptation framework (FiVA-Adapter) , which decouples and adapts visual attributes from one or more source images into a generated one. This approach enhances user-friendly customization, allowing users to selectively apply desired attributes to create images that meet their unique preferences and specific content requirements."
Poster,Fixed Confidence Best Arm Identification in the Bayesian Setting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94082,"Kyoungseok Jang, Junpei Komiyama, Kazutoshi Yamazaki","We consider the fixed-confidence best arm identification (FC-BAI) problem in the Bayesian setting. This problem aims to find the arm of the largest mean with a fixed confidence level when the bandit model has been sampled from the known prior. Most studies on the FC-BAI problem have been conducted in the frequentist setting, where the bandit model is predetermined before the game starts. We show that the traditional FC-BAI algorithms studied in the frequentist setting, such as track-and-stop and top-two algorithms, result in arbitrarily suboptimal performances in the Bayesian setting. We also obtain a lower bound of the expected number of samples in the Bayesian setting and introduce a variant of successive elimination that has a matching performance with the lower bound up to a logarithmic factor. Simulations verify the theoretical results."
Poster,Fixed points of nonnegative neural networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/98331,"Tomasz J. Piotrowski, Renato L. G. Cavalcante, Mateusz Gabor","We use fixed point theory to analyze nonnegative neural networks, which we define as neural networks that map nonnegative vectors to nonnegative vectors. We first show that nonnegative neural networks with nonnegative weights and biases can be recognized as monotonic and (weakly) scalable mappings within the framework of nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory. This fact enables us to provide conditions for the existence of fixed points of nonnegative neural networks having inputs and outputs of the same dimension, and these conditions are weaker than those recently obtained  using arguments in convex analysis. Furthermore, we prove that the shape of the fixed point set of nonnegative neural networks with nonnegative weights and biases is an interval, which under mild conditions degenerates to a point. These results are then used to obtain the existence of fixed points of more general nonnegative neural networks. From a practical perspective, our results contribute to the understanding of the behavior of autoencoders, and we also offer valuable mathematical machinery for future developments in deep equilibrium models."
Poster,(FL)$^2$: Overcoming Few Labels in Federated Semi-Supervised Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93810,"Seungjoo Lee, Thanh-Long V. Le, Jaemin Shin, Sung-Ju Lee","Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework that trains accurate global models while preserving clients' privacy-sensitive data. However, most FL approaches assume that clients possess labeled data, which is often not the case in practice. Federated Semi-Supervised Learning (FSSL) addresses this label deficiency problem, targeting situations where only the server has a small amount of labeled data while clients do not. However, a significant performance gap exists between Centralized Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and FSSL. This gap arises from confirmation bias, which is more pronounced in FSSL due to multiple local training epochs and the separation of labeled and unlabeled data. We propose $(FL)^2$, a robust training method for unlabeled clients using sharpness-aware consistency regularization. We show that regularizing the original pseudo-labeling loss is suboptimal, and hence we carefully select unlabeled samples for regularization. We further introduce client-specific adaptive thresholding and learning status-aware aggregation to adjust the training process based on the learning progress of each client. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves performance and bridges the gap with SSL, particularly in scenarios with scarce labeled data."
Poster,FLAME : Factuality-Aware Alignment for Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92950,"Sheng-Chieh Lin, Luyu Gao, Barlas Oguz, Wenhan Xiong, Jimmy Lin, Scott Yih, Xilun Chen","Alignment is a procedure to fine-tune pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to follow natural language instructions and serve as helpful AI assistants. We have observed, however, that the conventional alignment process fails to enhance the factual accuracy of LLMs, and often leads to the generation of more false facts (i.e., *hallucination*). In this paper, we study how to make the LLM alignment process more factual, by first identifying factors that lead to hallucination in both alignment steps: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).In particular, we find that training the LLM on new or unfamiliar knowledge can encourage hallucination.This makes SFT less factual as it trains on human-labeled data that may be novel to the LLM. Furthermore, reward functions used in standard RL often inadequately capture factuality and favor longer and more detailed responses, which inadvertently promote hallucination.Based on these observations, we propose *FactuaLity-aware AlignMEnt*, comprised of *factuality-aware SFT* and *factuality-aware RL* through direct preference optimization. Experiments show that our proposed *FLAME* guides LLMs to output more factual responses while maintaining their instruction-following capability."
