Poster,ProTransformer: Robustify Transformers via Plug-and-Play Paradigm,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94947,"Zhichao Hou, Weizhi Gao, Yuchen Shen, Feiyi Wang, Xiaorui Liu","Transformer-based architectures have dominated various areas of machine learning in recent years. In this paper, we introduce a novel robust attention mechanism designed to enhance the resilience of transformer-based architectures. Crucially, this technique can be integrated into existing transformers as a plug-and-play layer, improving their robustness without the need for additional training or fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our ProTransformer significantly enhances the robustness of transformer models across a variety of prediction tasks, attack mechanisms, backbone architectures, and data domains. Notably, without further fine-tuning, the ProTransformer consistently improves the performance of vanilla transformers by 19.5\%, 28.3\%, 16.1\%, and 11.4\% for BERT, ALBERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa, respectively, under the classical TextFooler attack. Furthermore, ProTransformer shows promising resilience in large language models (LLMs) against prompting-based attacks, improving the performance of T5 and LLaMA by 24.8\% and 17.8\%, respectively, and enhancing Vicuna by an average of 10.4\% against the Jailbreaking attack. Beyond the language domain, ProTransformer also demonstrates outstanding robustness in both vision and graph domains."
Poster,Provable Acceleration of Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient for Asymmetric Matrix Factorization and Linear Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94792,"Zhenghao Xu, Yuqing Wang, Tuo Zhao, Rachel Ward, Molei Tao","We study the convergence rate of first-order methods for rectangular matrix factorization, which is a canonical nonconvex optimization problem. Specifically, given a rank-$r$ matrix $\mathbf{A}\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, we prove that gradient descent (GD) can find a pair of $\epsilon$-optimal solutions $\mathbf{X}_T\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times d}$ and $\mathbf{Y}_T\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, where $d\geq r$, satisfying $\lVert\mathbf{X}_T\mathbf{Y}_T^\top-\mathbf{A}\rVert_F\leq\epsilon\lVert\mathbf{A}\rVert_F$ in $T=O(\kappa^2\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ iterations with high probability, where $\kappa$ denotes the condition number of $\mathbf{A}$. Furthermore, we prove that Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG) attains an iteration complexity of $O(\kappa\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$, which is the best-known bound of first-order methods for rectangular matrix factorization. Different from small balanced random initialization in the existing literature, we adopt an unbalanced initialization, where $\mathbf{X}_0$ is large and $\mathbf{Y}_0$ is $0$. Moreover, our initialization and analysis can be further extended to linear neural networks, where we prove that NAG can also attain an accelerated linear convergence rate. In particular, we only require the width of the network to be greater than or equal to the rank of the output label matrix. In contrast, previous results achieving the same rate require excessive widths that additionally depend on the condition number and the rank of the input data matrix."
Poster,Provable and Efficient Dataset Distillation for Kernel Ridge Regression,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94841,"Yilan Chen, Wei Huang, Lily Weng","Deep learning models are now trained on increasingly larger datasets, making it crucial to reduce computational costs and improve data quality. Dataset distillation aims to distill a large dataset into a small synthesized dataset such that models trained on it can achieve similar performance to those trained on the original dataset. While there have been many empirical efforts to improve dataset distillation algorithms, a thorough theoretical analysis and provable, efficient algorithms are still lacking. In this paper, by focusing on dataset distillation for kernel ridge regression (KRR), we show that one data point per class is already necessary and sufficient to recover the original model's performance in many settings. For linear ridge regression and KRR with surjective feature mappings, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the distilled dataset to recover the original model's parameters. For KRR with injective feature mappings of deep neural networks, we show that while one data point per class is not sufficient in general, $k+1$ data points can be sufficient for deep linear neural networks, where $k$ is the number of classes. Our theoretical results enable directly constructing analytical solutions for distilled datasets, resulting in a provable and efficient dataset distillation algorithm for KRR. We verify our theory experimentally and show that our algorithm outperforms previous work such as KIP while being significantly more efficient, e.g. 15840$\times$ faster on CIFAR-100. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/Trustworthy-ML-Lab/provable-efficient-dataset-distill-KRR}{GitHub}."
Poster,Provable Benefit of Cutout and CutMix for Feature Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96348,"Junsoo Oh, Chulhee Yun","Patch-level data augmentation techniques such as Cutout and CutMix have demonstrated significant efficacy in enhancing the performance of vision tasks. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains elusive. In this paper, we study two-layer neural networks trained using three distinct methods: vanilla training without augmentation, Cutout training, and CutMix training. Our analysis focuses on a feature-noise data model, which consists of several label-dependent features of varying rarity and label-independent noises of differing strengths. Our theorems demonstrate that Cutout training can learn low-frequency features that vanilla training cannot, while CutMix training can learn even rarer features that Cutout cannot capture. From this, we establish that CutMix yields the highest test accuracy among the three. Our novel analysis reveals that CutMix training makes the network learn all features and noise vectors ""evenly"" regardless of the rarity and strength, which provides an interesting insight into understanding patch-level augmentation."
Poster,Provable Benefits of Complex Parameterizations for Structured State Space Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94101,"Yuval Ran-Milo, Eden Lumbroso, Edo Cohen-Karlik, Raja Giryes, Amir Globerson, Nadav Cohen","Structured state space models (SSMs), the core engine behind prominent neural networks such as S4 and Mamba, are linear dynamical systems adhering to a specified structure, most notably diagonal. In contrast to typical neural network modules, whose parameterizations are real, SSMs often use complex parameterizations. Theoretically explaining the benefits of complex parameterizations for SSMs is an open problem. The current paper takes a step towards its resolution, by establishing formal gaps between real and complex diagonal SSMs. Firstly, we prove that while a moderate dimension suffices in order for a complex SSM to express all mappings of a real SSM, a much higher dimension is needed for a real SSM to express mappings of a complex SSM. Secondly, we prove that even if the dimension of a real SSM is high enough to express a given mapping, typically, doing so requires the parameters of the real SSM to hold exponentially large values, which cannot be learned in practice. In contrast, a complex SSM can express any given mapping with moderate parameter values. Experiments corroborate our theory, and suggest a potential extension of the theory that accounts for selectivity, a new architectural feature yielding state of the art performance."
Poster,Provable Editing of Deep Neural Networks using Parametric Linear Relaxation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95777,"Zhe Tao, Aditya V Thakur","Ensuring that a DNN satisfies a desired property is critical when deploying DNNs in safety-critical applications. There are efficient methods that can verify whether a DNN satisfies a property, as seen in the annual DNN verification competition (VNN-COMP). However, the problem of provably editing a DNN to satisfy a property remains challenging. We present PREPARED, the first efficient technique for provable editing of DNNs. Given a DNN $\mathcal{N}$ with parameters $\theta$, input polytope $P$, and output polytope $Q$, PREPARED finds new parameters $\theta'$ such that $\forall \mathrm{x} \in P . \mathcal{N}(\mathrm{x}; \theta') \in Q$ while minimizing the changes $\lVert{\theta' - \theta}\rVert$. Given a DNN and a property it violates from the VNN-COMP benchmarks, PREPARED is able to provably edit the DNN to satisfy this property within 45 seconds. PREPARED is efficient because it relaxes the NP-hard provable editing problem to solving a linear program. The key contribution is the novel notion of Parametric Linear Relaxation, which enables PREPARED to construct tight output bounds of the DNN that are parameterized by the new parameters $\theta'$. We demonstrate that PREPARED is more efficient and effective compared to prior DNN editing approaches i) using the VNN-COMP benchmarks, ii) by editing CIFAR10 and TinyImageNet image-recognition DNNs, and BERT sentiment-classification DNNs for local robustness, and iii) by training a DNN to model a geodynamics process and satisfy physics constraints."
Poster,Provable Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning with Privileged Information,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93646,"Yang Cai, Xiangyu Liu, Argyris Oikonomou, Kaiqing Zhang","Partial observability of the underlying states generally presents significant challenges for reinforcement learning (RL). In practice, certain *privileged information* , e.g., the access to states from simulators, has been exploited in training and achieved prominent empirical successes. To better understand the benefits of privileged information, we revisit and examine several simple and practically used paradigms in this setting, with both computation and sample efficiency analyses. Specifically, we first formalize the empirical paradigm of *expert distillation* (also known as  *teacher-student* learning), demonstrating its pitfall in finding near-optimal policies. We then identify a condition of the partially observable environment, the deterministic filter condition, under which expert distillation achieves sample and computational complexities that are *both* polynomial. Furthermore, we investigate another successful empirical paradigm of *asymmetric actor-critic*, and focus on the more challenging setting of observable partially observable Markov decision processes. We develop a belief-weighted optimistic asymmetric actor-critic algorithm with polynomial sample and quasi-polynomial computational complexities, where one key component is a new provable oracle for learning belief states that preserve *filter stability* under a misspecified model, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we also investigate the provable efficiency of partially observable multi-agent RL (MARL) with privileged information. We develop algorithms with the feature of centralized-training-with-decentralized-execution, a popular framework in empirical MARL, with polynomial sample and (quasi-)polynomial computational complexity in both paradigms above. Compared with a few recent related theoretical studies, our focus is on understanding practically inspired algorithmic paradigms, without computationally intractable oracles."
Poster,Provable Posterior Sampling with Denoising Oracles via Tilted Transport,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95291,"Joan Bruna, Jiequn Han","Score-based diffusion models have significantly advanced high-dimensional data generation across various domains, by learning a denoising oracle (or score) from datasets. From a Bayesian perspective, they offer a realistic modeling of data priors and facilitate solving inverse problems through posterior sampling. Although many heuristic methods have been developed recently for this purpose, they lack the quantitative guarantees needed in many scientific applications. This work addresses the topic from two perspectives. We first present a hardness result indicating that a generic method leveraging the prior denoising oracle for posterior sampling becomes infeasible as soon as the measurement operator is mildly ill-conditioned. We next develop the *tilted transport* technique, which leverages the quadratic structure of the log-likelihood in linear inverse problems in combination with the prior denoising oracle to exactly transform the original posterior sampling problem into a new one that is provably easier to sample from. We quantify the conditions under which the boosted posterior is strongly log-concave, highlighting how task difficulty depends on the condition number of the measurement matrix and the signal-to-noise ratio. The resulting general scheme is shown to match the best-known sampling methods for Ising models, and is further validated on high-dimensional Gaussian mixture models."
Poster,Provable Tempered Overfitting of Minimal Nets and Typical Nets,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95208,"Itamar Harel, William Hoza, Gal Vardi, Itay Evron, Nati Srebro, Daniel Soudry","We study the overfitting behavior of fully connected deep Neural Networks (NNs) with binary weights fitted to perfectly classify a noisy training set. We consider interpolation using both the smallest NN (having the minimal number of weights) and a random interpolating NN. For both learning rules, we prove overfitting is tempered. Our analysis rests on a new bound on the size of a threshold circuit consistent with a partial function. To the best of our knowledge, ours are the first theoretical results on benign or tempered overfitting that: (1) apply to deep NNs, and (2) do not require a very high or very low input dimension."
Poster,Provably and Practically Efficient Adversarial Imitation Learning with General Function Approximation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96439,"Tian Xu, Zhilong Zhang, Ruishuo Chen, Yihao Sun, Yang Yu","As a prominent category of imitation learning methods, adversarial imitation learning (AIL) has garnered significant practical success powered by neural network approximation. However, existing theoretical studies on AIL are primarily limited to simplified scenarios such as tabular and linear function approximation and involve complex algorithmic designs that hinder practical implementation, highlighting a gap between theory and practice. In this paper, we explore the theoretical underpinnings of online AIL with general function approximation. We introduce a new method called optimization-based AIL (OPT-AIL), which centers on performing online optimization for reward functions and optimism-regularized Bellman error minimization for Q-value functions. Theoretically, we prove that OPT-AIL achieves polynomial expert sample complexity and interaction complexity for learning near-expert policies. To our best knowledge, OPT-AIL is the first provably efficient AIL method with general function approximation. Practically, OPT-AIL only requires the approximate optimization of two objectives, thereby facilitating practical implementation. Empirical studies demonstrate that OPT-AIL outperforms previous state-of-the-art deep AIL methods in several challenging tasks."
