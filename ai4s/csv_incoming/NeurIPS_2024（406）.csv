Poster,The Well: a Large-Scale Collection of Diverse Physics Simulations for Machine Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97882,"Ruben Ohana, Michael McCabe, Lucas Meyer, Rudy Morel, Fruzsina Agocs, Miguel Beneitez, Marsha Berger, Blakesly Burkhart, Stuart Dalziel, Drummond Fielding, Daniel Fortunato, Jared Goldberg, Keiya Hirashima, Yan-Fei Jiang, Rich Kerswell, Suryanarayana Maddu, Jonah Miller, Payel Mukhopadhyay, Stefan Nixon, Jeff Shen, Romain Watteaux, Bruno Régaldo-Saint Blancard, François Rozet, Liam Parker, Miles Cranmer, Shirley Ho","Machine learning based surrogate models offer researchers powerful tools for accelerating simulation-based workflows. However, as standard datasets in this space often cover small classes of physical behavior, it can be difficult to evaluate the efficacy of new approaches. To address this gap, we introduce the Well: a large-scale collection of datasets containing numerical simulations of a wide variety of spatiotemporal physical systems. The Well draws from domain experts and numerical software developers to provide 15TB of data across 16 datasets covering diverse domains such as biological systems, fluid dynamics, acoustic scattering, as well as magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of extra-galactic fluids or supernova explosions. These datasets can be used individually or as part of a broader benchmark suite. To facilitate usage of the Well, we provide a unified PyTorch interface for training and evaluating models. We demonstrate the function of this library by introducing example baselines that highlight the new challenges posed by the complex dynamics of the Well. The code and data is available at https://github.com/PolymathicAI/the_well."
Poster,Thinking Forward: Memory-Efficient Federated Finetuning of Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94351,"Kunjal Panchal, Nisarg Parikh, Sunav Choudhary, Lijun Zhang, Yuriy Brun, Hui Guan","Finetuning large language models (LLMs) in federated learning (FL) settings has become increasingly important as it allows resource-constrained devices to finetune a model using private data. However, finetuning LLMs using backpropagation requires excessive memory (especially from intermediate activations) for resource-constrained devices. While Forward-mode Auto-Differentiation (AD) can significantly reduce memory footprint from activations, we observe that directly applying it to LLM finetuning results in slow convergence and poor accuracy. In this paper, we introduce Spry, an FL algorithm that splits trainable weights of an LLM among participating clients, such that each client computes gradients using forward-mode AD that are closer estimations of the true gradients. Spry achieves a low memory footprint, high accuracy, and fast convergence. We formally prove that the global gradients in Spry are unbiased estimators of true global gradients for homogeneous data distributions across clients, while heterogeneity increases bias of the estimates. We also derive Spry's convergence rate, showing that the gradients decrease inversely proportional to the number of FL rounds, indicating the convergence up to the limits of heterogeneity. Empirically, Spry reduces the memory footprint during training by 1.4-7.1$\times$ in contrast to backpropagation, while reaching comparable accuracy, across a wide range of language tasks, models, and FL settings. Spry reduces the convergence time by 1.2-20.3$\times$ and achieves 5.2-13.5\% higher accuracy against state-of-the-art zero-order methods. When finetuning Llama2-7B with LoRA, compared to the peak memory consumption of 33.9GB of backpropagation, Spry only consumes 6.2GB of peak memory. For OPT13B, the reduction is from 76.5GB to 10.8GB. Spry makes feasible previously impossible FL deployments on commodity mobile and edge devices. Our source code is available for replication at https://github.com/Astuary/Spry."
Poster,This Too Shall Pass: Removing Stale Observations in Dynamic Bayesian Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93900,"Anthony Bardou, Patrick Thiran, Giovanni Ranieri","Bayesian Optimization (BO) has proven to be very successful at optimizing a static, noisy, costly-to-evaluate black-box function $f : \mathcal{S} \to \mathbb{R}$. However, optimizing a black-box which is also a function of time (*i.e.*, a *dynamic* function) $f : \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{T} \to \mathbb{R}$ remains a challenge, since a dynamic Bayesian Optimization (DBO) algorithm has to keep track of the optimum over time. This changes the nature of the optimization problem in at least three aspects: (i) querying an arbitrary point in $\mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{T}$ is impossible, (ii) past observations become less and less relevant for keeping track of the optimum as time goes by and (iii) the DBO algorithm must have a high sampling frequency so it can collect enough relevant observations to keep track of the optimum through time. In this paper, we design a Wasserstein distance-based criterion able to quantify the relevancy of an observation with respect to future predictions. Then, we leverage this criterion to build W-DBO, a DBO algorithm able to remove irrelevant observations from its dataset on the fly, thus maintaining simultaneously a good predictive performance and a high sampling frequency, even in continuous-time optimization tasks with unknown horizon. Numerical experiments establish the superiority of W-DBO, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a comfortable margin."
Poster,Thompson Sampling For Combinatorial Bandits: Polynomial Regret and Mismatched Sampling Paradox,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95322,"Raymond Zhang, Richard Combes",We consider Thompson Sampling (TS) for linear combinatorial semi-bandits and subgaussian rewards. We propose the first known TS whose finite-time regret does not scale exponentially with the dimension of the problem. We further show the mismatched sampling paradox: A learner who knows the rewards distributions and samples from the correct posterior distribution can perform exponentially worse than a learner who does not know the rewards and simply samples from a well-chosen Gaussian posterior. The code used to generate the experiments is available at https://github.com/RaymZhang/CTS-Mismatched-Paradox
Poster,Thought of Search: Planning with Language Models Through The Lens of Efficiency,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93837,"Michael Katz, Harsha Kokel, Kavitha Srinivas, Shirin Sohrabi Araghi","Among the most important properties of algorithms investigated in computer science are soundness, completeness, and complexity. These properties, however, are rarely analyzed for the vast collection of recently proposed methods for planning with large language models. In this work, we alleviate this gap. We analyse these properties of using LLMs for planning and highlight that recent trends abandon both soundness and completeness for the sake of inefficiency. We propose a significantly more efficient approach that can, at the same time, maintain both soundness and completeness. We exemplify on four representative search problems, comparing to the LLM-based solutions from the literature that attempt to solve these problems. We show that by using LLMs to produce the code for the search components we can solve the entire datasets with 100% accuracy with only a few calls to the LLM. In contrast, the compared approaches require hundreds of thousands of calls and achieve significantly lower accuracy. We argue for a responsible use of compute resources; urging research community to investigate sound and complete LLM-based approaches that uphold efficiency."
Poster,Tight Bounds for Learning RUMs from Small Slates,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96908,"Flavio Chierichetti, Mirko Giacchini, Ravi Kumar, Alessandro Panconesi, Andrew Tomkins","A Random Utility Model (RUM) is a classical model of user behavior defined by a distribution over $\mathbb{R}^n$. A user, presented with a subset of $\\{1,\ldots,n\\}$, will select the item of the subset with the highest utility, according to a utility vector drawn from the specified distribution. In practical settings, the subset is often of small size, as in the ``ten blue links'' of web search. In this paper, we consider a learning setting with complete information on user choices from subsets of size at most $k$. We show that $k=\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ is both necessary and sufficient to predict the distribution of all user choices with an arbitrarily small, constant error.Based on the upper bound, we obtain new algorithms for approximate RUM learning and variations thereof. Furthermore, we employ our lower bound for approximate RUM learning to derive lower bounds to fractional extensions of the well-studied $k$-deck and trace reconstruction problems."
Poster,Tighter Convergence Bounds for Shuffled SGD via Primal-Dual Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93484,"Xufeng Cai, Cheuk Yin Lin, Jelena Diakonikolas","Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is perhaps the most prevalent optimization method in modern machine learning. Contrary to the empirical practice of sampling from the datasets \emph{without replacement} and with (possible) reshuffling at each epoch, the theoretical counterpart of SGD usually relies on the assumption of \emph{sampling with replacement}. It is only very recently that SGD using sampling without replacement -- shuffled SGD -- has been analyzed with matching upper and lower bounds. However, we observe that those bounds are too pessimistic to explain often superior empirical performance of data permutations (sampling without replacement) over vanilla counterparts (sampling with replacement) on machine learning problems. Through fine-grained analysis in the lens of primal-dual cyclic coordinate methods and the introduction of novel smoothness parameters, we present several results for shuffled SGD on smooth and non-smooth convex losses, where our novel analysis framework provides tighter convergence bounds over all popular shuffling schemes (IG, SO, and RR). Notably, our new bounds predict faster convergence than existing bounds in the literature -- by up to a factor of $O(\sqrt{n})$, mirroring benefits from tighter convergence bounds using component smoothness parameters in randomized coordinate methods. Lastly, we numerically demonstrate on common machine learning datasets that our bounds are indeed much tighter, thus offering a bridge between theory and practice."
Poster,Tight Rates for Bandit Control Beyond Quadratics,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93732,"Y. Jennifer Sun, Zhou Lu","Unlike classical control theory, such as Linear Quadratic Control (LQC), real-world control problems are highly complex. These problems often involve adversarial perturbations, bandit feedback models, and non-quadratic, adversarially chosen cost functions. A fundamental yet unresolved question is whether optimal regret can be achieved for these general control problems. The standard approach to addressing this problem involves a reduction to bandit convex optimization with memory. In the bandit setting, constructing a gradient estimator with low variance is challenging due to the memory structure and non-quadratic loss functions.In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to this question. Our main contribution is an algorithm that achieves an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ optimal regret for bandit non-stochastic control with strongly-convex and smooth cost functions in the presence of adversarial perturbations, improving the previously known $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret bound from \citep{cassel2020bandit}. Our algorithm overcomes the memory issue by reducing the problem to Bandit Convex Optimization (BCO) without memory and addresses general strongly-convex costs using recent advancements in BCO from \citep{suggala2024second}. Along the way, we develop an improved algorithm for BCO with memory, which may be of independent interest."
Poster,Time-Constrained Robust MDPs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95448,"Adil Zouitine, David Bertoin, Pierre Clavier, Matthieu Geist, Emmanuel Rachelson","Robust reinforcement learning is essential for deploying reinforcement learning algorithms in real-world scenarios where environmental uncertainty predominates.Traditional robust reinforcement learning often depends on rectangularity assumptions, where adverse probability measures of outcome states are assumed to be independent across different states and actions. This assumption, rarely fulfilled in practice, leads to overly conservative policies. To address this problem, we introduce a new time-constrained robust MDP (TC-RMDP) formulation that considers multifactorial, correlated, and time-dependent disturbances, thus more accurately reflecting real-world dynamics. This formulation goes beyond the conventional rectangularity paradigm, offering new perspectives and expanding the analytical framework for robust RL.We propose three distinct algorithms, each using varying levels of environmental information, and evaluate them extensively on continuous control benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that these algorithms yield an efficient tradeoff between performance and robustness, outperforming traditional deep robust RL methods in time-constrained environments while preserving robustness in classical benchmarks.This study revisits the prevailing assumptions in robust RL and opens new avenues for developing more practical and realistic RL applications."
Poster,Time-FFM: Towards LM-Empowered Federated Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95835,"Qingxiang Liu, Xu Liu, Chenghao Liu, Qingsong Wen, Yuxuan Liang","Unlike natural language processing and computer vision, the development of Foundation Models (FMs) for time series forecasting is blocked due to data scarcity. While recent efforts are focused on building such FMs by unlocking the potential of language models (LMs) for time series analysis, dedicated parameters for various downstream forecasting tasks need training, which hinders the common knowledge sharing across domains.Moreover, data owners may hesitate to share the access to local data due to privacy concerns and copyright protection, which makes it impossible to simply construct a FM on cross-domain training instances.To address these issues, we propose Time-FFM, a Federated Foundation Model for Time series forecasting by leveraging pretrained LMs.Specifically, we begin by transforming time series into the modality of text tokens.To bootstrap LMs for time series reasoning, we propose a prompt adaption module to determine domain-customized prompts dynamically instead of artificially.Given the data heterogeneity across domains, we design a personalized federated training strategy by learning global encoders and local prediction heads. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that Time-FFM outperforms state-of-the-arts and promises effective few-shot and zero-shot forecaster.The code is available at https://github.com/CityMind-Lab/NeurIPS24-Time-FFM/tree/main."
