Poster,Adam with model exponential moving average is effective for nonconvex optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93230,"Kwangjun Ahn, Ashok Cutkosky","In this work, we offer a theoretical analysis of two modern optimization techniques for training large and complex models: (i) adaptive optimization algorithms, such as Adam, and (ii) the model exponential moving average (EMA). Specifically, we demonstrate that a clipped version of Adam with model EMA achieves the optimal convergence rates in various nonconvex optimization settings, both smooth and nonsmooth. Moreover, when the scale varies significantly across different coordinates, we demonstrate that the coordinate-wise adaptivity of Adam is provably advantageous. Notably, unlike previous analyses of Adam, our analysis crucially relies on its core elements---momentum and discounting factors---as well as model EMA, motivating their wide applications in practice."
Poster,AdanCA: Neural Cellular Automata As Adaptors For More Robust Vision Transformer,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96193,"Yitao Xu, Tong Zhang, Sabine Süsstrunk","Vision Transformers (ViTs) demonstrate remarkable performance in image classification through visual-token interaction learning, particularly when equipped with local information via region attention or convolutions. Although such architectures improve the feature aggregation from different granularities, they often fail to contribute to the robustness of the networks. Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) enables the modeling of global visual-token representations through local interactions, with its training strategies and architecture design conferring strong generalization ability and robustness against noisy input. In this paper, we propose Adaptor Neural Cellular Automata (AdaNCA) for Vision Transformers that uses NCA as plug-and-play adaptors between ViT layers, thus enhancing ViT's performance and robustness against adversarial samples as well as out-of-distribution inputs. To overcome the large computational overhead of standard NCAs, we propose Dynamic Interaction for more efficient interaction learning. Using our analysis of AdaNCA placement and robustness improvement, we also develop an algorithm for identifying the most effective insertion points for AdaNCA. With less than a 3% increase in parameters, AdaNCA contributes to more than 10% absolute improvement in accuracy under adversarial attacks on the ImageNet1K benchmark. Moreover, we demonstrate with extensive evaluations across eight robustness benchmarks and four ViT architectures that AdaNCA, as a plug-and-play module, consistently improves the robustness of ViTs."
Poster,AdaNeg: Adaptive Negative Proxy Guided OOD Detection with Vision-Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93203,"Yabin Zhang, Lei Zhang","Recent research has shown that pre-trained vision-language models are effective at identifying out-of-distribution (OOD) samples by using negative labels as guidance. However, employing consistent negative labels across different OOD datasets often results in semantic misalignments, as these text labels may not accurately reflect the actual space of OOD images. To overcome this issue, we introduce \textit{adaptive negative proxies}, which are dynamically generated during testing by exploring actual OOD images, to align more closely with the underlying OOD label space and enhance the efficacy of negative proxy guidance. Specifically, our approach utilizes a feature memory bank to selectively cache discriminative features from test images, representing the targeted OOD distribution. This facilitates the creation of proxies that can better align with specific OOD datasets. While task-adaptive proxies average features to reflect the unique characteristics of each dataset, the sample-adaptive proxies weight features based on their similarity to individual test samples, exploring detailed sample-level nuances. The final score for identifying OOD samples integrates static negative labels with our proposed adaptive proxies, effectively combining textual and visual knowledge for enhanced performance. Our method is training-free and annotation-free, and it maintains fast testing speed. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, abbreviated as AdaNeg. Notably, on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark, our AdaNeg significantly outperforms existing methods, with a 2.45\% increase in AUROC and a 6.48\% reduction in FPR95.

Poster,AdaNovo: Towards Robust \emph{De Novo} Peptide Sequencing in Proteomics against Data Biases,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96894,"Jun Xia, Shaorong Chen, Jingbo Zhou, Shan Xiaojun, Wenjie Du, Zhangyang Gao, Cheng Tan, Bozhen Hu, Jiangbin Zheng, Stan Z. Li","Tandem mass spectrometry has played a pivotal role in advancing proteomics, enabling the high-throughput analysis of protein composition in biological tissues. Despite the development of several deep learning methods for predicting amino acid sequences (peptides) responsible for generating the observed mass spectra, training data biases hinder further advancements of \emph{de novo} peptide sequencing. Firstly, prior methods struggle to identify amino acids with Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) due to their lower frequency in training data compared to canonical amino acids, further resulting in unsatisfactory peptide sequencing performance. Secondly, various noise and missing peaks in mass spectra reduce the reliability of training data (Peptide-Spectrum Matches, PSMs). To address these challenges, we propose AdaNovo, a novel and domain knowledge-inspired framework that calculates Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) between the mass spectra and amino acids or peptides, using CMI for robust training against above biases. Extensive experiments indicate that AdaNovo outperforms previous competitors on the widely-used 9-species benchmark, meanwhile yielding 3.6\% - 9.4\% improvements in PTMs identification. The supplements contain the code."
Poster,AdaPKC: PeakConv with Adaptive Peak Receptive Field for Radar Semantic Segmentation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93633,"Teng Li, Liwen Zhang, Youcheng Zhang, ZijunHu, Pengcheng Pi, Zongqing Lu, Qingmin Liao, Zhe Ma","Deep learning-based radar detection technology is receiving increasing attention in areas such as autonomous driving, UAV surveillance, and marine monitoring. Among recent efforts, PeakConv (PKC) provides a solution that can retain the peak response characteristics of radar signals and play the characteristics of deep convolution, thereby improving the effect of radar semantic segmentation (RSS). However, due to the use of a pre-set fixed peak receptive field sampling rule, PKC still has limitations in dealing with problems such as inconsistency of target frequency domain response broadening, non-homogeneous and time-varying characteristic of noise/clutter distribution. Therefore, this paper proposes an idea of adaptive peak receptive field, and upgrades PKC to AdaPKC based on this idea. Beyond that, a novel fine-tuning technology to further boost the performance of AdaPKC-based RSS networks is presented. Through experimental verification using various real-measured radar data (including publicly available low-cost millimeter-wave radar dataset for autonomous driving and self-collected Ku-band surveillance radar dataset), we found that the performance of AdaPKC-based models surpasses other SoTA methods in RSS tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/lihua199710/AdaPKC."
Poster,Adaptable Logical Control for Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96610,"Honghua Zhang, Po-Nien Kung, Masahiro Yoshida, Guy Van den Broeck, Nanyun Peng","Despite the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) on various tasks following human instructions, controlling model generation to follow strict constraints at inference time poses a persistent challenge. In this paper, we introduce Ctrl-G, a neuro-symbolic framework that enables tractable and adaptable control of LLM generation to follow logical constraints reliably. Ctrl-G combines any production-ready LLM with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), guiding LLM outputs to adhere to logical constraints represented as deterministic finite automata. We show that Ctrl-G, when a TULU2-7B model is coupled with a 2B-parameter HMM, outperforms GPT4 in text editing: on the task of generating text insertions/continuations following logical constraints, our approach achieves over 30% higher satisfaction rate in human evaluation. When applied to medium-size language models (e.g., GPT2-large), Ctrl-G also beats its counterparts on standard benchmarks by large margins. Additionally, as a proof-of-concept study, we use Ctrl-G to assist LLM reasoning on the GSM benchmark, foreshadowing the application of Ctrl-G, as well as other constrained generation approaches, beyond traditional language generation tasks."
Poster,Adapting Diffusion Models for Improved Prompt Compliance and Controllable Image Synthesis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93374,"Deepak Sridhar, Abhishek Peri, Rohith Rachala, Nuno Vasconcelos","Recent advances in generative modeling with diffusion processes (DPs) enabled breakthroughs in image synthesis. Despite impressive image quality, these models have various prompt compliance problems, including low recall in generating multiple objects, difficulty in generating text in images, and meeting constraints like object locations and pose. For fine-grained editing and manipulation, they also require fine-grained semantic or instance maps that are tedious to produce manually. While prompt compliance can be enhanced by addition of loss functions at inference, this is time consuming and does not scale to complex scenes.   To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a new family of  $\textit{Factor Graph Diffusion Models}$ (FG-DMs) that models the joint distribution of images and conditioning variables, such as semantic, sketch, depth or normal maps via a factor graph decomposition. This joint structure has several advantages, including support for efficient sampling based prompt compliance schemes, which produce images of high object recall, semi-automated fine-grained editing, explainability at intermediate levels, ability to produce labeled datasets for the training of downstream models such as segmentation or depth, training with missing data, and continual learning where new conditioning variables can be added with minimal or no modifications to the existing structure. We propose an implementation of FG-DMs by adapting a pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) model to implement all FG-DM factors, using only COCO dataset, and show that it is effective in generating images with 15\% higher recall than SD while retaining its generalization ability. We introduce an attention distillation loss that encourages consistency among the attention maps of all factors, improving the fidelity of the generated conditions and image. We also show that training FG-DMs from scratch on MM-CelebA-HQ, Cityscapes, ADE20K, and COCO produce images of high quality (FID) and diversity (LPIPS)."
Poster,Adapting to Unknown Low-Dimensional Structures in Score-Based Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95079,"Gen Li, Yuling Yan","This paper investigates score-based diffusion models when the underlying target distribution is concentrated on or near low-dimensional manifolds within the higher-dimensional space in which they formally reside, a common characteristic of natural image distributions. Despite previous efforts to understand the data generation process of diffusion models, existing theoretical support remains highly suboptimal in the presence of low-dimensional structure, which we strengthen in this paper.  For the popular Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), we find that the dependency of the error incurred within each denoising step on the ambient dimension $d$ is in general unavoidable. We further identify a unique design of coefficients that yields a converges rate at the order of $O(k^{2}/\sqrt{T})$ (up to log factors), where $k$ is the intrinsic dimension of the target distribution and $T$ is the number of steps. This represents the first theoretical demonstration that the DDPM sampler can adapt to unknown low-dimensional structures in the target distribution, highlighting the critical importance of coefficient design. All of this is achieved by a novel set of analysis tools that characterize the algorithmic dynamics in a more deterministic manner."
Poster,Adaptive $Q$-Aid for Conditional Supervised Learning in Offline Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96757,"Jeonghye Kim, Suyoung Lee, Woojun Kim, Youngchul Sung","Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has progressed with return-conditioned supervised learning (RCSL), but its lack of stitching ability remains a limitation. We introduce $Q$-Aided Conditional Supervised Learning (QCS), which effectively combines the stability of RCSL with the stitching capability of $Q$-functions. By analyzing $Q$-function over-generalization, which impairs stable stitching, QCS adaptively integrates $Q$-aid into RCSL's loss function based on trajectory return. Empirical results show that QCS significantly outperforms RCSL and value-based methods, consistently achieving or exceeding the highest trajectory returns across diverse offline RL benchmarks. QCS represents a breakthrough in offline RL, pushing the limits of what can be achieved and fostering further innovations."
Poster,Adaptive and Optimal Second-order Optimistic Methods for Minimax Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95432,"Ruichen Jiang, Ali Kavis, Qiujiang Jin, Sujay Sanghavi, Aryan Mokhtari","We propose adaptive, line-search-free second-order methods with optimal rate of convergence for solving convex-concave min-max problems. By means of an adaptive step size, our algorithms feature a simple update rule that requires solving only one linear system per iteration, eliminating the need for line-search or backtracking mechanisms. Specifically, we base our algorithms on the optimistic method and appropriately combine it with second-order information. Moreover, distinct from common adaptive schemes, we define the step size recursively as a function of the gradient norm and the prediction error in the optimistic update. We first analyze a variant where the step size requires knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of the Hessian. Under the additional assumption of Lipschitz continuous gradients, we further design a parameter-free version by tracking the Hessian Lipschitz constant locally and ensuring the iterates remain bounded. We also evaluate the practical performance of our algorithm by comparing it to existing second-order algorithms for minimax optimization."
