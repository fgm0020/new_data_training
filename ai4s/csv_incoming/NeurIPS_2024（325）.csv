Poster,QGFN: Controllable Greediness with Action Values,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93895,"Elaine Lau, Stephen Lu, Ling Pan, Doina Precup, Emmanuel Bengio","Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets; GFNs) are a family of energy-based generative methods for combinatorial objects, capable of generating diverse and high-utility samples. However, consistently biasing GFNs towards producing high-utility samples is non-trivial. In this work, we leverage connections between GFNs and reinforcement learning (RL) and propose to combine the GFN policy with an action-value estimate, $Q$, to create greedier sampling policies which can be controlled by a mixing parameter. We show that several variants of the proposed method, QGFN, are able to improve on the number of high-reward samples generated in a variety of tasks without sacrificing diversity."
Poster,QGym: Scalable Simulation and Benchmarking of Queuing Network Controllers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97467,"Haozhe Chen, Ang Li, Ethan Che, Jing Dong, Tianyi Peng, Hongseok Namkoong","Queuing network control allows allocation of  scarce resources to manage congestion, a fundamental problem in manufacturing, communications, and healthcare. Compared to standard RL problems, queueing problems  are distinguished by unique challenges: i) a system operating in continuous time, ii) high stochasticity, and iii) long horizons over which the system can become unstable (exploding delays). To provide the empirical foundations for methodological development tackling these challenges, we present an open-sourced  queueing simulation framework, QGym, that benchmark queueing policies across realistic problem instances. Our modular framework allows the researchers to build on our initial instances, which provide a wide range of environments including parallel servers, criss-cross, tandem, and re-entrant networks, as well as a realistically calibrated hospital queuing system.  From these, various policies can be easily tested, including both model-free RL methods and classical queuing policies. Our testbed significantly expands the scope of empirical benchmarking in prior work, and complements thetraditional focus on evaluating algorithms based on mathematical guarantees in idealized settings. QGym code is open-sourced at https://github.com/namkoong-lab/QGym."
Poster,QKFormer: Hierarchical Spiking Transformer using Q-K Attention,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96252,"chenlin zhou, Han Zhang, Zhaokun Zhou, Liutao Yu, Liwei Huang, Xiaopeng Fan, Li Yuan, Zhengyu Ma, Huihui Zhou, Yonghong Tian","Spiking Transformers, which integrate Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with Transformer architectures, have attracted significant attention due to their potential for low energy consumption and high performance. However, there remains a substantial gap in performance between SNNs and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). To narrow this gap, we have developed QKFormer, a direct training spiking transformer with the following features: i) _Linear complexity and high energy efficiency_, the novel spike-form Q-K attention module efficiently models the token or channel attention through binary vectors and enables the construction of larger models. ii) _Multi-scale spiking representation_, achieved by a hierarchical structure with the different numbers of tokens across blocks. iii) _Spiking Patch Embedding with Deformed Shortcut (SPEDS)_, enhances spiking information transmission and integration, thus improving overall performance. It is shown that QKFormer achieves significantly superior performance over existing state-of-the-art SNN models on various mainstream datasets. Notably, with comparable size to Spikformer (66.34 M, 74.81\%), QKFormer (64.96 M) achieves a groundbreaking top-1 accuracy of **85.65\%** on ImageNet-1k, substantially outperforming Spikformer by **10.84\%**. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that directly training SNNs have exceeded 85\% accuracy on ImageNet-1K."
Poster,QTIP: Quantization with Trellises and Incoherence Processing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96418,"Albert Tseng, Qingyao Sun, David Hou, Christopher De Sa","Post-training quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint of LLMs by quantizing weights to low-precision datatypes.Since LLM inference is usually memory-bound, PTQ methods can improve inference throughput.Recent state-of-the-art PTQ approaches use vector quantization (VQ) to quantize multiple weights at once, which improves information utilization through better shaping.However, VQ requires a codebook with size exponential in the dimension.This limits current VQ-based PTQ works to low VQ dimensions ($\le 8$) that in turn limit quantization quality.Here, we introduce QTIP, which instead uses trellis coded quantization (TCQ) to achieve ultra-high-dimensional quantization. TCQ uses a stateful decoder that separates the codebook size from the bitrate and effective dimension. QTIP introduces a spectrum of lookup-only to computed lookup-free trellis codes designed for a hardware-efficient ""bitshift"" trellis structure; these codes achieve state-of-the-art results in both quantization quality and inference speed."
Poster,QT-ViT: Improving Linear Attention in ViT with Quadratic Taylor Expansion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94928,"Yixing Xu, Chao Li, Dong Li, Xiao Sheng, Fan Jiang, Lu Tian, Emad Barsoum","Vision transformer model (ViT) is widely used and performs well in vision tasks due to its ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, the time complexity and memory consumption increase quadratically with the number of input patches which limits the usage of ViT in real-world applications. Previous methods have employed linear attention to mitigate the complexity of the original self-attention mechanism at the expense of effectiveness. In this paper, we propose QT-ViT models that improve the previous linear self-attention using quadratic Taylor expansion. Specifically, we substitute the softmax-based attention with second-order Taylor expansion, and then accelerate the quadratic expansion by reducing the time complexity with a fast approximation algorithm. The proposed method capitalizes on the property of quadratic expansion to achieve superior performance while employing linear approximation for fast inference. Compared to previous studies of linear attention, our approach does not necessitate knowledge distillation or high-order attention residuals to facilitate the training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed QT-ViTs, showcasing the state-of-the-art results. Particularly, the proposed QT-ViTs consistently surpass the previous SOTA EfficientViTs under different model sizes, and achieve a new Pareto-front in terms of accuracy and speed."
Poster,QuadMamba: Learning Quadtree-based Selective Scan for Visual State Space Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95009,"Fei Xie, Weijia Zhang, Zhongdao Wang, Chao Ma","Recent advancements in State Space Models, notably Mamba, have demonstrated superior performance over the dominant Transformer models, particularly in reducing the computational complexity from quadratic to linear. Yet, difficulties in adapting Mamba from language to vision tasks arise due to the distinct characteristics of visual data, such as the spatial locality and adjacency within images and large variations in information granularity across visual tokens. Existing vision Mamba approaches either flatten tokens into sequences in a raster scan fashion, which breaks the local adjacency of images, or manually partition tokens into windows, which limits their long-range modeling and generalization capabilities. To address these limitations, we present a new vision Mamba model, coined QuadMamba, that effectively captures local dependencies of varying granularities via quadtree-based image partition and scan. Concretely, our lightweight quadtree-based scan module learns to preserve the 2D locality of spatial regions within learned window quadrants. The module estimates the locality score of each token from their features, before adaptively partitioning tokens into window quadrants. An omnidirectional window shifting scheme is also introduced to capture more intact and informative features across different local regions. To make the discretized quadtree partition end-to-end trainable, we further devise a sequence masking strategy based on Gumbel-Softmax and its straight-through gradient estimator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in various vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Our code and models will be released."
Poster,Quadratic Quantum Variational Monte Carlo,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93844,"Baiyu Su, Qiang Liu","This paper introduces the Quadratic Quantum Variational Monte Carlo (Q$^2$VMC) algorithm, an innovative algorithm in quantum chemistry that significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of solving the Schrödinger equation. Inspired by the discretization of imaginary-time Schrödinger evolution, Q$^2$VMC employs a novel quadratic update mechanism that integrates seamlessly with neural network-based ansatzes. Our extensive experiments showcase Q$^2$VMC's superior performance, achieving faster convergence and lower ground state energies in wavefunction optimization across various molecular systems, without additional computational cost. This study not only advances the field of computational quantum chemistry but also highlights the important role of discretized evolution in variational quantum algorithms, offering a scalable and robust framework for future quantum research."
Poster,Qualitative Mechanism Independence,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95189,"Oliver Richardson, Spencer J Peters, Joseph Halpern","We define what it means for a joint probability distribution to be compatible with aset of independent causal mechanisms, at a qualitative level—or, more precisely with a directed hypergraph $\mathcal A$, which is the qualitative structure of a probabilistic dependency graph (PDG). When A represents a qualitative Bayesian network, QIM-compatibility with $\mathcal A$ reduces to satisfying the appropriate conditional independencies. But giving semantics to hypergraphs using QIM-compatibility lets us do much more. For one thing, we can capture functional dependencies. For another, we can capture important aspects of causality using compatibility: we can use compatibility to understand cyclic causal graphs, and to demonstrate structural compatibility, we must essentially produce a causal model. Finally, compatibility has deep connections to information theory. Applying compatibility to cyclic structures helps to clarify a longstanding conceptual issue in information theory."
Poster,Quality-Improved and Property-Preserved Polarimetric Imaging via Complementarily Fusing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93761,"Chu Zhou, Yixing Liu, Chao Xu, Boxin Shi","Polarimetric imaging is a challenging problem in the field of polarization-based vision, since setting a short exposure time reduces the signal-to-noise ratio, making the degree of polarization (DoP) and the angle of polarization (AoP) severely degenerated, while if setting a relatively long exposure time, the DoP and AoP would tend to be over-smoothed due to the frequently-occurring motion blur. This work proposes a polarimetric imaging framework that can produce clean and clear polarized snapshots by complementarily fusing a degraded pair of noisy and blurry ones. By adopting a neural network-based three-phase fusing scheme with specially-designed modules tailored to each phase, our framework can not only improve the image quality but also preserve the polarization properties. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance."
Poster,QuanTA: Efficient High-Rank Fine-Tuning of LLMs with Quantum-Informed Tensor Adaptation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96019,"Zhuo Chen, Rumen Dangovski, Charlotte Loh, Owen Dugan, Di Luo, Marin Soljacic","We propose **Quan**tum-informed **T**ensor **A**daptation (**QuanTA**), a novel, easy-to-implement, fine-tuning method with no inference overhead for large-scale pre-trained language models. By leveraging quantum-inspired methods derived from quantum circuit structures, QuanTA enables efficient *high-rank* fine-tuning, surpassing the limitations of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)---low-rank approximation may fail for complicated downstream tasks. Our approach is theoretically supported by the universality theorem and the rank representation theorem to achieve efficient high-rank adaptations. Experiments demonstrate that QuanTA significantly enhances commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, and scalability compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, QuanTA shows superior performance with fewer trainable parameters compared to other approaches and can be designed to integrate with existing fine-tuning algorithms for further improvement, providing a scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning large language models and advancing state-of-the-art in natural language processing."
