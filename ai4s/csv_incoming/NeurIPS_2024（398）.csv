Poster,Text-space Graph Foundation Models: Comprehensive Benchmarks and New Insights,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97704,"Zhikai Chen, Haitao Mao, Jingzhe Liu, Yu Song, Bingheng Li, Wei Jin, Bahare Fatemi, Anton Tsitsulin, Bryan Perozzi, Hui Liu, Jiliang Tang","Given the ubiquity of graph data and its applications in diverse domains, building a Graph Foundation Model (GFM) that can work well across different graphs and tasks with a unified backbone has recently garnered significant interests. A major obstacle to achieving this goal stems from the fact that graphs from different domains often exhibit diverse node features. Inspired by multi-modal models that align different modalities with natural language, the text has recently been adopted to provide a unified feature space for diverse graphs. Despite the great potential of these text-space GFMs, current research in this field is hampered by two problems. First, the absence of a comprehensive benchmark with unified problem settings hinders a clear understanding of the comparative effectiveness and practical value of different text-space GFMs. Second, there is a lack of sufficient datasets to thoroughly explore the methods' full potential and verify their effectiveness across diverse settings. To address these issues, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark providing novel text-space datasets and comprehensive evaluation under unified problem settings. Empirical results provide new insights and inspire future research directions. Our code and data are publicly available from https://github.com/CurryTang/TSGFM."
Poster,Text to Blind Motion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97700,"Hee Jae Kim, Kathakoli Sengupta, Masaki Kuribayashi, Hernisa Kacorri, Eshed Ohn-Bar","People who are blind perceive the world differently than those who are sighted, which can result in distinct motion characteristics. For instance, when crossing at an intersection, blind individuals may have different patterns of movement, such as veering more from a straight path or using touch-based exploration around curbs and obstacles. These behaviors may appear less predictable to motion models embedded in technologies such as autonomous vehicles. Yet, the ability of 3D motion models to capture such behavior has not been previously studied, as existing datasets for 3D human motion currently lack diversity and are biased toward people who are sighted. In this work, we introduce BlindWays, the first multimodal motion benchmark for pedestrians who are blind. We collect 3D motion data using wearable sensors with 11 blind participants navigating eight different routes in a real-world urban setting. Additionally, we provide rich textual descriptions that capture the distinctive movement characteristics of blind pedestrians and their interactions with both the navigation aid (e.g., a white cane or a guide dog) and the environment. We benchmark state-of-the-art 3D human prediction models, finding poor performance with off-the-shelf and pre-training-based methods for our novel task. To contribute toward safer and more reliable systems that can seamlessly reason over diverse human movements in their environments, our text-and-motion benchmark is available at https://blindways.github.io/."
Poster,Textual Training for the Hassle-Free Removal of Unwanted Visual Data: Case Studies on OOD and Hateful Image Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94785,"Saehyung Lee, Jisoo Mok, Sangha Park, Yongho Shin, Dahuin Jung, Sungroh Yoon","In our study, we explore methods for detecting unwanted content lurking in visual datasets. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that a model capable of successfully partitioning visual data can be obtained using only textual data. Based on the analysis, we propose Hassle-Free Textual Training (HFTT), a streamlined method capable of acquiring detectors for unwanted visual content, using only textual data in conjunction with pre-trained vision-language models. HFTT features an innovative objective function that significantly reduces the necessity for human involvement in data annotation. Furthermore, HFTT employs a clever textual data synthesis method, effectively emulating the integration of unknown visual data distribution into the training process at no extra cost. The unique characteristics of HFTT extend its utility beyond traditional out-of-distribution detection, making it applicable to tasks that address more abstract concepts. We complement our analyses with experiments in hateful image detection and out-of-distribution detection. Our codes are available at https://github.com/HFTT-anonymous/HFTT."
Poster,TFGDA: Exploring Topology and Feature Alignment in Semi-supervised Graph Domain Adaptation through Robust Clustering,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96831,"Jun Dan, Weiming Liu, Xie, Hua Yu, Shunjie Dong, Yanchao Tan","Semi-supervised graph domain adaptation, as a branch of graph transfer learning, aims to annotate unlabeled target graph nodes by utilizing transferable knowledge learned from a label-scarce source graph. However, most existing studies primarily concentrate on aligning feature distributions directly to extract domain-invariant features, while ignoring the utilization of the intrinsic structure information in graphs. Inspired by the significance of data structure information in enhancing models' generalization performance, this paper aims to investigate how to leverage the structure information to assist graph transfer learning. To this end, we propose an innovative framework called TFGDA. Specially, TFGDA employs a structure alignment strategy named STSA to encode graphs' topological structure information into the latent space, greatly facilitating the learning of transferable features. To achieve a stable alignment of feature distributions, we also introduce a SDA strategy to mitigate domain discrepancy on the sphere. Moreover, to address the overfitting issue caused by label scarcity, a simple but effective RNC strategy is devised to guide the discriminative clustering of unlabeled nodes. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of TFGDA over SOTA methods."
Poster,TFG: Unified Training-Free Guidance for Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95462,"Haotian Ye, Haowei Lin, Jiaqi Han, Minkai Xu, Sheng Liu, Yitao Liang, Jianzhu Ma, James Zou, Stefano Ermon","Given an unconditional diffusion model and a predictor for a target property of interest (e.g., a classifier), the goal of training-free guidance is to generate samples with desirable target properties without additional training. Existing methods, though effective in various individual applications, often lack theoretical grounding and rigorous testing on extensive benchmarks. As a result, they could even fail on simple tasks, and applying them to a new problem becomes unavoidably difficult. This paper introduces a novel algorithmic framework encompassing existing methods as special cases, unifying the study of training-free guidance into the analysis of an algorithm-agnostic design space. Via theoretical and empirical investigation, we propose an efficient and effective hyper-parameter searching strategy that can be readily applied to any downstream task. We systematically benchmark across 7 diffusion models on 16 tasks with 40 targets, and improve performance by 8.5% on average. Our framework and benchmark offer a solid foundation for conditional generation in a training-free manner."
Poster,TFS-NeRF: Template-Free NeRF for Semantic 3D Reconstruction of Dynamic Scene,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94972,"Sandika Biswas, Qianyi Wu, Biplab Banerjee, Hamid Rezatofighi","Despite advancements in Neural Implicit models for 3D surface reconstruction, handling dynamic environments with interactions between arbitrary rigid, non-rigid, or deformable entities remains challenging. The generic reconstruction methods adaptable to such dynamic scenes often require additional inputs like depth or optical flow or rely on pre-trained image features for reasonable outcomes. These methods typically use latent codes to capture frame-by-frame deformations. Another set of dynamic scene reconstruction methods, are entity-specific, mostly focusing on humans, and relies on template models. In contrast, some template-free methods bypass these requirements and adopt traditional LBS (Linear Blend Skinning) weights for a detailed representation of deformable object motions,although they involve complex optimizations leading to lengthy training times. To this end, as a remedy, this paper introduces TFS-NeRF, a template-free 3D semantic NeRF for dynamic scenes captured from sparse or single-view RGB videos, featuring interactions among two entities and more time-efficient than other LBS-based approaches. Our framework uses an Invertible Neural Network (INN) for LBS prediction, simplifying the training process. By disentangling the motions of interacting entities and optimizing per-entity skinning weights, our method efficiently generates accurate, semantically separable geometries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality reconstructions of both deformable and non-deformable objects in complex interactions, with improvedtraining efficiency compared to existing methods. The code and models will be available on our github page."
Poster,TGB 2.0: A Benchmark for Learning on Temporal Knowledge Graphs and Heterogeneous Graphs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97796,"Julia Gastinger, Shenyang Huang, Michael Galkin, Erfan Loghmani, Ali Parviz, Farimah Poursafaei, Jacob Danovitch, Emanuele Rossi, Ioannis Koutis, Heiner Stuckenschmidt, Reihaneh Rabbany, Guillaume Rabusseau","Multi-relational temporal graphs are powerful tools for modeling real-world data, capturing the evolving and interconnected nature of entities over time. Recently, many novel models are proposed for ML on such graphs intensifying the need for robust evaluation and standardized benchmark datasets. However, the availability of such resources remains scarce and evaluation faces added complexity due to reproducibility issues in experimental protocols. To address these challenges, we introduce Temporal Graph Benchmark 2.0 (TGB 2.0), a novel benchmarking framework tailored for evaluating methods for predicting future links on Temporal Knowledge Graphs and Temporal Heterogeneous Graphs with a focus on large-scale datasets, extending the Temporal Graph Benchmark. TGB 2.0 facilitates comprehensive evaluations by presenting eight novel datasets spanning five domains with up to 53 million edges. TGB 2.0 datasets are significantly largerthan existing datasets in terms of number of nodes, edges, or timestamps. In addition, TGB 2.0 provides a reproducible and realistic evaluation pipeline for multi-relational temporal graphs. Through extensive experimentation, we observe that 1) leveraging edge-type information is crucial to obtain high performance, 2) simple heuristic baselines are often competitive with more complex methods, 3) most methods fail to run on our largest datasets, highlighting the need for research on more scalable methods."
Poster,The ALCHEmist: Automated Labeling 500x CHEaper than LLM Data Annotators,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95061,"Tzu-Heng Huang, Catherine Cao, Vaishnavi Bhargava, Frederic Sala","Large pretrained models can be used as annotators, helping replace or augment crowdworkers and enabling distilling generalist models into smaller specialist models. Unfortunately, this comes at a cost: employing top-of-the-line models often requires paying thousands of dollars for API calls, while the resulting datasets are static and challenging to audit. To address these challenges, we propose a simple alternative: rather than directly querying labels from pretrained models, we task models to generate programs that can produce labels. These programs can be stored and applied locally, re-used and extended, and cost orders of magnitude less. Our system, $\textbf{Alchemist}$, obtains comparable to or better performance than large language model-based annotation in a range of tasks for a fraction of the cost: on average, improvements amount to a $\textbf{12.9}$% enhancement while the total labeling costs across all datasets are reduced by a factor of approximately $\textbf{500}\times$."
Poster,The Art of Saying No: Contextual Noncompliance in Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97587,"Faeze Brahman, Sachin Kumar, Vidhisha Balachandran, Pradeep Dasigi, Valentina Pyatkin, Abhilasha Ravichander, Sarah Wiegreffe, Nouha Dziri, Khyathi Chandu, Jack Hessel, Yulia Tsvetkov, Noah Smith, Yejin Choi, Hanna Hajishirzi","Chat-based language models are designed to be helpful, yet they should not comply with every user request. While most existing work primarily focuses on refusal of ``unsafe'' queries, we posit that the scope of noncompliance should be broadened. We introduce  a comprehensive taxonomy of contextual noncompliance describing when and how models should *not* comply with user requests. Our taxonomy spans a wide range of categories including *incomplete*, *unsupported*, *indeterminate*, and *humanizing* requests (in addition to *unsafe* requests). To test noncompliance capabilities of language models, we use this taxonomy to develop a new evaluation suite of 1000 noncompliance prompts. We find that most existing models show significantly high compliance rates in certain previously understudied categories with models like GPT-4 incorrectly complying with as many as 30\% of requests.To address these gaps, we explore different training strategies using a synthetically-generated training set of requests and expected noncompliant responses. Our experiments demonstrate that while direct finetuning of instruction-tuned models can lead to both over-refusal and a decline in general capabilities, using parameter efficient methods like low rank adapters helps to strike a good balance between appropriate noncompliance and other capabilities."
Poster,The Bayesian sampling in a canonical recurrent circuit with a diversity of inhibitory interneurons,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94903,"Eryn Sale, Wenhao Zhang","Accumulating evidence suggests stochastic cortical circuits can perform sampling-based Bayesian inference to compute the latent stimulus posterior. Canonical cortical circuits consist of excitatory (E) neurons and types of inhibitory (I) interneurons. Nevertheless, nearly no sampling neural circuit models consider the diversity of interneurons, and thus how interneurons contribute to sampling remains poorly understood. To provide theoretical insight, we build a nonlinear canonical circuit model consisting of recurrently connected E neurons and two types of I neurons including Parvalbumin (PV) and Somatostatin (SOM) neurons. The E neurons are modeled as a canonical ring (attractor) model, receiving global inhibition from PV neurons, and locally tuning-dependent inhibition from SOM neurons.We theoretically analyze the nonlinear circuit dynamics and analytically identify the Bayesian sampling algorithm performed by the circuit dynamics. We found a reduced circuit with only E and PV neurons performs Langevin sampling, and the inclusion of SOM neurons with tuning-dependent inhibition speeds up the sampling via upgrading the Langevin into Hamiltonian sampling. Moreover, the Hamiltonian framework requires SOM neurons to receive no direct feedforward connections, consistent with neuroanatomy. Our work provides overarching connections between nonlinear circuits with various types of interneurons and sampling algorithms, deepening our understanding of circuit implementation of Bayesian inference."
