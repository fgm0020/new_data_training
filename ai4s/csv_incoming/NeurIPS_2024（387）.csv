Poster,Stress-Testing Capability Elicitation With Password-Locked Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92923,"Ryan Greenblatt, Fabien Roger, Dmitrii Krasheninnikov, David Krueger","To determine the safety of large language models (LLMs), AI developers must be able to assess their dangerous capabilities. But simple prompting strategies often fail to elicit an LLM’s full capabilities. One way to elicit capabilities more robustly is to fine-tune the LLM to complete the task. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which fine-tuning-based elicitation suffices to elicit capabilities. To do this, we introduce password-locked models, LLMs fine-tuned such that some of their capabilities are deliberately hidden. Specifically, these LLMs are trained to exhibit these capabilities only when a password is present in the prompt, and to imitate a much weaker LLM otherwise. Password-locked models enable a novel method of evaluating capabilities elicitation methods, by testing whether these password-locked capabilities can be elicited without using the password. We find that a few high-quality demonstrations are often sufficient to fully elicit password-locked capabilities. More surprisingly, fine-tuning can elicit other capabilities that have been locked using the same password, or even different passwords. Furthermore, when only evaluations, and not demonstrations, are available, approaches like reinforcement learning are still often able to elicit capabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that fine-tuning is an effective method of eliciting hidden capabilities of current models but may be unreliable when high-quality demonstrations are not available, e.g., as may be the case when models’ (hidden) capabilities exceed those of human demonstrators."
Poster,Stress-Testing Long-Context Language Models with Lifelong ICL and Task Haystack,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97545,"Xiaoyue Xu, Qinyuan Ye, Xiang Ren","We introduce Lifelong ICL, a problem setting that challenges long-context language models (LMs) to learn a sequence of language tasks through in-context learning (ICL). We further introduce Task Haystack, an evaluation suite dedicated to assessing and diagnosing how long-context LMs utilizes contexts in Lifelong ICL. When given a task instruction and test inputs, long-context LMs are expectedto leverage the relevant demonstrations in the Lifelong ICL prompt, avoid distraction and interference from other tasks, and achieve test accuracies that are not significantly worse than those of the Single-task ICL baseline.Task Haystack draws inspiration from the widely-adopted “needle-in-a-haystack” (NIAH) evaluation, but presents distinct new challenges. It requires models (1) to utilize the contexts at a deeper level, rather than resorting to simple copying and pasting; (2) to navigate through long streams of evolving topics and tasks, proxying the complexities and dynamism of contexts in real-world scenarios. Additionally, Task Haystack inherits the controllability of NIAH, providing model developers with tools and visualizations to identify model vulnerabilities effectively.We benchmark 14 long-context LMs using Task Haystack, finding that frontier models like GPT-4o still struggle with the setting, failing on 15% of cases on average. Most open-weight models further lack behind by a large margin, with failure rates reaching up to 61%. In our controlled analysis, we identify factors such as distraction and recency bias as contributors to these failure cases. Further, performance declines when task instructions are paraphrased at test time or when ICL demonstrations are repeated excessively, raising concerns about the robustness, instruction understanding, and true context utilization of long-context LMs. We release our code and data to encourage future research that investigates and addresses these limitations."
Poster,Stronger Than You Think: Benchmarking Weak Supervision on Realistic Tasks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97608,"Tianyi Zhang, Linrong Cai, Jeffrey Li, Nicholas Roberts, Neel Guha, Frederic Sala","Weak supervision (WS) is a popular approach for label-efficient learning, leveraging diverse sources of noisy but inexpensive *weak labels* to automatically annotate training data. Despite its wide usage, WS and its practical value are challenging to benchmark due to the many knobs in its setup, including: data sources, labeling functions (LFs), aggregation techniques (called label models), and end model pipelines. Existing evaluation suites tend to be limited, focusing on particular components or specialized use cases. Moreover, they often involve simplistic benchmark tasks or de-facto LF sets that are suboptimally written, producing insights that may not generalize to real-world settings. We address these limitations by introducing a new benchmark, BOXWRENCH, designed to more accurately reflect *real-world usages of WS*. This benchmark features tasks with (1) higher class cardinality and imbalance, (2) notable domain expertise requirements, and (3) opportunities to re-use LFs across parallel multilingual corpora. For all tasks, LFs are written using a careful procedure aimed at mimicking real-world settings. In contrast to existing WS benchmarks, we show that supervised learning requires substantial amounts (1000+) of labeled examples to match WS in many settings."
Poster,Structural Inference of Dynamical Systems with Conjoined State Space Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93087,"Aoran Wang, Jun Pang","This paper introduces SICSM, a novel structural inference framework that integrates Selective State Space Models (selective SSMs) with Generative Flow Networks (GFNs) to handle the challenges posed by dynamical systems with irregularly sampled trajectories and partial observations. By utilizing the robust temporal modeling capabilities of selective SSMs, our approach learns input-dependent transition functions that adapt to non-uniform time intervals, thereby enhancing the accuracy of structural inference. By aggregating dynamics across diverse temporal dependencies and channeling them into the GFN, the SICSM adeptly approximates the posterior distribution of the system's structure. This process not only enables precise inference of complex interactions within partially observed systems but also ensures the seamless integration of prior knowledge, enhancing the model’s accuracy and robustness.Extensive evaluations on sixteen diverse datasets demonstrate that SICSM outperforms existing methods, particularly in scenarios characterized by irregular sampling and incomplete observations, which highlight its potential as a reliable tool for scientific discovery and system diagnostics in disciplines that demand precise modeling of complex interactions."
Poster,Structure Consistent Gaussian Splatting with Matching Prior for Few-shot Novel View Synthesis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94282,"Rui Peng, Wangze Xu, Luyang Tang, Liwei Liao, Jianbo Jiao, Ronggang Wang","Despite the substantial progress of novel view synthesis, existing methods, either based on the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or more recently 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), suffer significant degradation when the input becomes sparse. Numerous efforts have been introduced to alleviate this problem, but they still struggle to synthesize satisfactory results efficiently, especially in the large scene. In this paper, we propose SCGaussian, a Structure Consistent Gaussian Splatting method using matching priors to learn 3D consistent scene structure. Considering the high interdependence of Gaussian attributes, we optimize the scene structure in two folds: rendering geometry and, more importantly, the position of Gaussian primitives, which is hard to be directly constrained in the vanilla 3DGS due to the non-structure property. To achieve this, we present a hybrid Gaussian representation. Besides the ordinary non-structure Gaussian primitives, our model also consists of ray-based Gaussian primitives that are bound to matching rays and whose optimization of their positions is restricted along the ray. Thus, we can utilize the matching correspondence to directly enforce the position of these Gaussian primitives to converge to the surface points where rays intersect. Extensive experiments on forward-facing, surrounding, and complex large scenes show the effectiveness of our approach with state-of-the-art performance and high efficiency.

Poster,Structured flexibility in recurrent neural networks via neuromodulation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95823,"Julia Costacurta, Shaunak Bhandarkar, David Zoltowski, Scott Linderman","A core aim in theoretical and systems neuroscience is to develop models which help us better understand biological intelligence. Such models range broadly in both complexity and biological plausibility. One widely-adopted example is task-optimized recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which have been used to generate hypotheses about how the brain’s neural dynamics may organize to accomplish tasks. However, task-optimized RNNs typically have a fixed weight matrix representing the synaptic connectivity between neurons. From decades of neuroscience research, we know that synaptic weights are constantly changing, controlled in part by chemicals such as neuromodulators. In this work we explore the computational implications of synaptic gain scaling, a form of neuromodulation, using task-optimized low-rank RNNs.In our neuromodulated RNN (NM-RNN) model, a neuromodulatory subnetwork outputs a low-dimensional neuromodulatory signal that dynamically scales the low-rank recurrent weights of an output-generating RNN. In empirical experiments, we find that the structured flexibility in the NM-RNN allows it to both train and generalize with a higher degree of accuracy than low-rank RNNs on a set of canonical tasks.Additionally, via theoretical analyses we show how neuromodulatory gain scaling endows networks with gating mechanisms commonly found in artificial RNNs. We end by analyzing the low-rank dynamics of trained NM-RNNs, to show how task computations are distributed."
Poster,Structured Learning of Compositional Sequential Interventions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95943,"Jialin Yu, Andreas Koukorinis, Nicolo Colombo, Yuchen Zhu, Ricardo Silva","We consider sequential treatment regimes where each unit is exposed to combinations of interventions over time. When interventions are described by qualitative labels, such as ""close schools for a month due to a pandemic"" or ""promote this podcast to this user during this week"", it is unclear which appropriate structural assumptions allow us to generalize behavioral predictions to previously unseen combinations of interventions. Standard black-box approaches mapping sequences of categorical variables to outputs are applicable, but they rely on poorly understood assumptions on how reliable generalization can be obtained, and may underperform under sparse sequences, temporal variability, and large action spaces. To approach that,  we pose an explicit model for composition, that is, how the effect of sequential interventions can be isolated into modules, clarifying which data conditions allow for the identification of their combined effect at different units and time steps. We show the identification properties of our compositional model, inspired by advances in causal matrix factorization methods. Our focus is on predictive models for novel compositions of interventions instead of matrix completion tasks and causal effect estimation. We compare our approach to flexible but generic black-box models to illustrate how structure aids prediction in sparse data conditions."
Poster,Structured Matrix Basis for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Interpretable Dynamics,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94383,"Xiaodan Chen, Xiucheng Li, Xinyang Chen, Zhijun Li","Multivariate time series forecasting is of central importance in modern intelligent decision systems. The dynamics of multivariate time series are jointly characterized by temporal dependencies and spatial correlations. Hence, it is equally important to build the forecasting models from both perspectives. The real-world multivariate time series data often presents spatial correlations that show structures and evolve dynamically. To capture such dynamic spatial structures, the existing forecasting approaches often rely on a two-stage learning process (learning dynamic series representations and then generating spatial structures), which is sensitive to the small time-window input data and has high variance. To address this, we propose a novel forecasting model with a structured matrix basis. At its core is a dynamic spatial structure generation function whose output space is well-constrained and the generated structures have lower variance, meanwhile, it is more expressive and can offer interpretable dynamics. This is achieved via a novel structured parameterization and imposing structure regularization on the matrix basis. The resulting forecasting model can achieve up to $8.5\%$ improvements over the existing methods on six benchmark datasets, and meanwhile, it enables us to gain insights into the dynamics of underlying systems."
Poster,Structured Multi-Track Accompaniment Arrangement via Style Prior Modelling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95545,"Jingwei Zhao, Gus Xia, Ziyu Wang, Ye Wang","In the realm of music AI, arranging rich and structured multi-track accompaniments from a simple lead sheet presents significant challenges. Such challenges include maintaining track cohesion, ensuring long-term coherence, and optimizing computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel system that leverages prior modelling over disentangled style factors to address these challenges. Our method presents a two-stage process: initially, a piano arrangement is derived from the lead sheet by retrieving piano texture styles; subsequently, a multi-track orchestration is generated by infusing orchestral function styles into the piano arrangement. Our key design is the use of vector quantization and a unique multi-stream Transformer to model the long-term flow of the orchestration style, which enables flexible, controllable, and structured music generation. Experiments show that by factorizing the arrangement task into interpretable sub-stages, our approach enhances generative capacity while improving efficiency. Additionally, our system supports a variety of music genres and provides style control at different composition hierarchies. We further show that our system achieves superior coherence, structure, and overall arrangement quality compared to existing baselines."
Poster,Structured Unrestricted-Rank Matrices for Parameter Efficient Finetuning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95515,"Arijit Sehanobish, Kumar Avinava Dubey, Krzysztof M Choromanski, Somnath Basu Roy Chowdhury, Deepali Jain, Vikas Sindhwani, Snigdha Chaturvedi","Recent efforts to scale Transformer models have demonstrated rapid progress across a wide range of tasks (Wei at. al 2022). However, fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks is quite expensive due to their large parameter counts. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches have emerged as a viable alternative, allowing us to fine-tune models by updating only a small number of parameters. In this work, we propose a general framework for parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), based on *structured unrestricted-rank matrices* (SURM)  which can serve as a drop-in replacement for popular approaches such as Adapters and LoRA. Unlike other methods like LoRA, SURMs give us more flexibility in finding the right balance between compactness and expressiveness. This is achieved by using *low displacement rank matrices* (LDRMs), which hasn't been used in this context before. SURMs remain competitive with baselines, often providing significant quality improvements while using a smaller parameter budget. SURMs achieve: **5**-**7**% accuracy gains on various image classification tasks while replacing low-rank matrices in LoRA and: up to **12x** reduction of the number of parameters in adapters (with virtually no loss in quality) on the GLUE benchmark."
