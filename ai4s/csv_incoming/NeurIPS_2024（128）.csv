Poster,Einsum Benchmark: Enabling the Development of Next-Generation Tensor Execution Engines,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97464,"Mark Blacher, Christoph Staudt, Julien Klaus, Maurice Wenig, Niklas Merk, Alexander Breuer, Max Engel, Sören Laue, Joachim Giesen","Modern artificial intelligence and machine learning workflows rely on efficient tensor libraries. However, tuning tensor libraries without considering the actual problems they are meant to execute can lead to a mismatch between expected performance and the actual performance. Einsum libraries are tuned to efficiently execute tensor expressions with only a few, relatively large, dense, floating-point tensors. But, practical applications of einsum cover a much broader range of tensor expressions than those that can currently be executed efficiently. For this reason, we have created a benchmark dataset that encompasses this broad range of tensor expressions, allowing future implementations of einsum to build upon and be evaluated against. In addition, we also provide generators for einsum expressions and converters to einsum expressions in our repository, so that additional data can be generated as needed. The benchmark dataset, the generators and converters are released openly and are publicly available at https://benchmark.einsum.org."
Poster,ElasTST: Towards Robust Varied-Horizon Forecasting with Elastic Time-Series Transformer,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93264,"Jiawen Zhang, Shun Zheng, Xumeng Wen, Xiaofang Zhou, Jiang Bian, Jia Li","Numerous industrial sectors necessitate models capable of providing robust forecasts across various horizons. Despite the recent strides in crafting specific architectures for time-series forecasting and developing pre-trained universal models, a comprehensive examination of their capability in accommodating varied-horizon forecasting during inference is still lacking. This paper bridges this gap through the design and evaluation of the Elastic Time-Series Transformer (ElasTST). The ElasTST model incorporates a non-autoregressive design with placeholders and structured self-attention masks, warranting future outputs that are invariant to adjustments in inference horizons. A tunable version of rotary position embedding is also integrated into ElasTST to capture time-series-specific periods and enhance adaptability to different horizons. Additionally, ElasTST employs a multi-scale patch design, effectively integrating both fine-grained and coarse-grained information.  During the training phase, ElasTST uses a horizon reweighting strategy that approximates the effect of random sampling across multiple horizons with a single fixed horizon setting. Through comprehensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art time-series architectures and contemporary foundation models, we demonstrate the efficacy of ElasTST's unique design elements. Our findings position ElasTST as a robust solution for the practical necessity of varied-horizon forecasting."
Poster,Elliptical Attention,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96015,"Stefan Nielsen, Laziz Abdullaev, Rachel S.Y. Teo, Tan Nguyen","Pairwise dot-product self-attention is key to the success of transformers that achieve state-of-the-art performance across a variety of applications in language and vision. This dot-product self-attention computes attention weights among the input tokens using Euclidean distance, which makes the model prone to representation collapse and vulnerable to contaminated samples. In this paper, we propose using a Mahalanobis distance metric for computing the attention weights to stretch the underlying feature space in directions of high contextual relevance. In particular, we define a hyper-ellipsoidal neighborhood around each query to increase the attention weights of the tokens lying in the contextually important directions. We term this novel class of attention Elliptical Attention. Our Elliptical Attention provides two benefits: 1) reducing representation collapse and 2) enhancing the model's robustness as the Elliptical Attention pays more attention to contextually relevant information, rather than focusing on some small subset of informative features. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of Elliptical Attention over the baseline dot-product attention and state-of-the-art attention methods on various practical tasks, including object classification, imagesegmentation, and language modeling across different data modalities."
Poster,Elo Uncovered: Robustness and Best Practices in Language Model Evaluation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95297,"Meriem Boubdir, Edward Kim, Beyza Ermis, Sara Hooker, Marzieh Fadaee","In Natural Language Processing (NLP), the Elo rating system, originally designed for ranking players in dynamic games such as chess, is increasingly being used to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) through ""A vs B"" paired comparisons.However, while popular, the system's suitability for assessing entities with constant skill levels, such as LLMs, remains relatively unexplored. We study two fundamental axioms that evaluation methods should adhere to: reliability and transitivity. We conduct an extensive evaluation of Elo behavior across simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrating that individual Elo computations can exhibit significant volatility.We show that both axioms are not always satisfied, raising questions about the reliability of current comparative evaluations of LLMs.If the current use of Elo scores is intended to substitute the costly head-to-head comparison of LLMs, it is crucial to ensure the ranking is as robust as possible.Guided by the axioms, our findings offer concrete guidelines for enhancing the reliability of LLM evaluation methods, suggesting a need for reassessment of existing comparative approaches."
Poster,Elucidating the Design Space of Dataset Condensation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94518,"Shitong Shao, Zikai Zhou, Huanran Chen, Zhiqiang Shen","Dataset condensation, a concept within $\textit{data-centric learning}$, aims to efficiently transfer critical attributes from an original dataset to a synthetic version, meanwhile maintaining both diversity and realism of syntheses. This approach can significantly improve model training efficiency and is also adaptable for multiple application areas. Previous methods in dataset condensation have faced several challenges: some incur high computational costs which limit scalability to larger datasets ($\textit{e.g.,}$ MTT, DREAM, and TESLA), while others are restricted to less optimal design spaces, which could hinder potential improvements, especially in smaller datasets ($\textit{e.g.,}$ SRe$^2$L, G-VBSM, and RDED). To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive designing-centric framework that includes specific, effective strategies like implementing soft category-aware matching, adjusting the learning rate schedule and applying small batch-size. These strategies are grounded in both empirical evidence and theoretical backing. Our resulting approach, $\textbf{E}$lucidate $\textbf{D}$ataset $\textbf{C}$ondensation ($\textbf{EDC}$), establishes a benchmark for both small and large-scale dataset condensation. In our testing, EDC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reaching 48.6% on ImageNet-1k with a ResNet-18 model at an IPC of 10, which corresponds to a compression ratio of 0.78\%. This performance surpasses those of SRe$^2$L, G-VBSM, and RDED by margins of 27.3%, 17.2%, and 6.6%, respectively. Code is available at: https://github.com/shaoshitong/EDC."
Poster,Embedding-Aligned Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94829,"Guy Tennenholtz, Yinlam Chow, Chih-wei Hsu, Lior Shani, Yi Liang, Craig Boutilier","We propose a novel approach for training large language models (LLMs) to adhere to objectives defined within a latent embedding space. Our method leverages reinforcement learning (RL), treating a pre-trained LLM as an environment. Our embedding-aligned guided language (EAGLE) agent is trained to iteratively steer the LLM's generation towards optimal regions of the latent embedding space, w.r.t. some predefined criterion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the EAGLE agent using the MovieLens 25M and Amazon Review datasets to surface content gaps that satisfy latent user demand. We also demonstrate the benefit of using an optimal design of a state-dependent action set to improve EAGLE's efficiency. Our work paves the way for controlled and grounded text generation using LLMs, ensuring consistency with domain-specific knowledge and data representations."
Poster,Embedding Dimension of Contrastive Learning and $k$-Nearest Neighbors,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95861,"Dmitrii Avdiukhin, Vaggos Chatziafratis, Orr Fischer, Grigory Yaroslavtsev","We study the embedding dimension of distance comparison data in two settings: contrastive learning and $k$-nearest neighbors ($k$-NN). In both cases, the goal is to find the smallest dimension $d$ of an $\ell_p$-space in which a given dataset can be represented. We show that the arboricity of the associated graphs plays a key role in designing embeddings. Using this approach, for the most frequently used $\ell_2$-distance, we get matching upper and lower bounds in both settings.    In contrastive learning, we are given $m$ labeled samples of the form $(x_i, y_i^+, z_i^-)$ representing the fact that the positive example $y_i$ is closer to the anchor $x_i$ than the negative example $z_i$. We show that for representing such dataset in:- $\ell_2$: $d = \Theta(\sqrt{m})$ is necessary and sufficient.- $\ell_p$ for $p \ge 1$: $d = O(m)$ is sufficient and $d = \tilde \Omega(\sqrt{m})$ is necessary.- $\ell_\infty$: $d = O(m^{2/3})$ is sufficient and $d = \tilde \Omega(\sqrt{m})$ is necessary.We also give results for the more general scenario when $t$ negatives are allowed.In $k$-NN, for each of the $n$ data points we are given an ordered set of the closest $k$ points. We show that for preserving the ordering of the $k$-NN for every point in:- $\ell_2$: $d = \Theta(k)$ is necessary and sufficient.- $\ell_p$ for $p \ge 1$: $d = \tilde O(k^2)$ is sufficient and $d=\tilde \Omega(k)$ is necessary.- $\ell_\infty$ : $d = \tilde \Omega(k)$ is necessary.Furthermore, if the goal is to not just preserve the ordering of the $k$-NN but also keep them as the nearest neighbors then $d = \tilde O (\mathrm{poly}(k))$ suffices in $\ell_p$ for $p \ge 1$."
Poster,Embedding Trajectory for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Mathematical Reasoning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94059,"Yiming Wang, Pei Zhang, Baosong Yang, Derek Wong, Zhuosheng Zhang, Rui Wang","Real-world data deviating from the independent and identically distributed (\textit{i.i.d.}) assumption of in-distribution training data poses security threats to deep networks, thus advancing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection algorithms. Detection methods in generative language models (GLMs) mainly focus on uncertainty estimation and embedding distance measurement, with the latter proven to be most effective in traditional linguistic tasks like summarization and translation. However, another complex generative scenario mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges to embedding-based methods due to its high-density feature of output spaces, but this feature causes larger discrepancies in the embedding shift trajectory between different samples in latent spaces. Hence, we propose a trajectory-based method TV score, which uses trajectory volatility for OOD detection in mathematical reasoning. Experiments show that our method outperforms all traditional algorithms on GLMs under mathematical reasoning scenarios and can be extended to more applications with high-density features in output spaces, such as multiple-choice questions."
Poster,Embodied Agent Interface: Benchmarking LLMs for Embodied Decision Making,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97552,"Manling Li, Shiyu Zhao, Qineng Wang, Kangrui Wang, Yu Zhou, Sanjana Srivastava, Cem Gokmen, Tony Lee, Erran Li Li, Ruohan Zhang, Weiyu Liu, Percy Liang, Fei-Fei Li, Jiayuan Mao, Jiajun Wu","We aim to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for embodied decision making. While a significant body of work has been leveraging LLMs for decision making in embodied environments, we still lack a systematic understanding of their performance because they are usually applied in different domains, for different purposes, and built based on different inputs and outputs. Furthermore, existing evaluations tend to rely solely on a final success rate, making it difficult to pinpoint what ability is missing in LLMs and where the problem lies, which in turn blocks embodied agents from leveraging LLMs effectively and selectively. To address these limitations, we propose a generalized interface (Embodied Agent Interface) that supports the formalization of various types of tasks and input-output specifications of LLM-based modules. Specifically, it allows us to unify 1) a broad set of embodied decision-making tasks involving both state and temporally extended goals, 2) four commonly-used LLM-based modules for decision making: goal interpretation, subgoal decomposition, action sequencing, and transition modeling, and 3) a collection of fine-grained metrics that break down evaluation into error types, such as hallucination errors, affordance errors, and various types of planning errors. Overall, our benchmark offers a comprehensive assessment of LLMs’ performance for different subtasks, pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses in LLM-powered embodied AI systems and providing insights into the effective and selective use of LLMs in embodied decision making."
Poster,EM Distillation for One-step Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93429,"Sirui Xie, Zhisheng Xiao, Diederik Kingma, Tingbo Hou, Ying Nian Wu, Kevin Murphy, Tim Salimans, Ben Poole, Ruiqi Gao","While diffusion models  can learn complex distributions, sampling requires a computationally expensive iterative process.  Existing distillation methods enable efficient sampling, but have notable limitations, such as performance degradation with very few sampling steps, reliance on training data access, or mode-seeking optimization that may fail to capture the full distribution. We propose EM Distillation (EMD), a maximum likelihood-based approach that distills a diffusion model to a one-step generator model with minimal loss of perceptual quality. Our approach is derived through the lens of Expectation-Maximization (EM), where the generator parameters are updated using samples from the joint distribution of the diffusion teacher prior and inferred generator latents. We develop a reparametrized sampling scheme and a noise cancellation technique that together stabilizes the distillation process. We further reveal an interesting connection of our method with existing methods that minimize mode-seeking KL. EMD outperforms existing one-step generative methods in terms of FID scores on ImageNet-64 and ImageNet-128, and compares favorably with prior work on distilling text-to-image diffusion models."
