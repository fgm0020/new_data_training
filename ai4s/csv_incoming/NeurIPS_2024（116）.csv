Poster,DOGS: Distributed-Oriented Gaussian Splatting for Large-Scale 3D Reconstruction  Via Gaussian Consensus,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95851,"Yu Chen, Gim Hee Lee","The recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) show promising results on the novel view synthesis (NVS) task. With its superior rendering performance and high-fidelity rendering quality, 3DGS is excelling at its previous NeRF counterparts. The most recent 3DGS method focuses either on improving the instability of rendering efficiency or reducing the model size. On the other hand, the training efficiency of 3DGS on large-scale scenes has not gained much attention. In this work, we propose DoGaussian, a method that trains 3DGS distributedly. Our method first decomposes a scene into $K$ blocks and then introduces the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) into the training procedure of 3DGS. During training, our DoGaussian maintains one global 3DGS model on the master node and $K$ local 3DGS models on the slave nodes. The $K$ local 3DGS models are dropped after training and we only query the global 3DGS model during inference. The training time is reduced by scene decomposition, and the training convergence and stability are guaranteed through the consensus on the shared 3D Gaussians. Our method accelerates the training of 3DGS by $6+$ times when evaluated on large-scale scenes while concurrently achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality. Our code is publicly available at [https://github.com/AIBluefisher/DOGS](https://github.com/AIBluefisher/DOGS)."
Poster,Doing Experiments and Revising Rules with Natural Language and Probabilistic Reasoning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95827,"Top Piriyakulkij, Cassidy Langenfeld, Tuan Anh Le, Kevin Ellis","We give a model of how to infer natural language rules by doing experiments. Themodel integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Monte Carlo algorithms forprobabilistic inference, interleaving online belief updates with experiment designunder information-theoretic criteria. We conduct a human-model comparison on aZendo-style task, finding that a critical ingredient for modeling the human data is toassume that humans also consider fuzzy, probabilistic rules, in addition to assumingthat humans perform approximately-Bayesian belief updates. We also comparewith recent algorithms for using LLMs to generate and revise hypotheses, findingthat our online inference method yields higher accuracy at recovering the trueunderlying rule, and provides better support for designing optimal experiments."
Poster,Do LLMs Build World Representations? Probing Through the Lens of State Abstraction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93786,"Zichao Li, Yanshuai Cao, Jackie CK Cheung","How do large language models (LLMs) encode the state of the world, including the status of entities and their relations, as described by a text? While existing work directly probes for a complete state of the world, our research explores whether and how LLMs abstract this world state in their internal representations. We propose a new framework for probing for world representations through the lens of state abstraction theory from reinforcement learning, which emphasizes different levels of abstraction, distinguishing between general abstractions that facilitate predicting future states and goal-oriented abstractions that guide the subsequent actions to accomplish tasks. To instantiate this framework, we design a text-based planning task, where an LLM acts as an agent in an environment and interacts with objects in containers to achieve a specified goal state. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning as well as advanced pre-training strengthens LLM-built representations' tendency of maintaining goal-oriented abstractions during decoding, prioritizing task completion over recovery of the world's state and dynamics."
Poster,Do LLMs dream of elephants (when told not to)? Latent concept association and associative memory in transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94839,"Yibo Jiang, Goutham Rajendran, Pradeep Ravikumar, Bryon Aragam","Large Language Models (LLMs) have the capacity to store and recall facts. Through experimentation with open-source models, we observe that this ability to retrieve facts can be easily manipulated by changing contexts, even without altering their factual meanings. These findings highlight that LLMs might behave like an associative memory model where certain tokens in the contexts serve as clues to retrieving facts. We mathematically explore this property by studying how transformers, the building blocks of LLMs, can complete such memory tasks. We study a simple latent concept association problem with a one-layer transformer and we show theoretically and empirically that the transformer gathers information using self-attention and uses the value matrix for associative memory."
Poster,Domain Adaptation for Large-Vocabulary Object Detectors,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94330,"Kai Jiang, Jiaxing Huang, Weiying Xie, Jie Lei, Yunsong Li, Ling Shao, Shijian Lu","Large-vocabulary object detectors (LVDs) aim to detect objects of many categories, which learn super objectness features and can locate objects accurately while applied to various downstream data. However, LVDs often struggle in recognizing the located objects due to domain discrepancy in data distribution and object vocabulary. At the other end, recent vision-language foundation models such as CLIP demonstrate superior open-vocabulary recognition capability. This paper presents KGD, a Knowledge Graph Distillation technique that exploits the implicit knowledge graphs (KG) in CLIP for effectively adapting LVDs to various downstream domains.KGD consists of two consecutive stages: 1) KG extraction that employs CLIP to encode downstream domain data as nodes and their feature distances as edges, constructing KG that inherits the rich semantic relations in CLIP explicitly; and 2) KG encapsulation that transfers the extracted KG into LVDs to enable accurate cross-domain object classification. In addition, KGD can extract both visual and textual KG independently, providing complementary vision and language knowledge for object localization and object classification in detection tasks over various downstream domains. Experiments over multiple widely adopted detection benchmarks show that KGD outperforms the state-of-the-art consistently by large margins. Codes will be released."
Poster,DomainGallery: Few-shot Domain-driven Image Generation by Attribute-centric Finetuning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94641,"Yuxuan Duan, Yan Hong, Bo Zhang, jun lan, Huijia Zhu, Weiqiang Wang, Jianfu Zhang, Li Niu, Liqing Zhang","The recent progress in text-to-image models pretrained on large-scale datasets has enabled us to generate various images as long as we provide a text prompt describing what we want. Nevertheless, the availability of these models is still limited when we expect to generate images that fall into a specific domain either hard to describe or just unseen to the models. In this work, we propose DomainGallery, a few-shot domain-driven image generation method which aims at finetuning pretrained Stable Diffusion on few-shot target datasets in an attribute-centric manner. Specifically, DomainGallery features prior attribute erasure, attribute disentanglement, regularization and enhancement. These techniques are tailored to few-shot domain-driven generation in order to solve key issues that previous works have failed to settle. Extensive experiments are given to validate the superior performance of DomainGallery on a variety of domain-driven generation scenarios."
Poster,Don't Compress Gradients in Random Reshuffling: Compress Gradient Differences,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96110,"Abdurakhmon Sadiev, Grigory Malinovsky, Eduard Gorbunov, Igor Sokolov, Ahmed Khaled, Konstantin Burlachenko, Peter Richtarik","Gradient compression is a popular technique for improving communication complexity of stochastic first-order methods in distributed training of machine learning models. However, the existing works consider only with-replacement sampling of stochastic gradients. In contrast, it is well-known in practice and recently confirmed in theory that stochastic methods based on without-replacement sampling, e.g., Random Reshuffling (RR) method, perform better than ones that sample the gradients with-replacement. In this work, we close this gap in the literature and provide the first analysis of methods with gradient compression and without-replacement sampling. We first develop a distributed variant of random reshuffling with gradient compression (Q-RR), and show how to reduce the variance coming from gradient quantization through the use of control iterates. Next, to have a better fit to Federated Learning applications, we incorporate local computation and propose a variant of Q-RR called Q-NASTYA. Q-NASTYA uses local gradient steps and different local and global stepsizes. Next, we show how to reduce compression variance in this setting as well. Finally, we prove the convergence results for the proposed methods and outline several settings in which they improve upon existing algorithms."
Poster,Don't Look Twice: Faster Video Transformers with Run-Length Tokenization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94514,"Rohan Choudhury, Guanglei Zhu, Sihan Liu, Koichiro Niinuma, Kris Kitani, László Jeni","Video transformers are slow to train due to extremely large numbers of input tokens, even though many video tokens are repeated over time. Existing methods to remove uninformative tokens either have significant overhead, negating any speedup, or require tuning for different datasets and examples. We present Run-Length Tokenization (RLT), a simple approach to speed up video transformers inspired by run-length encoding for data compression. RLT efficiently finds and removes `runs' of patches that are repeated over time before model inference, then replaces them with a single patch and a positional encoding to represent the resulting token's new length. Our method is content-aware, requiring no tuning for different datasets, and fast, incurring negligible overhead. RLT yields a large speedup in training, reducing the wall-clock time to fine-tune a video transformer by 30% while matching baseline model performance. RLT also works without training, increasing model throughput by 35% with only 0.1% drop in accuracy.RLT speeds up training at 30 FPS by more than 100%, and on longer video datasets, can reduce the token count by up to 80\%.

Poster,Doob's Lagrangian: A Sample-Efficient Variational Approach to Transition Path Sampling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95087,"Yuanqi Du, Michael Plainer, Rob Brekelmans, Chenru Duan, Frank Noe, Carla Gomes, Alan Aspuru-Guzik, Kirill Neklyudov","Rare event sampling in dynamical systems is a fundamental problem arising in the natural sciences, which poses significant computational challenges due to an exponentially large space of trajectories. For settings where the dynamical system of interest follows a Brownian motion with known drift, the question of conditioning the process to reach a given endpoint or desired rare event is definitively answered by Doob's $h$-transform. However, the naive estimation of this transform is infeasible, as it requires simulating sufficiently many forward trajectories to estimate rare event probabilities. In this work, we propose a variational formulation of Doob's $h$-transform as an optimization problem over trajectories between a given initial point and the desired ending point. To solve this optimization, we propose a simulation-free training objective with a model parameterization that imposes the desired boundary conditions by design. Our approach significantly reduces the search space over trajectories and avoids expensive trajectory simulation and inefficient importance sampling estimators which are required in existing methods. We demonstrate the ability of our method to find feasible transition paths on real-world molecular simulation and protein folding tasks."
Poster,dopanim: A Dataset of Doppelganger Animals with Noisy Annotations from Multiple Humans,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97647,"Marek Herde, Denis Huseljic, Lukas Rauch, Bernhard Sick","Human annotators typically provide annotated data for training machine learning models, such as neural networks. Yet, human annotations are subject to noise, impairing generalization performances. Methodological research on approaches counteracting noisy annotations requires corresponding datasets for a meaningful empirical evaluation. Consequently, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, dopanim, consisting of about 15,750 animal images of 15 classes with ground truth labels. For approximately 10,500 of these images, 20 humans provided over 52,000 annotations with an accuracy of circa 67%. Its key attributes include (1) the challenging task of classifying doppelganger animals, (2) human-estimated likelihoods as annotations, and (3) annotator metadata. We benchmark well-known multi-annotator learning approaches using seven variants of this dataset and outline further evaluation use cases such as learning beyond hard class labels and active learning. Our dataset and a comprehensive codebase are publicly available to emulate the data collection process and to reproduce all empirical results."
