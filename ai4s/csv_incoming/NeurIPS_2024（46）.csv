Poster,Balancing Context Length and Mixing Times for Reinforcement Learning at Scale,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94886,"Matthew Riemer, Khimya Khetarpal, Janarthanan Rajendran, Sarath Chandar","Due to the recent remarkable advances in artificial intelligence, researchers have begun to consider challenging learning problems such as learning to generalize behavior from large offline datasets or learning online in non-Markovian environments. Meanwhile, recent advances in both of these areas have increasingly relied on conditioning policies on large context lengths. A natural question is if there is a limit to the performance benefits of increasing the context length if the computation needed is available. In this work, we establish a novel theoretical result that links the context length of a policy to the time needed to reliably evaluate its performance (i.e., its mixing time) in large scale partially observable reinforcement learning environments that exhibit latent sub-task structure. This analysis underscores a key tradeoff: when we extend the context length, our policy can more effectively model non-Markovian dependencies, but this comes at the cost of potentially slower policy evaluation and as a result slower downstream learning. Moreover, our empirical results highlight the relevance of this analysis when leveraging Transformer based neural networks. This perspective will become increasingly pertinent as the field scales towards larger and more realistic environments, opening up a number of potential future directions for improving the way we design learning agents."
Poster,BAM! Just Like That: Simple and Efficient Parameter Upcycling for Mixture of Experts,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96205,"Qizhen (Irene) Zhang, Nikolas Gritsch, Dwaraknath Gnaneshwar Talupuru, Simon Guo, David Cairuz, Bharat Venkitesh, Jakob Foerster, Phil Blunsom, Sebastian Ruder, Ahmet Üstün, Acyr Locatelli","Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework has become a popular architecture for large language models due to its superior performance compared to dense models. However, training MoEs from scratch in a large-scale regime is prohibitively expensive. Previous work addresses this challenge by independently training multiple dense expert models and using them to initialize an MoE. In particular, state-of-the-art approaches initialize MoE layers using experts' feed-forward parameters while merging all other parameters, limiting the advantages of the specialized dense models when upcycling them as MoEs.  We propose BAM (Branch-Attend-Mix), a simple yet effective improvement to MoE training. BAM makes full use of specialized dense models by not only using their feed-forward network (FFN) to initialize the MoE layers but also leveraging experts' attention weights fully by leveraging them as mixture-of-attention (MoA) layers. We explore two methods for upcycling MoA layers: 1) initializing separate attention experts from dense models including key, value, and query matrices; and 2) initializing only Q projections while sharing key-value pairs across all experts to facilitate efficient inference. Our experiments using seed models ranging from 590 million to 2 billion parameters show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches under the same data and compute budget in both perplexity and downstream tasks evaluations, confirming the effectiveness of BAM."
Poster,Banded Square Root Matrix Factorization for Differentially Private Model Training,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95662,"Kalinin Nikita, Christoph Lampert","Current state-of-the-art methods for differentially private model training are based on matrix factorization techniques. However, these methods suffer from high computational overhead because they require numerically solving a demanding optimization problem to determine an approximately optimal factorization prior to the actual model training. In this work, we present a new matrix factorization approach, BSR, which overcomes this computational bottleneck. By exploiting properties of the standard matrix square root, BSR allows to efficiently handle also large-scale problems. For the key scenario of stochastic gradient descent with momentum and weight decay, we even derive analytical expressions for BSR that render the computational overhead negligible. We prove bounds on the approximation quality that hold both in the centralized and in the federated learning setting. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that models trained using BSR perform on par with the best existing methods, while completely avoiding their computational overhead."
Poster,BAN: Detecting Backdoors Activated by Adversarial Neuron Noise,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94526,"Xiaoyun Xu, Zhuoran Liu, Stefanos Koffas, Shujian Yu, Stjepan Picek","Backdoor attacks on deep learning represent a recent threat that has gained significant attention in the research community. Backdoor defenses are mainly based on backdoor inversion, which has been shown to be generic, model-agnostic, and applicable to practical threat scenarios. State-of-the-art backdoor inversion recovers a mask in the feature space to locate prominent backdoor features, where benign and backdoor features can be disentangled.  However, it suffers from high computational overhead, and we also find that it overly relies on prominent backdoor features that are highly distinguishable from benign features. To tackle these shortcomings, this paper improves backdoor feature inversion for backdoor detection by incorporating extra neuron activation information. In particular, we adversarially increase the loss of backdoored models with respect to weights to activate the backdoor effect, based on which we can easily differentiate backdoored and clean models. Experimental results demonstrate our defense, BAN, is 1.37$\times$ (on CIFAR-10) and 5.11$\times$ (on ImageNet200) more efficient with an average 9.99\% higher detect success rate than the state-of-the-art defense BTI DBF. Our code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/xiaoyunxxy/ban."
Poster,Bandit-Feedback Online Multiclass Classification: Variants and Tradeoffs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96335,"Yuval Filmus, Steve Hanneke, Idan Mehalel, Shay Moran","Consider the domain of multiclass classification within the adversarial online setting.  What is the price of relying on bandit feedback as opposed to full information? To what extent can an adaptive adversary amplify the loss compared to an oblivious one? To what extent can a randomized learner reduce the loss compared to a deterministic one? We study these questions in the mistake bound model and provide nearly tight answers.We demonstrate that the optimal mistake bound under bandit feedback is at most $O(k)$ times higher than the optimal mistake bound in the full information case, where $k$ represents the number of labels. This bound is tight and provides an answer to an open question previously posed and studied by Daniely and Helbertal ['13] and by Long ['17, '20], who focused on deterministic learners.Moreover, we present nearly optimal bounds of $\tilde{\Theta}(k)$ on the gap between randomized and deterministic learners, as well as between adaptive and oblivious adversaries in the bandit feedback setting. This stands in contrast to the full information scenario, where adaptive and oblivious adversaries are equivalent, and the gap in mistake bounds between randomized and deterministic learners is a constant multiplicative factor of $2$.In addition, our results imply that in some cases the optimal randomized mistake bound is approximately the square-root of its deterministic parallel. Previous results show that this is essentially the smallest it can get.Some of our results are proved via a reduction to prediction with expert advice under bandit feedback, a problem interesting on its own right. For this problem, we provide a randomized algorithm which is nearly optimal in some scenarios."
Poster,Bandits with Abstention under Expert Advice,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93858,"Stephen Pasteris, Alberto Rumi, Maximilian Thiessen, Shota Saito, Atsushi Miyauchi, Fabio Vitale, Mark Herbster","We study the classic problem of prediction with expert advice under bandit feedback.  Our model assumes that one action, corresponding to the learner's abstention from play, has no reward or loss on every trial. We propose the CBA (Confidence-rated Bandits with Abstentions) algorithm, which exploits this assumption to obtain reward bounds that can significantly improve those of the classical Exp4 algorithm. Our problem can be construed as the aggregation of confidence-rated predictors, with the learner having the option to abstain from play. We are the first to achieve bounds on the expected cumulative reward for general confidence-rated predictors. In the special case of specialists, we achieve a novel reward bound, significantly improving previous bounds of SpecialistExp (treating abstention as another action). We discuss how CBA can be applied to the problem of adversarial contextual bandits with the option of abstaining from selecting any action. We are able to leverage a wide range of inductive biases, outperforming previous approaches both theoretically and in preliminary experimental analysis. Additionally, we achieve a reduction in runtime from quadratic to almost linear in the number of contexts for the specific case of metric space contexts."
Poster,Bandits with Preference Feedback: A Stackelberg Game Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93162,"Barna Pásztor, Parnian Kassraie, Andreas Krause","Bandits with preference feedback present a powerful tool for optimizing unknown target functions when only pairwise comparisons are allowed instead of direct value queries. This model allows for incorporating human feedback into online inference and optimization and has been employed in systems for tuning large language models.The problem is fairly understood in toy settings with linear target functions or over finite small domains that limits practical interest.Taking the next step, we consider infinite domains and kernelized rewards. In this setting, selecting a pair of actions is quite challenging and requires balancing exploration and exploitation at two levels: within the pair, and along the iterations of the algorithm.We propose MaxMinLCB, which emulates this trade-off as a zero-sum Stackelberg game and chooses action pairs that are informative and have favorable reward values. MaxMinLCB consistently outperforms algorithms in the literature and satisfies an anytime-valid rate-optimal regret guarantee. This is owed to our novel preference-based confidence sequences for kernelized logistic estimators, which are of independent interest."
Poster,Bandits with Ranking Feedback,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94576,"Davide Maran, Francesco Bacchiocchi, Francesco Emanuele Stradi, Matteo Castiglioni, Nicola Gatti, Marcello Restelli","In this paper, we introduce a novel variation of multi-armed bandits called bandits with ranking feedback. Unlike traditional bandits, this variation provides feedback to the learner that allows them to rank the arms based on previous pulls, without quantifying numerically the difference in performance.  This type of feedback is well-suited for scenarios where the arms' values cannot be precisely measured using metrics such as monetary scores, probabilities, or occurrences. Common examples include  human preferences in matchmaking problems. Furthermore, its investigation answers the theoretical question on how numerical rewards are crucial in bandit settings. In particular, we study the problem of designing no-regret algorithms with ranking feedback both in the stochastic and adversarial settings. We show that, with stochastic rewards, differently from what happens with non-ranking feedback, no algorithm can suffer a logarithmic regret in the time horizon $T$ in the instance-dependent case. Furthermore, we provide two algorithms. The first, namely DREE, guarantees a superlogarithmic regret in $T$ in the instance-dependent case thus matching our lower bound, while the second, namely R-LPE, guarantees a regret of $\mathcal{\widetilde O}(\sqrt{T})$ in the instance-independent case. Remarkably, we show that no algorithm can have an optimal regret bound in both instance-dependent and instance-independent cases. Finally, we prove that no algorithm can achieve a sublinear regret when the rewards are adversarial."
Poster,Barely Random Algorithms and Collective Metrical Task Systems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95387,"Romain Cosson, Laurent Massoulié","We consider metrical task systems on general metric spaces with $n$ points, and show that any fully randomized algorithm can be turned into a randomized algorithm that uses only $2\log n$ random bits, and achieves the same competitive ratio up to a factor $2$. This provides the first order-optimal barely random algorithms for metrical task systems, i.e. which use a number of random bits that does not depend on the number of requests addressed to the system. We discuss implications on various aspects of online decision making such as: distributed systems, advice complexity and transaction costs, suggesting broad applicability. We put forward an equivalent view that we call collective metrical task systems where $k$ agents in a metrical task system team up, and suffer the average cost paid by each agent. Our results imply that such team can be $O(\log^2 n)$-competitive as soon as $k\geq n^2$. In comparison, a single agent is always $\Omega(n)$-competitive."
Poster,B-ary Tree Push-Pull Method is Provably Efficient for Distributed Learning on Heterogeneous Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96751,"Runze You, Shi Pu","This paper considers the distributed learning problem where a group of agents cooperatively minimizes the summation of their local cost functions based on peer-to-peer communication. Particularly, we propose a highly efficient algorithm, termed ``B-ary Tree Push-Pull'' (BTPP), that employs two B-ary spanning trees for distributing the information related to the parameters and stochastic gradients across the network. The simple method is efficient in communication since each agent interacts with at most $(B+1)$ neighbors per iteration. More importantly, BTPP achieves linear speedup for smooth nonconvex objective functions with only $\tilde{O}(n)$ transient iterations, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art results to the best of our knowledge."
