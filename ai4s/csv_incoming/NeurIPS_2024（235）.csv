Poster,LION: Linear Group RNN for 3D Object Detection in Point Clouds,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96562,"Zhe Liu, Jinghua Hou, Xinyu Wang, Xiaoqing Ye, Jingdong Wang, Hengshuang Zhao, Xiang Bai","The benefit of transformers in large-scale 3D point cloud perception tasks, such as 3D object detection, is limited by their quadratic computation cost when modeling long-range relationships. In contrast, linear RNNs have low computational complexity and are suitable for long-range modeling. Toward this goal, we propose a simple and effective window-based framework built on Linear group RNN (i.e., perform linear RNN for grouped features) for accurate 3D object detection, called LION. The key property is to allow sufficient feature interaction in a much larger group than transformer-based methods. However, effectively applying linear group RNN to 3D object detection in highly sparse point clouds is not trivial due to its limitation in handling spatial modeling. To tackle this problem, we simply introduce a 3D spatial feature descriptor and integrate it into the linear group RNN operators to enhance their spatial features rather than blindly increasing the number of scanning orders for voxel features. To further address the challenge in highly sparse point clouds, we propose a 3D voxel generation strategy to densify foreground features thanks to linear group RNN as a natural property of auto-regressive models. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed components and the generalization of our LION on different linear group RNN operators including Mamba, RWKV, and RetNet. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that our LION-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art on Waymo, nuScenes, Argoverse V2, and ONCE datasets. Last but not least, our method supports kinds of advanced linear RNN operators (e.g., RetNet, RWKV, Mamba, xLSTM and TTT) on small but popular KITTI dataset for a quick experience with our linear RNN-based framework."
Poster,Lips Are Lying: Spotting the Temporal Inconsistency between Audio and Visual in Lip-Syncing DeepFakes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93027,"Weifeng Liu, Tianyi She, Jiawei Liu, Boheng Li, Dongyu Yao, 子游 梁, Run Wang","In recent years, DeepFake technology has achieved unprecedented success in high-quality video synthesis, but these methods also pose potential and severe security threats to humanity. DeepFake can be bifurcated into entertainment applications like face swapping and illicit uses such as lip-syncing fraud. However, lip-forgery videos, which neither change identity nor have discernible visual artifacts, present a formidable challenge to existing DeepFake detection methods. Our preliminary experiments have shown that the effectiveness of the existing methods often drastically decrease or even fail when tackling lip-syncing videos.In this paper, for the first time, we propose a novel approach dedicated to lip-forgery identification that exploits the inconsistency between lip movements and audio signals. We also mimic human natural cognition by capturing subtle biological links between lips and head regions to boost accuracy. To better illustrate the effectiveness and advances of our proposed method, we create a high-quality LipSync dataset, AVLips, by employing the state-of-the-art lip generators. We hope this high-quality and diverse dataset could be well served the further research on this challenging and interesting field. Experimental results show that our approach gives an average accuracy of more than 95.3% in spotting lip-syncing videos, significantly outperforming the baselines. Extensive experiments demonstrate the capability to tackle deepfakes and the robustness in surviving diverse input transformations. Our method achieves an accuracy of up to 90.2% in real-world scenarios (e.g., WeChat video call) and shows its powerful capabilities in real scenario deployment.To facilitate the progress of this research community, we release all resources at https://github.com/AaronComo/LipFD."
Poster,LISA: Layerwise Importance Sampling for Memory-Efficient Large Language Model Fine-Tuning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95616,"Rui Pan, Xiang Liu, SHIZHE DIAO, Renjie Pi, Jipeng Zhang, Chi Han, Tong Zhang","The machine learning community has witnessed impressive advancements since large language models (LLMs) first appeared. Yet, their massive memory consumption has become a significant roadblock to large-scale training. For instance, a 7B model typically requires at least 60 GB of GPU memory with full parameter training, which presents challenges for researchers without access to high-resource environments. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been proposed to alleviate this problem. However, in most large-scale fine-tuning settings, their performance does not reach the level of full parameter training because they confine the parameter search to a low-rank subspace. Attempting to complement this deficiency, we investigate the layerwise properties of LoRA on fine-tuning tasks and observe an unexpected but consistent skewness of weight norms across different layers. Utilizing this key observation, a surprisingly simple training strategy is discovered, which outperforms both LoRA and full parameter training in a wide range of settings with memory costs as low as LoRA. We name it Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW (LISA), a promising alternative for LoRA, which applies the idea of importance sampling to different layers in LLMs and randomly freeze most middle layers during optimization. Experimental results show that with similar or less GPU memory consumption, LISA surpasses LoRA or even full parameter tuning in downstream fine-tuning tasks, where LISA consistently outperforms LoRA by over 10%-35% in terms of MT-Bench score while achieving on-par or better performance in MMLU, AGIEval and WinoGrande. On large models, specifically LLaMA-2-70B, LISA surpasses LoRA on MT-Bench, GSM8K, and PubMedQA, demonstrating its effectiveness across different domains."
Poster,Lisa: Lazy Safety Alignment for Large Language Models against Harmful Fine-tuning Attack,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95174,"Tiansheng Huang, Sihao Hu, Fatih Ilhan, Selim Tekin, Ling Liu","Recent studies show that Large Language Models (LLMs) with safety alignment can be jail-broken by fine-tuning on a dataset mixed with harmful data. For the first time in the literature, we show that the jail-break effect can be mitigated by separating two states in the fine-tuning stage to respectively optimize over the alignment and user datasets. Unfortunately, our subsequent study shows that this simple Bi-State Optimization (BSO) solution experiences convergence instability when steps invested in its alignment state is too small, leading to downgraded alignment performance. By statistical analysis, we show that the \textit{excess drift} towards the switching iterates of the two states could be a probable reason for the instability. To remedy this issue, we propose \textbf{L}azy(\textbf{i}) \textbf{s}afety \textbf{a}lignment (\textbf{Lisa}), which introduces a proximal term to constraint the drift of each state. Theoretically, the benefit of the proximal term is supported by the convergence analysis, wherein we show that a sufficient large proximal factor is necessary to guarantee Lisa's convergence.   Empirically, our results on four downstream fine-tuning tasks show that Lisa with a proximal term can significantly increase alignment performance while maintaining the LLM's accuracy on the user tasks.

Poster,Listenable Maps for Zero-Shot Audio Classifiers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93828,"Francesco Paissan, Luca Della Libera, Mirco Ravanelli, Cem Subakan","Interpreting the decisions of deep learning models, including audio classifiers, is crucial for ensuring the transparency and trustworthiness of this technology. In this paper, we introduce LMAC-ZS (Listenable Maps for Zero-Shot Audio Classifiers), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first decoder-based post-hoc explanation method for explaining the decisions of zero-shot audio classifiers. The proposed method utilizes a novel loss function that aims to closely reproduce the original similarity patterns between text-and-audio pairs in the generated explanations. We provide an extensive evaluation using the Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) model to showcase that our interpreter remains faithful to the decisions in a zero-shot classification context. Moreover, we qualitatively show that our method produces meaningful explanations that correlate well with different text prompts."
Poster,LiteVAE: Lightweight and Efficient Variational Autoencoders for Latent Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93756,"Seyedmorteza Sadat, Jakob Buhmann, Derek Bradley, Otmar Hilliges, Romann M Weber","Advances in latent diffusion models (LDMs) have revolutionized high-resolution image generation, but the design space of the autoencoder that is central to these systems remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LiteVAE, a new autoencoder design for LDMs, which leverages the 2D discrete wavelet transform to enhance scalability and computational efficiency over standard variational autoencoders (VAEs) with no sacrifice in output quality. We investigate the training methodologies and the decoder architecture of LiteVAE and propose several enhancements that improve the training dynamics and reconstruction quality. Our base LiteVAE model matches the quality of the established VAEs in current LDMs with a six-fold reduction in encoder parameters, leading to faster training and lower GPU memory requirements, while our larger model outperforms VAEs of comparable complexity across all evaluated metrics (rFID, LPIPS, PSNR, and SSIM)."
Poster,"LiT: Unifying LiDAR ""Languages"" with LiDAR Translator",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93140,"Yixing Lao, Tao Tang, Xiaoyang Wu, Peng Chen, Kaicheng Yu, Hengshuang Zhao","LiDAR data exhibits significant domain gaps due to variations in sensors, vehicles, and driving environments, creating “language barriers” that limit the effective use of data across domains and the scalability of LiDAR perception models. To address these challenges, we introduce the LiDAR Translator (LiT), a framework that directly translates LiDAR data across domains, enabling both cross-domain adaptation and multi-domain joint learning. LiT integrates three key components: a scene modeling module for precise foreground and background reconstruction, a LiDAR modeling module that models LiDAR rays statistically and simulates ray-drop, and a fast, hardware-accelerated ray casting engine. LiT enables state-of-the-art zero-shot and unified domain detection across diverse LiDAR datasets, marking a step toward data-driven domain unification for autonomous driving systems.

Poster,LIVE: Learnable In-Context Vector for Visual Question Answering,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95218,"Yingzhe Peng, chenduo hao, Xinting Hu, Jiawei Peng, Xin Geng, Xu Yang","As language models continue to scale, Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited emerging capabilities in In-Context Learning (ICL), enabling them to solve language tasks by prefixing a few in-context demonstrations (ICDs) as context. Inspired by these advancements, researchers have extended these techniques to develop Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, applying ICL usually faces two major challenges: 1) using more ICDs will largely increase the inference time and 2) the performance is sensitive to the selection of ICDs. These challenges are further exacerbated in LMMs due to the integration of multiple data types and the combinational complexity of multimodal ICDs. Recently, to address these challenges, some NLP studies introduce non-learnable In-Context Vectors (ICVs) which extract useful task information from ICDs into a single vector and then insert it into the LLM to help solve the corresponding task. However, although useful in simple NLP tasks, these non-learnable methods fail to handle complex multimodal tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA). In this study, we propose \underline{\textbf{L}}earnable \underline{\textbf{I}}n-Context \underline{\textbf{Ve}}ctor (LIVE) to distill essential task information from demonstrations, improving ICL performance in LMMs. Experiments show that LIVE can significantly reduce computational costs while enhancing accuracy in VQA tasks compared to traditional ICL and other non-learnable ICV methods."
Poster,LiveScene: Language Embedding Interactive Radiance Fields for Physical Scene Control and Rendering,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95700,"Delin Qu, Qizhi Chen, Pingrui Zhang, Xianqiang Gao, Bin Zhao, Zhigang Wang, Dong Wang, Xuelong Li","This paper scales object-level reconstruction to complex scenes, advancing interactive scene reconstruction. We introduce two datasets, OmniSim and InterReal, featuring 28 scenes with multiple interactive objects. To tackle the challenge of inaccurate interactive motion recovery in complex scenes, we propose LiveScene, a scene-level language-embedded interactive radiance field that efficiently reconstructs and controls multiple objects. By decomposing the interactive scene into local deformable fields, LiveScene enables separate reconstruction of individual object motions, reducing memory consumption. Additionally, our interaction-aware language embedding localizes individual interactive objects, allowing for arbitrary control using natural language. Our approach demonstrates significant superiority in novel view synthesis, interactive scene control, and language grounding performance through extensive experiments.

Poster,LLaMo: Large Language Model-based Molecular Graph Assistant,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94836,"Jinyoung Park, Minseong Bae, Dohwan Ko, Hyunwoo Kim","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization and instruction-following capabilities with instruction tuning. The advancements in LLMs and instruction tuning have led to the development of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, the competency of the LLMs and instruction tuning have been less explored in the molecular domain. Thus, we propose LLaMo: Large Language Model-based Molecular graph assistant, which is an end-to- end trained large molecular graph-language model. To bridge the discrepancy between the language and graph modalities, we present the multi-level graph projector that transforms graph representations into graph tokens by abstracting the output representations of each GNN layer and motif representations with the cross-attention mechanism. We also introduce machine-generated molecular graph instruction data to instruction-tune the large molecular graph-language model for general-purpose molecule and language understanding. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaMo shows the best performance on diverse tasks, such as molecular description generation, property prediction, and IUPAC name prediction. The code of LLaMo is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/LLaMo."
