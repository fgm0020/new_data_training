Poster,SCube: Instant Large-Scale Scene Reconstruction using VoxSplats,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93341,"Xuanchi Ren, Yifan Lu, hanxue liang, Jay Zhangjie Wu, Huan Ling, Mike Chen, Sanja Fidler, Francis Williams, Jiahui Huang","We present SCube, a novel method for reconstructing large-scale 3D scenes (geometry, appearance, and semantics) from a sparse set of posed images. Our method encodes reconstructed scenes using a novel representation VoxSplat, which is a set of 3D Gaussians supported on a high-resolution sparse-voxel scaffold. To reconstruct a VoxSplat from images, we employ a hierarchical voxel latent diffusion model conditioned on the input images followed by a feedforward appearance prediction model. The diffusion model generates high-resolution grids progressively in a coarse-to-fine manner, and the appearance network predicts a set of Gaussians within each voxel. From as few as 3 non-overlapping input images, SCube can generate millions of Gaussians with a 10243 voxel grid spanning hundreds of meters in 20 seconds. Past works tackling scene reconstruction from images either rely on per-scene optimization and fail to reconstruct the scene away from input views (thus requiring dense view coverage as input) or leverage geometric priors based on low-resolution models, which produce blurry results. In contrast, SCube leverages high-resolution sparse networks and produces sharp outputs from few views. We show the superiority of SCube compared to prior art using the Waymo self-driving dataset on 3D reconstruction and demonstrate its applications, such as LiDAR simulation and text-to-scene generation."
Poster,SD-Eval: A  Benchmark Dataset for Spoken Dialogue Understanding Beyond Words,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97707,"Junyi AO, Yuancheng Wang, Xiaohai Tian, Dekun Chen, Jun Zhang, Lu Lu, Yuxuan Wang, Haizhou Li, Zhizheng Wu","Speech encompasses a wealth of information, including but not limited to content, paralinguistic, and environmental information.This comprehensive nature of speech significantly impacts communication and is crucial for human-computer interaction.Chat-Oriented Large Language Models (LLMs), known for their general-purpose assistance capabilities, have evolved to handle multi-modal inputs, including speech.Although these models can be adept at recognizing and analyzing speech, they often fall short of generating appropriate responses.We argue that this is due to the lack of principles on task definition and model development, which requires open-source datasets and metrics suitable for model evaluation.To bridge the gap, we present SD-Eval, a benchmark dataset aimed at multidimensional evaluation of spoken dialogue understanding and generation.SD-Eval focuses on paralinguistic and environmental information and includes 7,303 utterances, amounting to 8.76 hours of speech data. The data is aggregated from eight public datasets, representing four perspectives: emotion, accent, age, and background sound.To assess the SD-Eval benchmark dataset, we implement three different models and construct a training set following a process similar to that of SD-Eval. The training set contains 1,052.72 hours of speech data and 724.4k utterances. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation using objective evaluation methods (e.g. BLEU and ROUGE), subjective evaluations and LLM-based metrics for the generated responses.Models conditioned with paralinguistic and environmental information outperform their counterparts in both objective and subjective measures.Moreover, experiments demonstrate that LLM-based metrics show a higher correlation with human evaluation compared to traditional metrics.We open-source SD-Eval at https://github.com/amphionspace/SD-Eval."
Poster,SDformer: Similarity-driven Discrete Transformer For Time Series Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94642,"Zhicheng Chen, FENG SHIBO, Zhong Zhang, Xi Xiao, Xingyu Gao, Peilin Zhao","The superior generation capabilities of Denoised Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have been effectively showcased across a multitude of domains. Recently, the application of DDPMs has extended to time series generation tasks, where they have significantly outperformed other deep generative models, often by a substantial margin. However, we have discovered two main challenges with these methods: 1) the inference time is excessively long; 2) there is potential for improvement in the quality of the generated time series. In this paper, we propose a method based on discrete token modeling technique called Similarity-driven Discrete Transformer (SDformer). Specifically, SDformer utilizes a similarity-driven vector quantization method for learning high-quality discrete token representations of time series, followed by a discrete Transformer for data distribution modeling at the token level. Comprehensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms competing approaches in terms of the generated time series quality while also ensuring a short inference time. Furthermore, without requiring retraining, SDformer can be directly applied to predictive tasks and still achieve commendable results."
Poster,SDP4Bit: Toward 4-bit Communication Quantization in Sharded Data Parallelism for LLM Training,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95323,"Jinda Jia, Cong Xie, Hanlin Lu, Daoce Wang, Hao Feng, Chengming Zhang, Baixi Sun, Haibin Lin, Zhi Zhang, Xin Liu, Dingwen Tao","Recent years have witnessed a clear trend towards language models with an ever-increasing number of parameters, as well as the growing training overhead and memory usage. Distributed training, particularly through Sharded Data Parallelism (ShardedDP) which partitions optimizer states among workers, has emerged as a crucial technique to mitigate training time and memory usage. Yet, a major challenge in the scalability of ShardedDP is the intensive communication of weights and gradients. While compression techniques can alleviate this issue, they often result in worse accuracy. Driven by this limitation, we propose SDP4Bit (Toward 4Bit Communication Quantization in Sharded Data Parallelism for LLM Training), which effectively reduces the communication of weights and gradients to nearly 4 bits via two novel techniques: quantization on weight differences, and two-level gradient smooth quantization. Furthermore, SDP4Bit presents an algorithm-system co-design with runtime optimization to minimize the computation overhead of compression. Additional to the theoretical guarantees of convergence, we empirically evaluate the accuracy of SDP4Bit on the pre-training of GPT models with up to 6.7 billion parameters, and the results demonstrate a negligible impact on training loss. Furthermore, speed experiments show that SDP4Bit achieves up to 4.08× speedup in end-to-end throughput on a scale of 128 GPUs."
Poster,SE(3)-bi-equivariant Transformers for Point Cloud Assembly,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96020,"Ziming Wang, Rebecka Jörnsten","Given a pair of point clouds, the goal of assembly is to recover a rigid transformation that aligns one point cloud to the other. This task is challenging because the point clouds may be non-overlapped, and they may have arbitrary initial positions. To address these difficulties, we propose a method, called $SE(3)$-bi-equivariant transformer (BITR), based on the $SE(3)$-bi-equivariance prior of the task:it guarantees that when the inputs are rigidly perturbed, the output will transform accordingly.   Due to its equivariance property, BITR can not only handle non-overlapped PCs, but also  guarantee robustness against initial positions. Specifically, BITR first extracts features of the inputs using a novel $SE(3) \times SE(3)$-transformer, and then projects the learned feature to group $SE(3)$ as the output. Moreover, we theoretically show that swap and scale equivariances can be incorporated into BITR, thus it further guarantees stable performance under scaling and swapping the inputs. We experimentally show the effectiveness of BITR in practical tasks."
Poster,SeafloorAI: A Large-scale Vision-Language Dataset for Seafloor Geological Survey,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97432,"Kien Nguyen, Fengchun Qiao, Arthur Trembanis, Xi Peng","A major obstacle to the advancements of machine learning models in marine science, particularly in sonar imagery analysis, is the scarcity of AI-ready datasets.  While there have been efforts to make AI-ready sonar image dataset publicly available, they suffer from limitations in terms of environment setting and scale.  To bridge this gap, we introduce $\texttt{SeafloorAI}$, the first extensive AI-ready datasets for seafloor mapping across 5 geological layers that is curated in collaboration with marine scientists. We further extend the dataset to $\texttt{SeafloorGenAI}$ by incorporating the language component in order to facilitate the development of both $\textit{vision}$- and $\textit{language}$-capable machine learning models for sonar imagery.  The dataset consists of 62 geo-distributed data surveys spanning 17,300 square kilometers, with 696K sonar images, 827K annotated segmentation masks, 696K detailed language descriptions and approximately 7M question-answer pairs.   By making our data processing source code publicly available, we aim to engage the marine science community to enrich the data pool and inspire the machine learning community to develop more robust models.   This collaborative approach will enhance the capabilities and applications of our datasets within both fields."
Poster,Search for Efficient Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93789,"Xuan Shen, Pu Zhao, Yifan Gong, Zhenglun Kong, Zheng Zhan, Yushu Wu, Ming Lin, Chao Wu, Xue Lin, Yanzhi Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have long held sway in the realms of artificial intelligence research.Numerous efficient techniques, including weight pruning, quantization, and distillation, have been embraced to compress LLMs, targeting memory reduction and inference acceleration, which underscore the redundancy  in LLMs.However, most model compression techniques concentrate on weight optimization, overlooking the exploration of optimal architectures.Besides, traditional architecture search methods, limited by the elevated complexity with extensive parameters, struggle to demonstrate their effectiveness on LLMs.In this paper, we propose a training-free architecture search framework to identify optimal subnets that preserve the fundamental strengths of the original LLMs while achieving inference acceleration.Furthermore, after generating subnets that inherit specific weights from the original LLMs, we introduce a reformation algorithm that utilizes the omitted weights to rectify the inherited weights  with a small amount of calibration data.Compared with SOTA training-free structured pruning works that can generate smaller networks, our method demonstrates superior performance across standard benchmarks.Furthermore, our generated subnets can directly reduce the usage of GPU memory and achieve inference acceleration."
Poster,Searching for Efficient Linear Layers over a Continuous Space of Structured Matrices,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94195,"Andres Potapczynski, Shikai Qiu, Marc Finzi, Christopher Ferri, Charlie Chen, Micah Goldblum, C. Bayan Bruss, Christopher De Sa, Andrew Wilson","Dense linear layers are the dominant computational bottleneck in large neural networks, presenting a critical need for more efficient alternatives. Previous efforts to develop alternatives have focused on a small number of hand-crafted structured matrices, and have neglected to investigate whether these structures can surpass dense layers in terms of compute-optimal scaling laws when both the model size and training examples are optimally allocated. In this work, we present a unifying framework that enables searching among all linear operators expressible via an Einstein summation. This framework encompasses many previously proposed structures, such as low-rank, Kronecker, Tensor-Train, and Monarch, along with many novel structures. We develop a taxonomy of all such operators based on their computational and algebraic properties, which provides insights into their scaling laws. Combining these insights with empirical evaluation, we identify a subset of structures that achieve equal or better performance than dense layers as a function of training compute. To further improve their compute efficiency, we develop a natural extension of these performant structures that convert them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts layer. The resulting layer significantly outperforms dense layers in compute-optimal training efficiency for GPT-2 language models."
Poster,SearchLVLMs: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Augmenting Large Vision-Language Models by Searching Up-to-Date Internet Knowledge,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93813,"Chuanhao Li, Zhen Li, Chenchen Jing, Shuo Liu, Wenqi Shao, Yuwei Wu, Ping Luo, Yu Qiao, Kaipeng Zhang","Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are ignorant of the up-to-date knowledge, such as LLaVA series, because they cannot be updated frequently due to the large amount of resources required, and therefore fail in many cases. For example, if a LVLM was released on January 2024, and it wouldn't know the singer of the theme song for the new Detective Conan movie, which wasn't released until April 2024. To solve the problem, a promising solution motivated by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is to provide LVLMs with up-to-date knowledge via internet search during inference, i.e., internet-augmented generation (IAG), which is already integrated in some closed-source commercial LVLMs such as GPT-4V. However, the specific mechanics underpinning them remain a mystery. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play framework, for augmenting existing LVLMs in handling visual question answering (VQA) about up-to-date knowledge, dubbed SearchLVLMs. A hierarchical filtering model is trained to effectively and efficiently find the most helpful content from the websites returned by a search engine to prompt LVLMs with up-to-date knowledge. To train the model and evaluate our framework's performance, we propose a pipeline to automatically generate news-related VQA samples to construct a dataset, dubbed UDK-VQA. A multi-model voting mechanism is introduced to label the usefulness of website/content for VQA samples to construct the training set. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, outperforming GPT-4o by $\sim$30\% in accuracy."
Poster,SEA: State-Exchange Attention for High-Fidelity Physics Based Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96727,"Parsa Esmati, Amirhossein Dadashzadeh, Vahid Ardakani, Nicolas Larrosa, Nicolò Grilli","Current approaches using sequential networks have shown promise in estimating field variables for dynamical systems, but they are often limited by high rollout errors. The unresolved issue of rollout error accumulation results in unreliable estimations as the network predicts further into the future, with each step's error compounding and leading to an increase in inaccuracy. Here, we introduce the State-Exchange Attention (SEA) module, a novel transformer-based module enabling information exchange between encoded fields through multi-head cross-attention. The cross-field multidirectional information exchange design enables all state variables in the system to exchange information with one another, capturing physical relationships and symmetries between fields. Additionally, we introduce an efficient ViT-like mesh autoencoder to generate spatially coherent mesh embeddings for a large number of meshing cells. The SEA integrated transformer demonstrates the state-of-the-art rollout error compared to other competitive baselines. Specifically, we outperform PbGMR-GMUS Transformer-RealNVP and GMR-GMUS Transformer, with a reduction in error of 88% and 91%, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the SEA module alone can reduce errors by 97% for state variables that are highly dependent on other states of the system.
