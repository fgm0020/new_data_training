Poster,"S$^{2}$FT: Efficient, Scalable and Generalizable LLM Fine-tuning by Structured Sparsity",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93843,"Xinyu Yang, Jixuan Leng, Geyang Guo, Jiawei Zhao, Ryumei Nakada, Linjun Zhang, Huaxiu Yao, Beidi Chen","Current PEFT methods for LLMs can achieve high quality, efficient training, or scalable serving, but not all three simultaneously.  To address this limitation, we investigate sparse fine-tuning and observe a remarkable improvement in generalization ability. Utilizing this key insight, we propose a family of Structured Sparse Fine-Tuning (S${^2}$FT) methods for LLMs, which concurrently achieve state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance, training efficiency, and inference scalability. S${^2}$FT accomplishes this by ""selecting sparsely and computing densely"". Based on the coupled structures in LLMs, \model selects a few attention heads and channels in the MHA and FFN modules for each Transformer block, respectively. Next, it co-permutes the weight matrices on both sides of all coupled structures to connect the selected subsets in each layer into a dense submatrix. Finally, S${^2}$FT performs in-place gradient updates on all selected submatrices.Through theoretical analyses and empirical results, our method prevents forgetting while simplifying optimization, delivers SOTA performance on both commonsense and arithmetic reasoning with 4.6% and 1.3% average improvements compared to LoRA, and surpasses full FT by 11.5% when generalizing to various domains after instruction tuning. Using our partial back-propagation algorithm, S${^2}$FT saves training memory up to 3$\times$ and improves latency by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to full FT, while achieving an average 10\% improvement over LoRA on both metrics. We further demonstrate that the weight updates in S${^2}$FT can be decoupled into adapters, enabling effective fusion, fast switch, and efficient parallelism when serving multiple fine-tuned models."
Poster,S2HPruner: Soft-to-Hard Distillation Bridges the Discretization Gap in Pruning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93723,"Weihao Lin, Shengji Tang, Chong Yu, Peng Ye, Tao Chen","Recently, differentiable mask pruning methods optimize the continuous relaxation architecture (soft network) as the proxy of the pruned discrete network (hard network) for superior sub-architecture search. However, due to the agnostic impact of the discretization process, the hard network struggles with the equivalent representational capacity as the soft network, namely discretization gap, which severely spoils the pruning performance. In this paper, we first investigate the discretization gap and propose a novel structural differentiable mask pruning framework named S2HPruner to bridge the discretization gap in a one-stage manner. In the training procedure, SH2Pruner forwards both the soft network and its corresponding hard network, then distills the hard network under the supervision of the soft network. To optimize the mask and prevent performance degradation, we propose a decoupled bidirectional knowledge distillation. It blocks the weight updating from the hard to the soft network while maintaining the gradient corresponding to the mask. Compared with existing pruning arts, S2HPruner achieves surpassing pruning performance without fine-tuning on comprehensive benchmarks, including CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and ImageNet with a variety of network architectures. Besides, investigation and analysis experiments explain the effectiveness of S2HPruner. Codes will be released soon."
Poster,SA3DIP: Segment Any 3D Instance with Potential 3D Priors,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96708,"Xi Yang, Xu Gu, Xingyilang Yin, Xinbo Gao","The proliferation of 2D foundation models has sparked research into adapting them for open-world 3D instance segmentation. Recent methods introduce a paradigm that leverages superpoints as geometric primitives and incorporates 2D multi-view masks from Segment Anything model (SAM) as merging guidance, achieving outstanding zero-shot instance segmentation results. However, the limited use of 3D priors restricts the segmentation performance. Previous methods calculate the 3D superpoints solely based on estimated normal from spatial coordinates, resulting in under-segmentation for instances with similar geometry. Besides, the heavy reliance on SAM and hand-crafted algorithms in 2D space suffers from over-segmentation due to SAM's inherent part-level segmentation tendency. To address these issues, we propose SA3DIP, a novel method for Segmenting Any 3D Instances via exploiting potential 3D Priors. Specifically, on one hand, we generate complementary 3D primitives based on both geometric and textural priors, which reduces the initial errors that accumulate in subsequent procedures. On the other hand, we introduce supplemental constraints from the 3D space by using a 3D detector to guide a further merging process. Furthermore, we notice a considerable portion of low-quality ground truth annotations in ScanNetV2 benchmark, which affect the fair evaluations. Thus, we present ScanNetV2-INS with complete ground truth labels and supplement additional instances for 3D class-agnostic instance segmentation. Experimental evaluations on various 2D-3D datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. Our code and proposed ScanNetV2-INS dataset are available HERE."
Poster,Safe and Efficient: A Primal-Dual Method for Offline Convex CMDPs under Partial Data Coverage,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94937,"Haobo Zhang, Xiyue Peng, Honghao Wei, Xin Liu","Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) aims to find an optimal policy using a pre-collected dataset when data collection is impractical or risky. We propose a novel linear programming (LP) based primal-dual algorithm for convex MDPs that incorporates ``uncertainty'' parameters to improve data efficiency while requiring only partial data coverage assumption. Our theoretical results achieve a sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/(1-\gamma)\sqrt{n})$ under general function approximation, improving the current state-of-the-art by a factor of $1/(1-\gamma)$, where $n$ is the number of data samples in an offline dataset, and $\gamma$ is the discount factor. The numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the practical efficacy of our approach in achieving improved safety and learning efficiency in safe offline settings."
Poster,Safe and Sparse Newton Method for Entropic-Regularized Optimal Transport,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95411,"Zihao Tang, Yixuan Qiu","Computational optimal transport (OT) has received massive interests in the machine learning community, and great advances have been gained in the direction of entropic-regularized OT. The Sinkhorn algorithm, as well as its many improved versions, has become the *de facto* solution to large-scale OT problems. However, most of the existing methods behave like first-order methods, which typically require a large number of iterations to converge. More recently, Newton-type methods using sparsified Hessian matrices have demonstrated promising results on OT computation, but there still remain a lot of unresolved open questions. In this article, we make major new progresses towards this direction: first, we propose a novel Hessian sparsification scheme that promises a strict control of the approximation error; second, based on this sparsification scheme, we develop a *safe* Newton-type method that is guaranteed to avoid singularity in computing the search directions; third, the developed algorithm has a clear implementation for practical use, avoiding most hyperparameter tuning; and remarkably, we provide rigorous global and local convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm, which is lacking in the prior literature. Various numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in solving large-scale OT problems."
Poster,Safe Exploitative Play with Untrusted Type Beliefs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95226,"Tongxin Li, Tinashe Handina, Shaolei Ren, Adam Wierman","The combination of the Bayesian game and learning has a rich history, with the idea of controlling a single agent in a system composed of multiple agents with unknown behaviors given a set of types, each specifying a possible behavior for the other agents. The idea is to plan an agent's own actions with respect to those types which it believes are most likely to maximize the payoff. However, the type beliefs are often learned from past actions and likely to be incorrect. With this perspective in mind, we consider an agent in a game with type predictions of other components, and investigate the impact of incorrect beliefs to the agent’s payoff. In particular, we formally define a tradeoff between risk and opportunity by comparing the payoff obtained against the optimal payoff, which is represented by a gap caused by trusting or distrusting the learned beliefs.Our main results characterize the tradeoff by establishing upper and lower bounds on the Pareto front for both normal-form and stochastic Bayesian games, with numerical results provided."
Poster,Safe LoRA: The Silver Lining of Reducing Safety Risks when Finetuning Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95821,"Chia-Yi Hsu, Yu-Lin Tsai, Chih-Hsun Lin, Pin-Yu Chen, Chia-Mu Yu, Chun-Ying Huang","While large language models (LLMs) such as Llama-2 or GPT-4 have shown impressive zero-shot performance, fine-tuning is still necessary to enhance their performance for customized datasets, domain-specific tasks, or other private needs. However, fine-tuning all parameters of LLMs requires significant hardware resources, which can be impractical for typical users. Therefore, parameter-efficient fine-tuning such as LoRA have emerged, allowing users to fine-tune LLMs without the need for considerable computing resources, with little performance degradation compared to fine-tuning all parameters. Unfortunately, recent studies indicate that fine-tuning can increase the risk to the safety of LLMs, even when data does not contain malicious content. To address this challenge, we propose $\textsf{Safe LoRA}$, a simple one-liner patch to the original LoRA implementation by introducing the projection of LoRA weights from selected layers to the safety-aligned subspace, effectively reducing the safety risks in LLM fine-tuning while maintaining utility. It is worth noting that $\textsf{Safe LoRA}$ is a training-free and data-free approach, as it only requires the knowledge of the weights from the base and aligned LLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that when fine-tuning on purely malicious data, $\textsf{Safe LoRA}$ retains similar safety performance as the original aligned model. Moreover, when the fine-tuning dataset contains a mixture of both benign and malicious data,  $\textsf{Safe LoRA}$ mitigates the negative effect made by malicious data while preserving performance on downstream tasks.  Our codes are available at https://github.com/IBM/SafeLoRA."
Poster,SAFE: Slow and Fast Parameter-Efficient Tuning for Continual Learning with Pre-Trained Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96124,"Linglan Zhao, Xuerui Zhang, Ke Yan, Shouhong Ding, Weiran Huang","Continual learning aims to incrementally acquire new concepts in data streams while resisting forgetting previous knowledge.With the rise of powerful pre-trained models (PTMs), there is a growing interest in training incremental learning systems using these foundation models, rather than learning from scratch. Existing works often view PTMs as a strong initial point and directly apply parameter-efficient tuning (PET) in the first session for adapting to downstream tasks.In the following sessions, most methods freeze model parameters for tackling forgetting issues. However, applying PET directly to downstream data cannot fully explore the inherent knowledge in PTMs.Additionally, freezing the parameters in incremental sessions hinders models' plasticity to novel concepts not covered in the first session. To solve the above issues, we propose a Slow And Fast parameter-Efficient tuning (SAFE) framework.In particular, to inherit general knowledge from foundation models, we include a transfer loss function by measuring the correlation between the PTM and the PET-applied model.After calibrating in the first session, the slow efficient tuning parameters can capture more informative features, improving generalization to incoming classes.Moreover, to further incorporate novel concepts, we strike a balance between stability and plasticity by fixing slow efficient tuning parameters and continuously updating the fast ones.Specifically, a cross-classification loss with feature alignment is proposed to circumvent catastrophic forgetting.During inference, we introduce an entropy-based aggregation strategy to dynamically utilize the complementarity in the slow and fast learners.Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our method by significantly surpassing the state-of-the-art."
Poster,SafeSora: Towards Safety Alignment of Text2Video Generation via a Human Preference Dataset,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97641,"Juntao Dai, Tianle Chen, Xuyao Wang, Ziran Yang, Taiye Chen, Jiaming Ji, Yaodong Yang","To mitigate the risk of harmful outputs from large vision models (LVMs), we introduce the *SafeSora* dataset to promote research on aligning text-to-video generation with human values. This dataset encompasses human preferences in text-to-video generation tasks along two primary dimensions: helpfulness and harmlessness. To capture in-depth human preferences and facilitate structured reasoning by crowdworkers, we subdivide helpfulness into 4 sub-dimensions and harmlessness into 12 sub-categories, serving as the basis for pilot annotations. The *SafeSora* dataset includes 14,711 unique prompts, 57,333 unique videos generated by 4 distinct LVMs, and 51,691 pairs of preference annotations labeled by humans. We further demonstrate the utility of the *SafeSora* dataset through several applications, including training the text-video moderation model and aligning LVMs with human preference by fine-tuning a prompt augmentation module or the diffusion model. These applications highlight its potential as the foundation for text-to-video alignment research, such as human preference modeling and the development and validation of alignment algorithms.

Poster,Safe Time-Varying Optimization based on Gaussian Processes with Spatio-Temporal Kernel,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93028,"Jialin Li, Marta Zagorowska, Giulia De Pasquale, Alisa Rupenyan, John Lygeros","Ensuring safety is a key aspect in sequential decision making problems, such as robotics or process control. The complexity of the underlying systems often makes finding the optimal decision challenging, especially when the safety-critical system is time-varying. Overcoming the problem of optimizing an unknown time-varying reward subject to unknown time-varying safety constraints, we propose TVSAFEOPT, a new algorithm built on Bayesian optimization with a spatio-temporal kernel. The algorithm is capable of safely tracking a time-varying safe region without the need for explicit change detection. Optimality guarantees are also provided for the algorithm when the optimization problem becomes stationary. We show that TVSAFEOPT compares favorably against SAFEOPT on synthetic data, both regarding safety and optimality. Evaluation on a realistic case study with gas compressors confirms that TVSAFEOPT ensures safety when solving time-varying optimization problems with unknown reward and safety functions."
