Poster,DiGRAF: Diffeomorphic Graph-Adaptive Activation Function,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94628,"Krishna Sri Ipsit Mantri, Xinzhi Wang, Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb, Bruno Ribeiro, Beatrice Bevilacqua, Moshe Eliasof","In this paper, we propose a novel activation function tailored specifically for graph data in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Motivated by the need for graph-adaptive and flexible activation functions, we introduce DiGRAF, leveraging Continuous Piecewise-Affine Based (CPAB) transformations, which we augment with an additional GNN to learn a graph-adaptive diffeomorphic activation function in an end-to-end manner. In addition to its graph-adaptivity and flexibility, DiGRAF also possesses properties that are widely recognized as desirable for activation functions, such as differentiability, boundness within the domain, and computational efficiency. We conduct an extensive set of experiments across diverse datasets and tasks, demonstrating a consistent and superior performance of DiGRAF compared to traditional and graph-specific activation functions, highlighting its effectiveness as an activation function for GNNs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ipsitmantri/DiGRAF."
Poster,DI-MaskDINO: A Joint Object Detection and Instance Segmentation Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93369,"Zhixiong Nan, Li Xianghong, Tao Xiang, Jifeng Dai","This paper is motivated by an interesting phenomenon: the performance of object detection lags behind that of instance segmentation (i.e., performance imbalance) when investigating the intermediate results from the beginning transformer decoder layer of MaskDINO (i.e., the SOTA model for joint detection and segmentation). This phenomenon inspires us to think about a question: will the performance imbalance at the beginning layer of transformer decoder constrain the upper bound of the final performance? With this question in mind, we further conduct qualitative and quantitative pre-experiments, which validate the negative impact of detection-segmentation imbalance issue on the model performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes DI-MaskDINO model, the core idea of which is to improve the final performance by alleviating the detection-segmentation imbalance. DI-MaskDINO is implemented by configuring our proposed De-Imbalance (DI) module and Balance-Aware Tokens Optimization (BATO) module to MaskDINO. DI is responsible for generating balance-aware query, and BATO uses the balance-aware query to guide the optimization of the initial feature tokens. The balance-aware query and optimized feature tokens are respectively taken as the Query and Key&Value of transformer decoder to perform joint object detection and instance segmentation. DI-MaskDINO outperforms existing joint object detection and instance segmentation models on COCO and BDD100K benchmarks, achieving +1.2 $AP^{box}$ and +0.9 $AP^{mask}$ improvements compared to SOTA joint detection and segmentation model MaskDINO. In addition, DI-MaskDINO also obtains +1.0 $AP^{box}$ improvement compared to SOTA object detection model DINO and +3.0 $AP^{mask}$ improvement compared to SOTA segmentation model Mask2Former."
Poster,Dimension-free deterministic equivalents and scaling laws for random feature regression,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95995,"Leonardo Defilippis, Bruno Loureiro, Theodor Misiakiewicz","In this work we investigate the generalization performance of random feature ridge regression (RFRR). Our main contribution is a general deterministic equivalent for the test error of RFRR. Specifically, under a certain concentration property, we show that the test error is well approximated by a closed-form expression that only depends on the feature map eigenvalues. Notably, our approximation guarantee is non-asymptotic, multiplicative, and independent of the feature map dimension---allowing for infinite-dimensional features. We expect this deterministic equivalent to hold broadly beyond our theoretical analysis, and we empirically validate its predictions on various real and synthetic datasets. As an application, we derive sharp excess error rates under standard power-law assumptions of the spectrum and target decay. In particular, we provide a tight result for the smallest number of features achieving optimal minimax error rate."
Poster,Dimension-free Private Mean Estimation for Anisotropic Distributions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93891,"Yuval Dagan, Michael Jordan, Xuelin Yang, Lydia Zakynthinou, Nikita Zhivotovskiy","We present differentially private algorithms for high-dimensional mean estimation. Previous private estimators on distributions over $\mathbb{R}^d$ suffer from a curse of dimensionality, as they require $\Omega(d^{1/2})$ samples to achieve non-trivial error, even in cases where $O(1)$ samples suffice without privacy. This rate is  unavoidable when the distribution is isotropic, namely, when the covariance is a multiple of the identity matrix. Yet, real-world data is often highly anisotropic, with signals concentrated on a small number of principal components. We develop estimators that are appropriate for such signals---our estimators are $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differentially private and have sample complexity that is dimension-independent for anisotropic subgaussian distributions.  Given $n$ samples from a distribution with known covariance-proxy $\Sigma$ and unknown mean $\mu$, we present an estimator $\hat{\mu}$ that achieves error, $\|\hat{\mu}-\mu\|_2\leq \alpha$, as long as $n\gtrsim \text{tr}(\Sigma)/\alpha^2+ \text{tr}(\Sigma^{1/2})/(\alpha\varepsilon)$. We show that this is the optimal sample complexity for this task up to logarithmic factors. Moreover, for the case of unknown covariance, we present an algorithm whose sample complexity has improved dependence on the dimension, from $d^{1/2}$ to $d^{1/4}$."
Poster,DiMSUM: Diffusion Mamba - A Scalable and Unified Spatial-Frequency Method for Image Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95642,"Hao Phung, Quan Dao, Trung Dao, Viet Hoang Phan, Dimitris Metaxas, Anh Tran","We introduce a novel state-space architecture for diffusion models, effectively harnessing spatial and frequency information to enhance the inductive bias towards local features in input images for image generation tasks. While state-space networks, including Mamba, a revolutionary advancement in recurrent neural networks, typically scan input sequences from left to right, they face difficulties in designing effective scanning strategies, especially in the processing of image data. Our method demonstrates that integrating wavelet transformation into Mamba enhances the local structure awareness of visual inputs and better captures long-range relations of frequencies by disentangling them into wavelet subbands, representing both low- and high-frequency components. These wavelet-based outputs are then processed and seamlessly fused with the original Mamba outputs through a cross-attention fusion layer, combining both spatial and frequency information to optimize the order awareness of state-space models which is essential for the details and overall quality of image generation. Besides, we introduce a globally-shared transformer to supercharge the performance of Mamba, harnessing its exceptional power to capture global relationships. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, our method demonstrates superior results compared to DiT and DIFFUSSM, achieving faster training convergence and delivering high-quality outputs. The codes and pretrained models are released at https://github.com/VinAIResearch/DiMSUM.git."
Poster,DINTR: Tracking via Diffusion-based Interpolation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94161,"Pha Nguyen, Ngan Le, Jackson Cothren, Alper Yilmaz, Khoa Luu","Object tracking is a fundamental task in computer vision, requiring the localization of objects of interest across video frames. Diffusion models have shown remarkable capabilities in visual generation, making them well-suited for addressing several requirements of the tracking problem. This work proposes a novel diffusion-based methodology to formulate the tracking task. Firstly, their conditional process allows for injecting indications of the target object into the generation process. Secondly, diffusion mechanics can be developed to inherently model temporal correspondences, enabling the reconstruction of actual frames in video. However, existing diffusion models rely on extensive and unnecessary mapping to a Gaussian noise domain, which can be replaced by a more efficient and stable interpolation process. Our proposed interpolation mechanism draws inspiration from classic image-processing techniques, offering a more interpretable, stable, and faster approach tailored specifically for the object tracking task. By leveraging the strengths of diffusion models while circumventing their limitations, our Diffusion-based INterpolation TrackeR (DINTR) presents a promising new paradigm and achieves a superior multiplicity on seven benchmarks across five indicator representations."
Poster,DiPEx: Dispersing Prompt Expansion for Class-Agnostic Object Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95458,"Jia S Lim, Zhuoxiao Chen, Zhi Chen, Mahsa Baktashmotlagh, Xin Yu, Zi Huang, Yadan Luo","Class-agnostic object detection (OD) can be a cornerstone or a bottleneck for many downstream vision tasks. Despite considerable advancements in bottom-up and multi-object discovery methods that leverage basic visual cues to identify salient objects, consistently achieving a high recall rate remains difficult due to the diversity of object types and their contextual complexity. In this work, we investigate using vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance object detection via a self-supervised prompt learning strategy. Our initial findings indicate that manually crafted text queries often result in undetected objects, primarily because detection confidence diminishes when the query words exhibit semantic overlap. To address this, we propose a Dispersing Prompt Expansion (DiPEx) approach. DiPEx progressively learns to expand a set of distinct, non-overlapping hyperspherical prompts to enhance recall rates, thereby improving performance in downstream tasks such as out-of-distribution OD. Specifically, DiPEx initiates the process by self-training generic parent prompts and selecting the one with the highest semantic uncertainty for further expansion. The resulting child prompts are expected to inherit semantics from their parent prompts while capturing more fine-grained semantics. We apply dispersion losses to ensure high inter-class discrepancy among child prompts while preserving semantic consistency between parent-child prompt pairs. To prevent excessive growth of the prompt sets, we utilize the maximum angular coverage (MAC) of the semantic space as a criterion for early termination. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiPEx through extensive class-agnostic OD and OOD-OD experiments on MS-COCO and LVIS, surpassing other prompting methods by up to 20.1% in AR and achieving a 21.3% AP improvement over SAM."
Poster,DiP-GO: A Diffusion Pruner via Few-step Gradient Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93385,"Haowei Zhu, Dehua Tang, Ji Liu, Mingjie Lu, Jintu Zheng, Jinzhang Peng, Dong Li, Yu Wang, Fan Jiang, Lu Tian, Spandan Tiwari, Ashish Sirasao, Jun-Hai Yong, Bin Wang, Emad Barsoum","Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in the field of image generation due to their outstanding capabilities. However, these models require substantial computing resources because of the multi-step denoising process during inference. While traditional pruning methods have been employed to optimize these models, the retraining process necessitates large-scale training datasets and extensive computational costs to maintain generalization ability, making it neither convenient nor efficient. Recent studies attempt to utilize the similarity of features across adjacent denoising stages to reduce computational costs through simple and static strategies. However, these strategies cannot fully harness the potential of the similar feature patterns across adjacent timesteps. In this work, we propose a novel pruning method that derives an efficient diffusion model via a more intelligent and differentiable pruner. At the core of our approach is casting the model pruning process into a SubNet search process. Specifically, we first introduce a SuperNet based on standard diffusion via adding some backup connections built upon the similar features. We then construct a plugin pruner network and design optimization losses to identify redundant computation. Finally, our method can identify an optimal SubNet through few-step gradient optimization and a simple post-processing procedure. We conduct extensive experiments on various diffusion models including Stable Diffusion series and DiTs. Our DiP-GO approach achieves 4.4 x speedup for SD-1.5 without any loss of accuracy, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art methods."
Poster,Direct3D: Scalable Image-to-3D Generation via 3D Latent Diffusion Transformer,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93214,"Wu Shuang, Youtian Lin, Yifei Zeng, Feihu Zhang, Jingxi Xu, Philip Torr, Xun Cao, Yao Yao","Generating high-quality 3D assets from text and images has long been challenging, primarily due to the absence of scalable 3D representations capable of capturing intricate geometry distributions. In this work, we introduce Direct3D, a native 3D generative model scalable to in-the-wild input images, without requiring a multi-view diffusion model or SDS optimization. Our approach comprises two primary components: a Direct 3D Variational Auto-Encoder (D3D-VAE) and a Direct 3D Diffusion Transformer (D3D-DiT). D3D-VAE efficiently encodes high-resolution 3D shapes into a compact and continuous latent triplane space. Notably, our method directly supervises the decoded geometry using a semi-continuous surface sampling strategy, diverging from previous methods relying on rendered images as supervision signals. D3D-DiT models the distribution of encoded 3D latents and is specifically designed to fuse positional information from the three feature maps of the triplane latent, enabling a native 3D generative model scalable to large-scale 3D datasets. Additionally, we introduce an innovative image-to-3D generation pipeline incorporating semantic and pixel-level image conditions, allowing the model to produce 3D shapes consistent with the provided conditional image input. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our large-scale pre-trained Direct3D over previous image-to-3D approaches, achieving significantly better generation quality and generalization ability, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art for 3D content creation.

Poster,Direct Consistency Optimization for Robust Customization of Text-to-Image Diffusion models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94883,"Kyungmin Lee, Sangkyung Kwak, Kihyuk Sohn, Jinwoo Shin","Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, when fine-tuned on a few personal images, can generate visuals with a high degree of consistency. However, such fine-tuned models are not robust; they often fail to compose with concepts of pretrained model or other fine-tuned models. To address this, we propose a novel fine-tuning objective, dubbed Direct Consistency Optimization, which controls the deviation between fine-tuning and pretrained models to retain the pretrained knowledge during fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments on subject and style customization, we demonstrate that our method positions itself on a superior Pareto frontier between subject (or style) consistency and image-text alignment over all previous baselines; it not only outperforms regular fine-tuning objective in image-text alignment, but also shows higher fidelity to the reference images than the method that fine-tunes with additional prior dataset. More importantly, the models fine-tuned with our method can be merged without interference, allowing us to generate custom subjects in a custom style by composing separately customized subject and style models. Notably, we show that our approach achieves better prompt fidelity and subject fidelity than those post-optimized for merging regular fine-tuned models."
