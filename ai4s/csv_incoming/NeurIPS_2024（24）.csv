Poster,A Local Method for Satisfying Interventional Fairness with Partially Known Causal Graphs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95419,"Haoxuan Li, Yue Liu, Zhi Geng, Kun Zhang","Developing fair automated machine learning algorithms is critical in making safe and trustworthy decisions. Many causality-based fairness notions have been proposed to address the above issues by quantifying the causal connections between sensitive attributes and decisions, and when the true causal graph is fully known, certain algorithms that achieve interventional fairness have been proposed. However, when the true causal graph is unknown, it is still challenging to effectively and efficiently exploit partially directed acyclic graphs (PDAGs) to achieve interventional fairness. To exploit the PDAGs for achieving interventional fairness, previous methods have been built on variable selection or causal effect identification, but limited to reduced prediction accuracy or strong assumptions. In this paper, we propose a general min-max optimization framework that can achieve interventional fairness with promising prediction accuracy and can be extended to maximally oriented PDAGs (MPDAGs) with added background knowledge. Specifically, we first estimate all possible treatment effects of sensitive attributes on a given prediction model from all possible adjustment sets of sensitive attributes via an efficient local approach. Next, we propose to alternatively update the prediction model and possible estimated causal effects, where the prediction model is trained via a min-max loss to control the worst-case fairness violations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets verify the superiority of our methods. To benefit the research community, we have released our project at https://github.com/haoxuanli-pku/NeurIPS24-Interventional-Fairness-with-PDAGs."
Poster,AlphaMath Almost Zero: Process Supervision without Process,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94884,"Guoxin Chen, Minpeng Liao, Chengxi Li, Kai Fan","Although recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their performance on various tasks, they still face challenges with complex and symbolic multi-step reasoning, particularly in mathematical reasoning. To bolster the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, most existing efforts concentrate on seeking assistance from either domain experts or GPT-4 for high-quality process-supervised data, which is not only expensive but also labor-intensive. In our study, we propose an innovative framework, AlphaMath, that bypasses the need for process annotations (from humans or GPTs) by leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This framework focuses on unleashing the potential of a well-pretrained LLM to autonomously enhance its mathematical reasoning. Specifically, we integrate a value model with the LLM, automatically generating both process supervision and step-level evaluation signals in MCTS. Furthermore, we propose an efficient inference strategy—step-level beam search, where the value model is crafted to assist the policy model (i.e., LLM) in navigating more effective reasoning paths, rather than solely relying on prior probabilities. The experimental results on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets demonstrate that even without GPT-4 or human-annotated process supervision, our AlphaMath framework achieves comparable or superior results to previous state-of-the-art methods."
Poster,AlphaPruning: Using Heavy-Tailed Self Regularization Theory for Improved Layer-wise Pruning of Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94217,"Haiquan Lu, Yefan Zhou, Shiwei Liu, Zhangyang &quot;Atlas&quot; Wang, Michael Mahoney, Yaoqing Yang","Recent work on pruning large language models (LLMs) has shown that one can eliminate a large number of parameters without compromising performance, making pruning a promising strategy to reduce LLM model size. Existing LLM pruning strategies typically assign uniform pruning ratios across layers, limiting overall pruning ability; and recent work on layerwise pruning of LLMs is often based on heuristics that can easily lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we leverage Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) Theory, in particular the shape of empirical spectral densities (ESDs) of weight matrices, to design improved layerwise pruning ratios for LLMs. Our analysis reveals a wide variability in how well-trained, and thus relatedly how prunable, different layers of an LLM are. Based on this, we propose AlphaPruning, which uses shape metrics to allocate layerwise sparsity ratios in a more theoretically-principled manner. AlphaPruning can be used in conjunction with multiple existing LLM pruning methods. Our empirical results show that AlphaPruning prunes LLaMA-7B to 80% sparsity while maintaining reasonable perplexity, marking a first in the literature on LLMs."
Poster,AlphaTablets: A Generic Plane Representation for 3D Planar Reconstruction from Monocular Videos,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96421,"Yuze He, Wang Zhao, Shaohui Liu, Yubin Hu, Yushi Bai, Yu-Hui Wen, Yong-jin Liu","We introduce AlphaTablets, a novel and generic representation of 3D planes that features continuous 3D surface and precise boundary delineation. By representing 3D planes as rectangles with alpha channels, AlphaTablets combine the advantages of current 2D and 3D plane representations, enabling accurate, consistent and flexible modeling of 3D planes. We derive differentiable rasterization on top of AlphaTablets to efficiently render 3D planes into images, and propose a novel bottom-up pipeline for 3D planar reconstruction from monocular videos. Starting with 2D superpixels and geometric cues from pre-trained models, we initialize 3D planes as AlphaTablets and optimize them via differentiable rendering. An effective merging scheme is introduced to facilitate the growth and refinement of AlphaTablets. Through iterative optimization and merging, we reconstruct complete and accurate 3D planes with solid surfaces and clear boundaries. Extensive experiments on the ScanNet dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in 3D planar reconstruction, underscoring the great potential of AlphaTablets as a generic 3D plane representation for various applications."
Poster,ALPINE: Unveiling The Planning Capability of Autoregressive Learning in Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94843,"Siwei Wang, Yifei Shen, Shi Feng, Haoran Sun, Shang-Hua Teng, Wei Chen","Planning is a crucial element of both human intelligence and contemporary large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we initiate a theoretical investigation into the emergence of planning capabilities in Transformer-based LLMs via their next-word prediction mechanisms. We model planning as a network path-finding task, where the objective is to generate a valid path from a specified source node to a designated target node. Our mathematical characterization  shows that Transformer architectures can execute path-finding by embedding the adjacency and reachability matrices within their weights. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis of gradient-based learning dynamics reveals that LLMs can learn both the adjacency  and a limited form of the reachability matrices. These theoretical insights are then validated through experiments, which demonstrate that Transformer architectures indeed learn the adjacency and an incomplete reachability matrices, consistent with our theoretical predictions. When applying our methodology to the real-world planning benchmark Blocksworld, our observations remain consistent. Additionally, our analyses uncover a fundamental limitation of current Transformer architectures in path-finding: these architectures cannot identify reachability relationships through transitivity, which leads to failures in generating paths when concatenation is required. These findings provide new insights into how the internal mechanisms of autoregressive learning facilitate intelligent planning and deepen our understanding of how future LLMs might achieve more advanced and general planning-and-reasoning capabilities across diverse applications."
Poster,ALPS: Improved Optimization for Highly Sparse One-Shot Pruning for Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96911,"Xiang Meng, Kayhan Behdin, Haoyue Wang, Rahul Mazumder","The impressive performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various natural language processing tasks comes at the cost of vast computational resources and storage requirements. One-shot pruning techniques offer a way to alleviate these burdens by removing redundant weights without the need for retraining. Yet, the massive scale of LLMs often forces current pruning approaches to rely on heuristics instead of optimization-based techniques, potentially resulting in suboptimal compression. In this paper, we introduce ALPS, an optimization-based framework that tackles the pruning problem using the operator splitting technique and a preconditioned conjugate gradient-based post-processing step. Our approach incorporates novel techniques to accelerate and theoretically guarantee convergence while leveraging vectorization and GPU parallelism for efficiency. ALPS substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of the pruning objective and perplexity reduction, particularly for highly sparse models. On the LLaMA3-8B model with 70\% sparsity, ALPS achieves a 29\% reduction in test perplexity on the WikiText dataset and a 8\% improvement in zero-shot benchmark performance compared to existing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/mazumder-lab/ALPS."
Poster,AlterMOMA: Fusion Redundancy Pruning for Camera-LiDAR Fusion Models with Alternative Modality Masking,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93249,"Shiqi Sun, Yantao Lu, Ning Liu, Bo Jiang, Jinchao Chen, Ying Zhang","Camera-LiDAR fusion models significantly enhance perception performance in autonomous driving. The fusion mechanism leverages the strengths of each modality while minimizing their weaknesses. Moreover, in practice, camera-LiDAR fusion models utilize pre-trained backbones for efficient training. However, we argue that directly loading single-modal pre-trained camera and LiDAR backbones into camera-LiDAR fusion models introduces similar feature redundancy across modalities due to the nature of the fusion mechanism. Unfortunately, existing pruning methods are developed explicitly for single-modal models, and thus, they struggle to effectively identify these specific redundant parameters in camera-LiDAR fusion models. In this paper, to address the issue above on camera-LiDAR fusion models, we propose a novelty pruning framework Alternative Modality Masking Pruning (AlterMOMA), which employs alternative masking on each modality and identifies the redundant parameters. Specifically, when one modality parameters are masked (deactivated), the absence of features from the masked backbone compels the model to reactivate previous redundant features of the other modality backbone. Therefore, these redundant features and relevant redundant parameters can be identified via the reactivation process. The redundant parameters can be pruned by our proposed importance score evaluation function, Alternative Evaluation (AlterEva), which is based on the observation of the loss changes when certain modality parameters are activated and deactivated. Extensive experiments on the nuScene and KITTI datasets encompassing diverse tasks, baseline models, and pruning algorithms showcase that AlterMOMA outperforms existing pruning methods, attaining state-of-the-art performance."
Poster,AMAGO-2: Breaking the Multi-Task Barrier in Meta-Reinforcement Learning with Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95369,"Jake Grigsby, Justin Sasek, Samyak Parajuli, Ikechukwu D. Adebi, Amy Zhang, Yuke Zhu","Language models trained on diverse datasets unlock generalization by in-context learning. Reinforcement Learning (RL) policies can achieve a similar effect by meta-learning within the memory of a sequence model. However, meta-RL research primarily focuses on adapting to minor variations of a single task. It is difficult to scale towards more general behavior without confronting challenges in multi-task optimization, and few solutions are compatible with meta-RL's goal of learning from large training sets of unlabeled tasks. To address this challenge, we revisit the idea that multi-task RL is bottlenecked by imbalanced training losses created by uneven return scales across different tasks. We build upon recent advancements in Transformer-based (in-context) meta-RL and evaluate a simple yet scalable solution where both an agent's actor and critic objectives are converted to classification terms that decouple optimization from the current scale of returns. Large-scale comparisons in Meta-World ML45, Multi-Game Procgen, Multi-Task POPGym, Multi-Game Atari, and BabyAI find that this design unlocks significant progress in online multi-task adaptation and memory problems without explicit task labels."
Poster,AMBROSIA: A Benchmark for Parsing Ambiguous Questions into Database Queries,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97762,"Irina Saparina, Mirella Lapata","Practical semantic parsers are expected to understand user utterances and map them to executable programs, even when these are ambiguous. We introduce a new benchmark, AMBROSIA, which we hope will inform and inspire the development of text-to-SQL parsers capable of recognizing and interpreting ambiguous requests. Our dataset contains questions showcasing three different types of ambiguity (scope ambiguity, attachment ambiguity, and vagueness), their interpretations, and corresponding SQL queries. In each case, the ambiguity persists even when the database context is provided. This is achieved through a novel approach that involves controlled generation of databases from scratch. We benchmark various LLMs on AMBROSIA, revealing that even the most advanced models struggle to identify and interpret ambiguity in questions."
Poster,A Metalearned Neural Circuit for Nonparametric Bayesian Inference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96121,"Jake Snell, Gianluca Bencomo, Tom Griffiths","Most applications of machine learning to classification assume a closed set of balanced classes. This is at odds with the real world, where class occurrence statistics often follow a long-tailed power-law distribution and it is unlikely that all classes are seen in a single sample. Nonparametric Bayesian models naturally capture this phenomenon, but have significant practical barriers to widespread adoption, namely implementation complexity and computational inefficiency. To address this, we present a method for extracting the inductive bias from a nonparametric Bayesian model and transferring it to an artificial neural network. By simulating data with a nonparametric Bayesian prior, we can metalearn a sequence model that performs inference over an unlimited set of classes. After training, this ""neural circuit"" has distilled the corresponding inductive bias and can successfully perform sequential inference over an open set of classes. Our experimental results show that the metalearned neural circuit achieves comparable or better performance than particle filter-based methods for inference in these models while being faster and simpler to use than methods that explicitly incorporate Bayesian nonparametric inference."
