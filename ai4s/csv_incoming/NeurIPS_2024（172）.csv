Poster,GLBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Graph with Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97881,"Yuhan Li, Peisong Wang, Xiao Zhu, Aochuan Chen, Haiyun Jiang, Deng Cai, Wai Kin (Victor) Chan, Jia Li","The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the way we interact with graphs, leading to a new paradigm called GraphLLM. Despite the rapid development of GraphLLM methods in recent years, the progress and understanding of this field remain unclear due to the lack of a benchmark with consistent experimental protocols. To bridge this gap, we introduce GLBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GraphLLM methods in both supervised and zero-shot scenarios. GLBench provides a fair and thorough evaluation of different categories of GraphLLM methods, along with traditional baselines such as graph neural networks. Through extensive experiments on a collection of real-world datasets with consistent data processing and splitting strategies, we have uncovered several key findings. Firstly, GraphLLM methods outperform traditional baselines in supervised settings, with LLM-as-enhancers showing the most robust performance. However, using LLMs as predictors is less effective and often leads to uncontrollable output issues. We also notice that no clear scaling laws exist for current GraphLLM methods. In addition, both structures and semantics are crucial for effective zero-shot transfer, and our proposed simple baseline can even outperform several models tailored for zero-shot scenarios. The data and code of the benchmark can be found at https://github.com/NineAbyss/GLBench."
Poster,Gliding over the Pareto Front with Uniform Designs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94814,"Xiaoyuan Zhang, Genghui Li, Xi Lin, Yichi Zhang, Yifan Chen, Qingfu Zhang","Multiobjective optimization (MOO) plays a critical role in various real-world domains. A major challenge therein is generating $K$ uniform Pareto-optimal solutions to represent the entire Pareto front. To address this issue, this paper firstly introduces \emph{fill distance} to evaluate the $K$ design points, which provides a quantitative metric for the representativeness of the design. However, directly specifying the optimal design that minimizes the fill distance is nearly intractable due to the nested $\min-\max-\min$ optimization problem. To address this, we propose a surrogate ``max-packing'' design for the fill distance design, which is easier to optimize and leads to a rate-optimal design with a fill distance at most $4\times$ the minimum value.    Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed paradigm efficiently produces high-quality, representative solutions and outperforms baseline methods."
Poster,GLinSAT: The General Linear Satisfiability Neural Network Layer By Accelerated Gradient Descent,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93783,"Hongtai Zeng, Chao Yang, Yanzhen Zhou, Cheng Yang, Qinglai Guo","Ensuring that the outputs of neural networks satisfy specific constraints is crucial for applying neural networks to real-life decision-making problems. In this paper, we consider making a batch of neural network outputs satisfy bounded and general linear constraints. We first reformulate the neural network output projection problem as an entropy-regularized linear programming problem. We show that such a problem can be equivalently transformed into an unconstrained convex optimization problem with Lipschitz continuous gradient according to the duality theorem. Then, based on an accelerated gradient descent algorithm with numerical performance enhancement, we present our architecture, GLinSAT, to solve the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first general linear satisfiability layer in which all the operations are differentiable and matrix-factorization-free. Despite the fact that we can explicitly perform backpropagation based on automatic differentiation mechanism, we also provide an alternative approach in GLinSAT to calculate the derivatives based on implicit differentiation of the optimality condition. Experimental results on constrained traveling salesman problems, partial graph matching with outliers, predictive portfolio allocation and power system unit commitment demonstrate the advantages of GLinSAT over existing satisfiability layers. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/HunterTracer/GLinSAT."
Poster,GL-NeRF: Gauss-Laguerre Quadrature Enables Training-Free NeRF Acceleration,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95918,"Silong Yong, Yaqi Xie, Simon Stepputtis, Katia Sycara","Volume rendering in neural radiance fields is inherently time-consuming due to the large number of MLP calls on the points sampled per ray. Previous works would address this issue by introducing new neural networks or data structures. In this work, we propose GL-NeRF, a new perspective of computing volume rendering with the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature. GL-NeRF significantly reduces the number of MLP calls needed for volume rendering, introducing no additional data structures or neural networks. The simple formulation makes adopting GL-NeRF in any NeRF model possible. In the paper, we first justify the use of the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature and then demonstrate this plug-and-play attribute by implementing it in two different NeRF models. We show that with a minimal drop in performance, GL-NeRF can significantly reduce the number of MLP calls, showing the potential to speed up any NeRF model. Code can be found in project page https://silongyong.github.io/GL-NeRF_project_page/."
Poster,Global Convergence in Training Large-Scale Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96288,"Cheng Gao, Yuan Cao, Zihao Li, Yihan He, Mengdi Wang, Han Liu, Jason Klusowski, Jianqing Fan","Despite the widespread success of Transformers across various domains, their optimization guarantees in large-scale model settings are not well-understood. This paper rigorously analyzes the convergence properties of gradient flow in training Transformers with weight decay regularization. First, we construct the mean-field limit of large-scale Transformers, showing that as the model width and depth go to infinity, gradient flow converges to the Wasserstein gradient flow, which is represented by a partial differential equation. Then, we demonstrate that the gradient flow reaches a global minimum consistent with the PDE solution when the weight decay regularization parameter is sufficiently small. Our analysis is based on a series of novel mean-field techniques that adapt to Transformers. Compared with existing tools for deep networks (Lu et al., 2020) that demand homogeneity and global Lipschitz smoothness, we utilize a refined analysis assuming only $\textit{partial homogeneity}$ and $\textit{local Lipschitz smoothness}$. These new techniques may be of independent interest."
Poster,Global Distortions from Local Rewards: Neural Coding Strategies in Path-Integrating Neural Systems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96333,"Francisco Acosta, Fatih Dinc, William Redman, Manu Madhav, David Klindt, Nina Miolane","Grid cells in the mammalian brain are fundamental to spatial navigation, and therefore crucial to how animals perceive and interact with their environment. Traditionally, grid cells are thought support path integration through highly symmetric hexagonal lattice firing patterns. However, recent findings show that their firing patterns become distorted in the presence of significant spatial landmarks such as rewarded locations. This introduces a novel perspective of dynamic, subjective, and action-relevant interactions between spatial representations and environmental cues. Here, we propose a practical and theoretical framework to quantify and explain these interactions. To this end, we train path-integrating recurrent neural networks (piRNNs) on a spatial navigation task, whose goal is to predict the agent's position with a special focus on rewarded locations. Grid-like neurons naturally emerge from the training of piRNNs, which allows us to investigate how the two aspects of the task, space and reward, are integrated in their firing patterns. We find that geometry, but not topology, of the grid cell population code becomes distorted. Surprisingly, these distortions are global in the firing patterns of the grid cells despite local changes in the reward. Our results indicate that after training with location-specific reward information, the preserved representational topology supports successful path integration, whereas the emergent heterogeneity in individual responses due to global distortions may encode dynamically changing environmental cues. By bridging the gap between computational models and the biological reality of spatial navigation under reward information, we offer new insights into how neural systems prioritize environmental landmarks in their spatial navigation code."
Poster,"Global Lyapunov functions: a long-standing open problem in mathematics, with symbolic transformers",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93899,"Alberto Alfarano, Francois Charton, Amaury Hayat","Despite their spectacular progress, language models still struggle on complex reasoning tasks, such as advanced mathematics.We consider a long-standing open problem in mathematics: discovering a Lyapunov function that ensures the global stability of a dynamical system. This problem has no known general solution, and algorithmic solvers only exist for some small polynomial systems.We propose a new method for generating synthetic training samples from random solutions, and show that sequence-to-sequence transformers trained on such datasets perform better than algorithmic solvers and humans on polynomial systems, and can discover new Lyapunov functions for non-polynomial systems."
Poster,Globally Convergent Variational Inference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96338,"Declan McNamara, Jackson Loper, Jeffrey Regier","In variational inference (VI), an approximation of the posterior distribution is selected from a family of distributions through numerical optimization. With the most common variational objective function, known as the evidence lower bound (ELBO), only convergence to a *local* optimum can be guaranteed. In this work, we instead establish the *global* convergence of a particular VI method. This VI method, which may be considered an instance of neural posterior estimation (NPE), minimizes an expectation of the inclusive (forward) KL divergence to fit a variational distribution that is parameterized by a neural network. Our convergence result relies on the neural tangent kernel (NTK) to characterize the gradient dynamics that arise from considering the variational objective in function space. In the asymptotic regime of a fixed, positive-definite neural tangent kernel, we establish conditions under which the variational objective admits a unique solution in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Then, we show that the gradient descent dynamics in function space converge to this unique function. In ablation studies and practical problems, we demonstrate that our results explain the behavior of NPE in non-asymptotic finite-neuron settings, and show that NPE outperforms ELBO-based optimization, which often converges to shallow local optima."
Poster,Globally Q-linear Gauss-Newton Method for Overparameterized Non-convex Matrix Sensing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96818,"Xixi Jia, Fangchen FENG, Deyu Meng, Defeng Sun","This paper focuses on the optimization of overparameterized, non-convex low-rank matrix sensing (LRMS)—an essential component in contemporary statistics and machine learning. Recent years have witnessed significant breakthroughs in first-order methods, such as gradient descent, for tackling this non-convex optimization problem. However, the presence of numerous saddle points often prolongs the time required for gradient descent to overcome these obstacles. Moreover, overparameterization can markedly decelerate gradient descent methods, transitioning its convergence rate from linear to sub-linear.  In this paper, we introduce an approximated Gauss-Newton (AGN) method for tackling the non-convex LRMS problem. Notably, AGN incurs a computational cost comparable to gradient descent per iteration but converges much faster without being slowed down by saddle points. We prove that, despite the non-convexity of the objective function, AGN achieves Q-linear convergence from random initialization to the global optimal solution. The global Q-linear convergence of AGN represents a substantial enhancement over the convergence of the existing methods for the overparameterized non-convex LRMS. The code for this paper is available at \url{https://github.com/hsijiaxidian/AGN}."
Poster,Global Rewards in Restless Multi-Armed Bandits,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96734,"Naveen Raman, Zheyuan Shi, Fei Fang","Restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) extend multi-armed bandits so arm pulls impact future arm states. Despite the success of RMABs, a key limiting assumption is the separability of rewards into a sum across arms. We address this deficiency by proposing restless-multi-armed bandit with global rewards (RMAB-G), a generalization of RMABs to global non-separable rewards. To solve RMAB-G, we develop the Linear-Whittle and Shapley-Whittle indices, which extend Whittle indices from RMABs to RMAB-Gs. We prove approximation bounds which demonstrate how Linear and Shapley-Whittle indices fail for non-linear rewards. To overcome this limitation, we propose two sets of adaptive policies: the first computes indices iteratively and the second combines indices with Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Empirically, we demonstrate that adaptive policies outperform both pre-computed index policies and baselines in synthetic and real-world food rescue datasets."
