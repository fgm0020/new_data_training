Poster,EffiLearner: Enhancing Efficiency of Generated Code via Self-Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95648,"Dong HUANG, Jianbo Dai, Han Weng, Puzhen Wu, Yuhao QING, Heming Cui, Zhijiang Guo, Jie Zhang","Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in code generation, but their generated code often suffers from inefficiency, resulting in longer execution times and higher memory consumption. To address this issue, we propose EffiLearner, a self-optimization framework that utilizes execution overhead profiles to improve the efficiency of LLM-generated code. EffiLearner first generates code using an LLM, then executes it locally to capture execution time and memory usage profiles. These profiles are fed back to the LLM, which then revises the code to reduce overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness of EffiLearner, we conduct extensive experiments on EffiBench and two commonly used code generation benchmarks with 16 open-source and 6 closed-source models. Our evaluation results demonstrate that through iterative self-optimization, EffiLearner significantly enhances the efficiency of LLM-generated code. For example, the execution time (ET) of StarCoder2-15B for the EffiBench decreases from 0.93 (s) to 0.12 (s) which reduces 87.1\%  execution time requirement compared with the initial code. The total memory usage (TMU) of StarCoder2-15B also decreases from 22.02 (Mb*s) to 2.03 (Mb*s), which decreases 90.8\% total memory consumption during the execution process."
Poster,EgoChoir: Capturing 3D Human-Object Interaction Regions from Egocentric Views,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94259,"Yuhang Yang, Wei Zhai, Chengfeng Wang, Chengjun Yu, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha","Understanding egocentric human-object interaction (HOI) is a fundamental aspect of human-centric perception, facilitating applications like AR/VR and embodied AI. For the egocentric HOI, in addition to perceiving semantics e.g., ''what'' interaction is occurring, capturing ''where'' the interaction specifically manifests in 3D space is also crucial, which links the perception and operation. Existing methods primarily leverage observations of HOI to capture interaction regions from an exocentric view. However, incomplete observations of interacting parties in the egocentric view introduce ambiguity between visual observations and interaction contents, impairing their efficacy. From the egocentric view, humans integrate the visual cortex, cerebellum, and brain to internalize their intentions and interaction concepts of objects, allowing for the pre-formulation of interactions and making behaviors even when interaction regions are out of sight. In light of this, we propose harmonizing the visual appearance, head motion, and 3D object to excavate the object interaction concept and subject intention, jointly inferring 3D human contact and object affordance from egocentric videos. To achieve this, we present EgoChoir, which links object structures with interaction contexts inherent in appearance and head motion to reveal object affordance, further utilizing it to model human contact. Additionally, a gradient modulation is employed to adopt appropriate clues for capturing interaction regions across various egocentric scenarios. Moreover, 3D contact and affordance are annotated for egocentric videos collected from Ego-Exo4D and GIMO to support the task. Extensive experiments on them demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of EgoChoir."
Poster,EGODE: An Event-attended Graph ODE Framework for Modeling Rigid Dynamics,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93931,"Jingyang Yuan, Gongbo Sun, Zhiping Xiao, Hang Zhou, Xiao Luo, Junyu Luo, Yusheng Zhao, Wei Ju, Ming Zhang","This paper studies the problem of rigid dynamics modeling, which has a wide range of applications in robotics, graphics, and mechanical design. The problem is partly solved by graph neural network (GNN) simulators. However, these approaches cannot effectively handle the relationship between intrinsic continuity and instantaneous changes in rigid dynamics. Moreover, they usually neglect hierarchical structures across mesh nodes and objects in systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Event-attend Graph ODE (EGODE) for effective rigid dynamics modeling. In particular, we describe the rigid system using both mesh node representations and object representations. To model continuous dynamics across hierarchical structures, we use a coupled graph ODE framework for the evolution of both types of representations over a long period. In addition, to capture instantaneous changes during the collision, we introduce an event module, which can effectively estimate the occurrence of the collision and update the states of both mesh node and object representations during evolution. Extensive experiments on a range of benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed EGODE compared to various state-of-the-art baselines.

Poster,EGonc : Energy-based Open-Set Node Classification with substitute Unknowns,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96733,"Qin Zhang, Zelin Shi, Shirui Pan, Junyang Chen, Huisi Wu, Xiaojun Chen","Open-set Classification (OSC) is a critical requirement for safely deploying machine learning models in the open world, which aims to classify samples from known classes and reject samples from out-of-distribution (OOD). Existing methods exploit the feature space of trained network and attempt at estimating the uncertainty in the predictions.However, softmax-based neural networks are found to be overly confident in their predictions even on data they have never seen before andthe immense diversity of the OOD examples also makes such methods fragile.To this end, we follow the idea of estimating the underlying density of the training data to decide whether a given input is close to the in-distribution (IND) data and adopt Energy-based models (EBMs) as density estimators. A novel energy-based generative open-set node classification method, \textit{EGonc}, is proposed to achieve open-set graph learning. Specifically, we generate substitute unknowns to mimic the distribution of real open-set samples firstly, based on the information of graph structures. Then, an additional energy logit representing the virtual OOD class is learned from the residual of the feature against the principal space, and matched with the original logits by a constant scaling. This virtual logit serves as the indicator of OOD-ness. EGonc has nice theoretical properties that guarantee an overall distinguishable margin between the detection scores for IND and OOD samples. Comprehensive experimental evaluations of EGonc also demonstrate its superiority."
Poster,EgoSim: An Egocentric Multi-view Simulator and Real Dataset for Body-worn Cameras during Motion and Activity,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97590,"Dominik Hollidt, Paul Streli, Jiaxi Jiang, Yasaman Haghighi, Changlin Qian, Xintong Liu, Christian Holz","Research on egocentric tasks in computer vision has mostly focused on head-mounted cameras, such as fisheye cameras or embedded cameras inside immersive headsets.We argue that the increasing miniaturization of optical sensors will lead to the prolific integration of cameras into many more body-worn devices at various locations.This will bring fresh perspectives to established tasks in computer vision and benefit key areas such as human motion tracking, body pose estimation, or action recognition---particularly for the lower body, which is typically occluded.In this paper, we introduce EgoSim, a novel simulator of body-worn cameras that generates realistic egocentric renderings from multiple perspectives across a wearer's body.A key feature of EgoSim is its use of real motion capture data to render motion artifacts, which are especially noticeable with arm- or leg-worn cameras.In addition, we introduce MultiEgoView, a dataset of egocentric footage from six body-worn cameras and ground-truth full-body 3D poses during several activities:119 hours of data are derived from AMASS motion sequences in four high-fidelity virtual environments, which we augment with 5 hours of real-world motion data from 13 participants using six GoPro cameras and 3D body pose references from an Xsens motion capture suit.We demonstrate EgoSim's effectiveness by training an end-to-end video-only 3D pose estimation network.Analyzing its domain gap, we show that our dataset and simulator substantially aid training for inference on real-world data.EgoSim code & MultiEgoView dataset: https://siplab.org/projects/EgoSim"
Poster,EGSST: Event-based Graph Spatiotemporal Sensitive Transformer for Object Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94394,"Sheng Wu, Hang Sheng, Hui Feng, Bo Hu","Event cameras provide exceptionally high temporal resolution in dynamic vision systems due to their unique event-driven mechanism. However, the sparse and asynchronous nature of event data makes frame-based visual processing methods inappropriate. This study proposes a novel framework, Event-based Graph Spatiotemporal Sensitive Transformer (EGSST), for the exploitation of spatial and temporal properties of event data. Firstly, a well-designed graph structure is employed to model event data, which not only preserves the original temporal data but also captures spatial details. Furthermore, inspired by the phenomenon that human eyes pay more attention to objects that produce significant dynamic changes, we design a Spatiotemporal Sensitivity Module (SSM) and an adaptive Temporal Activation Controller (TAC). Through these two modules, our framework can mimic the response of the human eyes in dynamic environments by selectively activating the temporal attention mechanism based on the relative dynamics of event data, thereby effectively conserving computational resources. In addition, the integration of a lightweight, multi-scale Linear Vision Transformer (LViT) markedly enhances processing efficiency. Our research proposes a fully event-driven approach, effectively exploiting the temporal precision of event data and optimising the allocation of computational resources by intelligently distinguishing the dynamics within the event data. The framework provides a lightweight, fast, accurate, and fully event-based solution for object detection tasks in complex dynamic environments, demonstrating significant practicality and potential for application."
Poster,EHRCon: Dataset for Checking Consistency between Unstructured Notes and Structured Tables in Electronic Health Records,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97848,"Yeonsu Kwon, Jiho Kim, Gyubok Lee, Seongsu Bae, Daeun Kyung, Wonchul Cha, Tom Pollard, Alistair Johnson, Edward Choi","Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are integral for storing comprehensive patient medical records, combining structured data (e.g., medications) with detailed clinical notes (e.g., physician notes). These elements are essential for straightforward data retrieval and provide deep, contextual insights into patient care. However, they often suffer from discrepancies due to unintuitive EHR system designs and human errors, posing serious risks to patient safety. To address this, we developed EHRCon, a new dataset and task specifically designed to ensure data consistency between structured tables and unstructured notes in EHRs.EHRCon was crafted in collaboration with healthcare professionals using the MIMIC-III EHR dataset, and includes manual annotations of 3,943 entities across 105 clinical notes checked against database entries for consistency.EHRCon has two versions, one using the original MIMIC-III schema, and another using the OMOP CDM schema, in order to increase its applicability and generalizability. Furthermore, leveraging the capabilities of large language models, we introduce CheckEHR, a novel framework for verifying the consistency between clinical notes and database tables. CheckEHR utilizes an eight-stage process and shows promising results in both few-shot and zero-shot settings. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/dustn1259/EHRCon}."
Poster,EHRNoteQA: An LLM Benchmark for Real-World Clinical Practice Using Discharge Summaries,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97643,"Sunjun Kweon, Jiyoun Kim, Heeyoung Kwak, Dongchul Cha, Hangyul Yoon, Kwang Kim, Jeewon Yang, Seunghyun Won, Edward Choi","Discharge summaries in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are crucial for clinical decision-making, but their length and complexity make information extraction challenging, especially when dealing with accumulated summaries across multiple patient admissions. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in addressing this challenge by efficiently analyzing vast and complex data. Existing benchmarks, however, fall short in properly evaluating LLMs' capabilities in this context, as they typically focus on single-note information or limited topics, failing to reflect the real-world inquiries required by clinicians. To bridge this gap, we introduce EHRNoteQA, a novel benchmark built on the MIMIC-IV EHR, comprising 962 different QA pairs each linked to distinct patients' discharge summaries. Every QA pair is initially generated using GPT-4 and then manually reviewed and refined by three clinicians to ensure clinical relevance. EHRNoteQA includes questions that require information across multiple discharge summaries and covers eight diverse topics, mirroring the complexity and diversity of real clinical inquiries. We offer EHRNoteQA in two formats: open-ended and multi-choice question answering, and propose a reliable evaluation method for each. We evaluate 27 LLMs using EHRNoteQA and examine various factors affecting the model performance (e.g., the length and number of discharge summaries). Furthermore, to validate EHRNoteQA as a reliable proxy for expert evaluations in clinical practice, we measure the correlation between the LLM performance on EHRNoteQA, and the LLM performance manually evaluated by clinicians. Results show that LLM performance on EHRNoteQA have higher correlation with clinician-evaluated performance (Spearman: 0.78, Kendall: 0.62) compared to other benchmarks, demonstrating its practical relevance in evaluating LLMs in clinical settings. EHRNoteQA will be publicly available to support further research and improve LLM evaluation in clinical practice. EHRNoteQA is publicly available under PhysioNet credential access at https://doi.org/10.13026/acga-ht95, and the code is available at https://github.com/ji-youn-kim/EHRNoteQA."
Poster,EigenVI: score-based variational inference with orthogonal function expansions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93317,"Diana Cai, Chirag Modi, Charles Margossian, Robert Gower, David Blei, Lawrence Saul","We develop EigenVI, an eigenvalue-based approach for black-box variational inference (BBVI). EigenVI constructs its variational approximations from orthogonal function expansions. For distributions over $\mathbb{R}^D$, the lowest order term in these expansions provides a Gaussian variational approximation, while higher-order terms provide a systematic way to model non-Gaussianity. These approximations are flexible enough to model complex distributions (multimodal, asymmetric), but they are simple enough that one can calculate their low-order moments and draw samples from them. EigenVI can also model other types of random variables (e.g., nonnegative, bounded) by constructing variational approximations from different families of orthogonal functions. Within these families, EigenVI computes the variational approximation that best matches the score function of the target distribution by minimizing a stochastic estimate of the Fisher divergence. Notably, this optimization reduces to solving a minimum eigenvalue problem, so that EigenVI effectively sidesteps the iterative gradient-based optimizations that are required for many other BBVI algorithms. (Gradient-based methods can be sensitive to learning rates, termination criteria, and other tunable hyperparameters.) We use EigenVI to approximate a variety of target distributions, including a benchmark suite of Bayesian models from posteriordb. On these distributions, we find that EigenVI is more accurate than existing methods for Gaussian BBVI."
Poster,einspace: Searching for Neural Architectures from Fundamental Operations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93480,"Linus Ericsson, Miguel Espinosa Minano, Chenhongyi Yang, Antreas Antoniou, Amos Storkey, Shay Cohen, Steven McDonagh, Elliot Crowley","Neural architecture search (NAS) finds high performing networks for a given task. Yet the results of NAS are fairly prosaic; they did not e.g. create a shift from convolutional structures to transformers. This is not least because the search spaces in NAS often aren’t diverse enough to include such transformations *a priori*. Instead, for NAS to provide greater potential for fundamental design shifts, we need a novel expressive search space design which is built from more fundamental operations. To this end, we introduce `einspace`, a search space based on a parameterised probabilistic context-free grammar. Our space is versatile, supporting architectures of various sizes and complexities, while also containing diverse network operations which allow it to model convolutions, attention components and more. It contains many existing competitive architectures, and provides flexibility for discovering new ones. Using this search space, we perform experiments to find novel architectures as well as improvements on existing ones on the diverse Unseen NAS datasets. We show that competitive architectures can be obtained by searching from scratch, and we consistently find large improvements when initialising the search with strong baselines. We believe that this work is an important advancement towards a transformative NAS paradigm where search space expressivity and strategic search initialisation play key roles."
