Poster,"Logarithmic Smoothing for Pessimistic Off-Policy Evaluation, Selection and Learning",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92960,"Otmane Sakhi, Imad Aouali, Pierre Alquier, Nicolas Chopin","This work investigates the offline formulation of the contextual bandit problem, where the goal is to leverage past interactions collected under a behavior policy to evaluate, select, and learn new, potentially better-performing, policies. Motivated by critical applications, we move beyond point estimators. Instead, we adopt the principle of _pessimism_ where we construct upper bounds that assess a policy's worst-case performance, enabling us to confidently select and learn improved policies. Precisely, we introduce novel, fully empirical concentration bounds for a broad class of importance weighting risk estimators. These bounds are general enough to cover most existing estimators and pave the way for the development of new ones. In particular, our pursuit of the tightest bound within this class motivates a novel estimator (LS), that _logarithmically smoothes_ large importance weights. The bound for LS is provably tighter than its competitors, and naturally results in improved policy selection and learning strategies. Extensive policy evaluation, selection, and learning experiments highlight the versatility and favorable performance of LS."
Poster,Log-concave Sampling from a Convex Body with a Barrier: a Robust and Unified Dikin Walk,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94777,"Yuzhou Gu, Nikki Lijing Kuang, Yian Ma, Zhao Song, Lichen Zhang","We consider the problem of sampling from a $d$-dimensional log-concave distribution $\pi(\theta) \propto \exp(-f(\theta))$ for $L$-Lipschitz $f$, constrained to a convex body (described by $n$ hyperplanes) equipped with a barrier function, contained in a ball of radius $R$ with a $w$-warm start. We propose a \emph{robust} sampling framework that computes spectral approximations to the Hessian of the barrier functions in each iteration. We prove that for the polytope constraints, sampling with the Lee-Sidford barrier function mixes within $\widetilde O((d^2+dL^2R^2)\log(w/\delta))$ steps with a per step cost of $\widetilde O(nd^{\omega-1})$, where $\omega\approx 2.37$ is the fast matrix multiplication exponent. Compared to the prior work of Mangoubi and Vishnoi, our approach gives faster mixing time as we are able to design a generalized soft-threshold Dikin walk beyond log-barrier.We further extend our result to show how to sample from a $d$-dimensional spectrahedron, the constrained set of a semidefinite program, specified by the set $\{x\in \mathbb{R}^d: \sum_{i=1}^d x_i A_i \succeq C \}$ where $A_1,\ldots,A_d, C$ are $n\times n$ real symmetric matrices. We design a walk that mixes in $\widetilde O((nd+dL^2R^2)\log(w/\delta))$ steps with a per iteration cost of $\widetilde O(n^\omega+n^2d^{3\omega-5})$. We improve the mixing time bound of prior best Dikin walk due to Narayanan and Rakhlin that mixes in $\widetilde O((n^2d^3+n^2dL^2R^2)\log(w/\delta))$ steps."
Poster,Logical characterizations of recurrent graph neural networks with reals and floats,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94525,"Veeti Ahvonen, Damian Heiman, Antti Kuusisto, Carsten Lutz","In pioneering work from 2019, Barceló and coauthors identified logics that precisely match the expressive power of constant iteration-depth graph neural networks (GNNs) relative to properties definable in first-order logic. In this article, we give exact logical characterizations of recurrent GNNs in two scenarios: (1) in the setting with floating-point numbers and (2) with reals. For floats, the formalism matching recurrent GNNs is a rule-based modal logic with counting, while for reals we use a suitable infinitary modal logic, also with counting. These results give exact matches between logics and GNNs in the recurrent setting without relativising to a background logic in either case, but using some natural assumptions about floating-point arithmetic. Applying our characterizations, we also prove that, relative to graph properties definable in monadic second-order logic (MSO), our infinitary and rule-based logics are equally expressive. This implies that recurrent GNNs with reals and floats have the same expressive power over MSO-definable properties and shows that, for such properties, also recurrent GNNs with reals are characterized by a (finitary!) rule-based modal logic. In the general case, in contrast, the expressive power with floats is weaker than with reals. In addition to logic-oriented results, we also characterize recurrent GNNs, with both reals and floats, via distributed automata, drawing links to distributed computing models."
Poster,LogiCity: Advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI with Abstract Urban Simulation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97738,"Bowen Li, Zhaoyu Li, Qiwei Du, Jinqi Luo, Wenshan Wang, Yaqi Xie, Simon Stepputtis, Chen Wang, Katia Sycara, Pradeep Ravikumar, Alexander Gray, Xujie Si, Sebastian Scherer","Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI systems, which integrate symbolic reasoning into deep neural networks.However, most of the existing benchmarks for NeSy AI fail to provide long-horizon reasoning tasks with complex multi-agent interactions.Furthermore, they are usually constrained by fixed and simplistic logical rules over limited entities, making them far from real-world complexities.To address these crucial gaps, we introduce LogiCity, the first simulator based on customizable first-order logic (FOL) for an urban-like environment with multiple dynamic agents.LogiCity models diverse urban elements using semantic and spatial concepts, such as $\texttt{IsAmbulance}(\texttt{X})$ and $\texttt{IsClose}(\texttt{X}, \texttt{Y})$. These concepts are used to define FOL rules that govern the behavior of various agents. Since the concepts and rules are abstractions, they can be universally applied to cities with any agent compositions, facilitating the instantiation of diverse scenarios.Besides, a key feature of LogiCity is its support for user-configurable abstractions, enabling customizable simulation complexities for logical reasoning.To explore various aspects of NeSy AI, LogiCity introduces two tasks, one features long-horizon sequential decision-making, and the other focuses on one-step visual reasoning, varying in difficulty and agent behaviors.Our extensive evaluation reveals the advantage of NeSy frameworks in abstract reasoning. Moreover, we highlight the significant challenges of handling more complex abstractions in long-horizon multi-agent scenarios or under high-dimensional, imbalanced data.With its flexible design, various features, and newly raised challenges, we believe LogiCity represents a pivotal step forward in advancing the next generation of NeSy AI.All the code and data are open-sourced at our website."
Poster,Loki: Low-rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93430,"Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, Soheil Feizi, Abhinav Bhatele","Inference on large language models (LLMs) can be expensive in terms of thecompute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths areused. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in LLM inference contributessignificantly to these costs, which has sparked an interest in approximating the self-attention computation to reduce such costs. In this work, we propose to approximateself-attention by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in theattention block. Our analysis reveals that key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting thisobservation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selectstokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensionalspace. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to speed up the attention computationdue to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs while maintainingthe efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods."
Poster,Long-form factuality in large language models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96675,"Jerry Wei, Chengrun Yang, Xinying Song, Yifeng Lu, Nathan Hu, Jie Huang, Dustin Tran, Daiyi Peng, Ruibo Liu, Da Huang, Cosmo Du, Quoc V Le","Large language models (LLMs) often generate content that contains factual errors when responding to fact-seeking prompts on open-ended topics. To benchmark a model’s long-form factuality in open domains, we first use GPT-4 to generate LongFact, a prompt set comprising thousands of questions spanning 38 topics. We then propose that LLM agents can be used as automated evaluators for long-form factuality through a method which we call Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator (SAFE). SAFE utilizes an LLM to break down a long-form response into a set of individual facts and to evaluate the accuracy of each fact using a multi-step reasoning process comprising sending search queries to Google Search and determining whether a fact is supported by the search results. Furthermore, we propose extending F1 score as an aggregated metric for long-form factuality. To do so, we balance the percentage of supported facts in a response (precision) with the percentage of provided facts relative to a hyperparameter representing a user’s preferred response length (recall).Empirically, we demonstrate that LLM agents can outperform crowdsourced human annotators—on a set of∼16k individual facts, SAFE agrees with crowdsourced human annotators 72% of the time, and on a random subset of 100 disagreement cases, SAFE wins 76% of the time. At the same time, SAFE is more than 20 times cheaper than human annotators.  We also benchmark thirteen language models on LongFact across four model families (Gemini, GPT, Claude, and PaLM-2), finding that larger language models generally achieve better long-form factuality. LongFact, SAFE, and all experimental code are available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/long-form-factuality."
Poster,Long-Horizon Planning for Multi-Agent Robots in Partially Observable Environments,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94727,"Sid Nayak, Adelmo Morrison Orozco, Marina Have, Jackson Zhang, Vittal Thirumalai, Darren Chen, Aditya Kapoor, Eric Robinson, Karthik Gopalakrishnan, James Harrison, Anuj Mahajan, Brian Ichter, Hamsa Balakrishnan","The ability of Language Models (LMs) to understand natural language makes them a powerful tool for parsing human instructions into task plans for autonomous robots. Unlike traditional planning methods that rely on domain-specific knowledge and handcrafted rules, LMs generalize from diverse data and adapt to various tasks with minimal tuning, acting as a compressed knowledge base. However, LMs in their standard form face challenges with long-horizon tasks, particularly in partially observable multi-agent settings. We propose an LM-based Long-Horizon Planner for Multi-Agent Robotics (LLaMAR), a cognitive architecture for planning that achieves state-of-the-art results in long-horizon tasks within partially observable environments. LLaMAR employs a plan-act-correct-verify framework, allowing self-correction from action execution feedback without relying on oracles or simulators. Additionally, we present MAP-THOR, a comprehensive test suite encompassing household tasks of varying complexity within the AI2-THOR environment. Experiments show that LLaMAR achieves a 30\% higher success rate than other state-of-the-art LM-based multi-agent planners in MAP-THOR and Search \& Rescue tasks.

Poster,Long-range Brain Graph Transformer,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94190,"Shuo Yu, Shan Jin, Ming Li, Tabinda Sarwar, Feng Xia","Understanding communication and information processing among brain regions of interest (ROIs) is highly dependent on long-range connectivity, which plays a crucial role in facilitating diverse functional neural integration across the entire brain. However, previous studies generally focused on the short-range dependencies within brain networks while neglecting the long-range dependencies, limiting an integrated understanding of brain-wide communication. To address this limitation, we propose Adaptive Long-range aware TransformER (ALTER), a brain graph transformer to capture long-range dependencies between brain ROIs utilizing biased random walk. Specifically, we present a novel long-range aware strategy to explicitly capture long-range dependencies between brain ROIs. By guiding the walker towards the next hop with higher correlation value, our strategy simulates the real-world brain-wide communication. Furthermore, by employing the transformer framework, ALERT adaptively integrates both short- and long-range dependencies between brain ROIs, enabling an integrated understanding of multi-level communication across the entire brain. Extensive experiments on ABIDE and ADNI datasets demonstrate that ALTER consistently outperforms generalized state-of-the-art graph learning methods (including SAN, Graphormer, GraphTrans, and LRGNN) and other graph learning based brain network analysis methods (including FBNETGEN, BrainNetGNN, BrainGNN, and BrainNETTF) in neurological disease diagnosis."
Poster,Long-Range Feedback Spiking Network Captures Dynamic and Static Representations of the Visual Cortex under Movie Stimuli,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94454,"Liwei Huang, Zhengyu Ma, Liutao Yu, Huihui Zhou, Yonghong Tian","Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used models for investigating biological visual representations. However, existing DNNs are mostly designed to analyze neural responses to static images, relying on feedforward structures and lacking physiological neuronal mechanisms. There is limited insight into how the visual cortex represents natural movie stimuli that contain context-rich information. To address these problems, this work proposes the long-range feedback spiking network (LoRaFB-SNet), which mimics top-down connections between cortical regions and incorporates spike information processing mechanisms inherent to biological neurons. Taking into account the temporal dependence of representations under movie stimuli, we present Time-Series Representational Similarity Analysis (TSRSA) to measure the similarity between model representations and visual cortical representations of mice. LoRaFB-SNet exhibits the highest level of representational similarity, outperforming other well-known and leading alternatives across various experimental paradigms, especially when representing long movie stimuli. We further conduct experiments to quantify how temporal structures (dynamic information) and static textures (static information) of the movie stimuli influence representational similarity, suggesting that our model benefits from long-range feedback to encode context-dependent representations just like the brain. Altogether, LoRaFB-SNet is highly competent in capturing both dynamic and static representations of the mouse visual cortex and contributes to the understanding of movie processing mechanisms of the visual system.

Poster,Long-range Meta-path Search on Large-scale Heterogeneous Graphs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94053,"Chao Li, Zijie Guo, qiuting he, Kun He","Utilizing long-range dependency, a concept extensively studied in homogeneous graphs, remains underexplored in heterogeneous graphs, especially on large ones, posing two significant challenges: Reducing computational costs while maximizing effective information utilization in the presence of heterogeneity, and overcoming the over-smoothing issue in graph neural networks. To address this gap, we investigate the importance of different meta-paths and introduce an automatic framework for utilizing long-range dependency on heterogeneous graphs, denoted as Long-range Meta-path Search through Progressive Sampling (LMSPS). Specifically, we develop a search space with all meta-paths related to the target node type. By employing a progressive sampling algorithm, LMSPS dynamically shrinks the search space with hop-independent time complexity. Through a sampling evaluation strategy, LMSPS conducts a specialized and effective meta-path selection, leading to retraining with only effective meta-paths, thus mitigating costs and over-smoothing. Extensive experiments across diverse heterogeneous datasets validate LMSPS's capability in discovering effective long-range meta-paths, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/JHL-HUST/LMSPS."
