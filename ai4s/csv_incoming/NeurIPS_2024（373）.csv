Poster,SmallToLarge (S2L): Scalable Data Selection for Fine-tuning Large Language Models by Summarizing Training Trajectories of Small Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95679,"Yu Yang, Siddhartha Mishra, Jeffrey Chiang, Baharan Mirzasoleiman","Despite the effectiveness of data selection for pretraining and instruction fine-tuninglarge language models (LLMs), improving data efficiency in supervised fine-tuning(SFT) for specialized domains poses significant challenges due to the complexityof fine-tuning data. To bridge this gap, we introduce an effective and scalabledata selection method for SFT, SmallToLarge (S2L), which trains a smallmodel, clusters loss trajectories of the examples, and samples from these clusters toguide data selection for larger models. We prove that during fine-tuning, sampleswithin the same loss trajectory cluster exhibit similar gradients. Then, we showthat S2L subsets have a bounded gradient error w.r.t. the full data, hence guaranteeconvergence to the neighborhood of the optimal solution. We demonstrate throughextensive experiments that S2L significantly improves data efficiency in SFT formathematical problem-solving, reducing the training data requirement to just $11$%of the original MathInstruct dataset to match full dataset performance whileoutperforming state-of-the-art data selection algorithms by an average of $4.7$%across $6$ in- and out-domain evaluation datasets. Remarkably, selecting only 50Kdata for SFT, S2L achieves a $32.7$% accuracy on the challenging MATHbenchmark, improving Phi-2 by $16.6$%. In clinical text summarization on theMIMIC-III dataset, S2L again outperforms training on the full dataset usingonly $50$% of the data. Notably, S2L can perform scalable data selection using areference model $100\times$ smaller than the target model, proportionally reducing thecomputational cost."
Poster,SMART: Scalable Multi-agent Real-time Motion Generation via Next-token Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96788,"Wei Wu, Xiaoxin Feng, Ziyan Gao, Yuheng KAN","Data-driven autonomous driving motion generation tasks are frequently impacted by the limitations of dataset size and the domain gap between datasets, which precludes their extensive application in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce SMART, a novel autonomous driving motion generation paradigm that models vectorized map and agent trajectory data into discrete sequence tokens. These tokens are then processed through a decoder-only transformer architecture to train for the next token prediction task across spatial-temporal series. This GPT-style method allows the model to learn the motion distribution in real driving scenarios. SMART achieves state-of-the-art performance across most of the metrics on the generative Sim Agents challenge, ranking 1st on the leaderboards of Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), demonstrating remarkable inference speed. Moreover, SMART represents the generative model in the autonomous driving motion domain, exhibiting zero-shot generalization capabilities: Using only the NuPlan dataset for training and WOMD for validation, SMART achieved a competitive score of 0.72 on the Sim Agents challenge. Lastly, we have collected over 1 billion motion tokens from multiple datasets, validating the model's scalability. These results suggest that SMART has initially emulated two important properties: scalability and zero-shot generalization, and preliminarily meets the needs of large-scale real-time simulation applications. We have released all the code to promote the exploration of models for motion generation in the autonomous driving field. The source code is available at https://github.com/rainmaker22/SMART."
Poster,SMART: Towards Pre-trained Missing-Aware Model for Patient Health Status Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96447,"Zhihao Yu, Chu Xu, Yujie Jin, Yasha Wang, Junfeng Zhao","Electronic health record (EHR) data has emerged as a valuable resource for analyzing patient health status. However, the prevalence of missing data in EHR poses significant challenges to existing methods, leading to spurious correlations and suboptimal predictions. While various imputation techniques have been developed to address this issue, they often obsess difficult-to-interpolate details and may introduce additional noise when making clinical predictions. To tackle this problem, we propose SMART, a Self-Supervised Missing-Aware RepresenTation Learning approach for patient health status prediction, which encodes missing information via missing-aware temporal and variable attentions and learns to impute missing values through a novel self-supervised pre-training approach which reconstructs missing data representations in the latent space rather than in input space as usual. By adopting elaborated attentions and focusing on learning higher-order representations, SMART promotes better generalization and robustness to missing data. We validate the effectiveness of SMART through extensive experiments on six EHR tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art methods."
Poster,Sm: enhanced localization in Multiple Instance Learning for medical imaging classification,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94011,"Francisco M. Castro-Macías, Pablo Morales Alvarez, Yunan Wu, Rafael Molina, Aggelos Katsaggelos","Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is widely used in medical imaging classification to reduce the labeling effort. While only bag labels are available for training, one typically seeks predictions at both bag and instance levels (classification and localization tasks, respectively). Early MIL methods treated the instances in a bag independently. Recent methods account for global and local dependencies among instances. Although they have yielded excellent results in classification, their performance in terms of localization is comparatively limited. We argue that these models have been designed to target the classification task, while implications at the instance level have not been deeply investigated. Motivated by a simple observation -- that neighboring instances are likely to have the same label -- we propose a novel, principled, and flexible mechanism to model local dependencies. It can be used alone or combined with any mechanism to model global dependencies (e.g., transformers). A thorough empirical validation shows that our module leads to state-of-the-art performance in localization while being competitive or superior in classification.

Poster,Smoke and Mirrors in Causal Downstream Tasks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95749,"Riccardo Cadei, Lukas Lindorfer, Sylvia Cremer, Cordelia Schmid, Francesco Locatello","Machine Learning and AI have the potential to transform data-driven scientific discovery, enabling accurate predictions for several scientific phenomena. As many scientific questions are inherently causal, this paper looks at the causal inference task of treatment effect estimation, where the outcome of interest is recorded in high-dimensional observations in a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). Despite being the simplest possible causal setting and a perfect fit for deep learning, we theoretically find that many common choices in the literature may lead to biased estimates. To test the practical impact of these considerations, we recorded ISTAnt, the first real-world benchmark for causal inference downstream tasks on high-dimensional observations as an RCT studying how garden ants (Lasius neglectus) respond to microparticles applied onto their colony members by hygienic grooming. Comparing 6 480 models fine-tuned from state-of-the-art visual backbones, we find that the sampling and modeling choices significantly affect the accuracy of the causal estimate, and that classification accuracy is not a proxy thereof. We further validated the analysis, repeating it on a synthetically generated visual data set controlling the causal model. Our results suggest that future benchmarks should carefully consider real downstream scientific questions, especially causal ones. Further, we highlight guidelines for representation learning methods to help answer causal questions in the sciences."
Poster,S-MolSearch: 3D Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning for Bioactive Molecule Search,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93161,"Gengmo Zhou, Zhen Wang, Feng Yu, Guolin Ke, Zhewei Wei, Zhifeng Gao","Virtual Screening is an essential technique in the early phases of drug discovery, aimed at identifying promising drug candidates from vast molecular libraries. Recently, ligand-based virtual screening has garnered significant attention due to its efficacy in conducting extensive database screenings without relying on specific protein-binding site information.Obtaining binding affinity data for complexes is highly expensive, resulting in a limited amount of available data that covers a relatively small chemical space. Moreover, these datasets contain a significant amount of inconsistent noise. It is challenging to identify an inductive bias that consistently maintains the integrity of molecular activity during data augmentation. To tackle these challenges, we propose S-MolSearch, the first framework to our knowledge, that leverages molecular 3D information and affinity information in semi-supervised contrastive learning for ligand-based virtual screening. % S-MolSearch processes both labeled and unlabeled data, trains molecular structural encoders, and generates soft labels for unlabeled data, drawing on the principles of inverse optimal transport.Drawing on the principles of inverse optimal transport, S-MolSearch efficiently processes both labeled and unlabeled data, training molecular structural encoders while generating soft labels for the unlabeled data.This design allows S-MolSearch to adaptively utilize unlabeled data within the learning process.Empirically, S-MolSearch demonstrates superior performance on widely-used benchmarks LIT-PCBA and DUD-E. It surpasses both structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening methods for AUROC, BEDROC and EF."
Poster,Smoothed Energy Guidance: Guiding Diffusion Models with Reduced Energy Curvature of Attention,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95721,Susung Hong,"Conditional diffusion models have shown remarkable success in visual content generation, producing high-quality samples across various domains, largely due to classifier-free guidance (CFG). Recent attempts to extend guidance to unconditional models have relied on heuristic techniques, resulting in suboptimal generation quality and unintended effects. In this work, we propose Smoothed Energy Guidance (SEG), a novel training- and condition-free approach that leverages the energy-based perspective of the self-attention mechanism to enhance image generation. By defining the energy of self-attention, we introduce a method to reduce the curvature of the energy landscape of attention and use the output as the unconditional prediction. Practically, we control the curvature of the energy landscape by adjusting the Gaussian kernel parameter while keeping the guidance scale parameter fixed. Additionally, we present a query blurring method that is equivalent to blurring the entire attention weights without incurring quadratic complexity in the number of tokens. In our experiments, SEG achieves a Pareto improvement in both quality and the reduction of side effects. The code is available at https://github.com/SusungHong/SEG-SDXL."
Poster,Smoothed Online Classification can be Harder than Batch Classification,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95442,"Vinod Raman, Unique Subedi, Ambuj Tewari","We study online classification under smoothed adversaries. In this setting, at each time point, the adversary draws an example from a distribution that has a bounded density with respect to a fixed base measure, which is known apriori to the learner. For binary classification and scalar-valued regression, previous works [Haghtalab et al., 2020, Block et al., 2022] have shown that smoothed online learning is as easy as learning in the iid batch setting under PAC model. However, we show that smoothed online classification can be harder than the iid batch classification when the label space is unbounded. In particular, we construct a hypothesis class that is learnable in the iid batch setting under the PAC model but is not learnable under the smoothed online model. Finally, we identify a condition that ensures that the PAC learnability of a hypothesis class is sufficient for its smoothed online learnability."
Poster,Smoothie: Label Free Language Model Routing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93556,"Neel Guha, Mayee Chen, Trevor Chow, Ishan Khare, Christopher Ré","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in applications where LLM inputs may span many different tasks. Recent work has found that the choice of LLM is consequential, and different LLMs may be good for different input samples. Prior approaches have thus explored how engineers might select an LLM to use for each sample (i.e. _routing_). While existing routing methods mostly require training auxiliary models on human-annotated data, our work explores whether it is possible to perform _unsupervised_ routing. We propose Smoothie, a weak supervision-inspired routing approach that requires no labeled data. Given a set of outputs from different LLMs, Smoothie constructs a latent variable graphical model over embedding representations of observable LLM outputs and unknown “true” outputs. Using this graphical model, we estimate sample-dependent quality scores for each LLM, and route each sample to the LLM with the highest corresponding score. We find that Smoothie's LLM quality-scores correlate with ground-truth model quality (correctly identifying the optimal model on 9/14 tasks), and that Smoothie outperforms baselines for routing by up to 10 points accuracy."
Poster,SnapKV: LLM Knows What You are Looking for Before Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93531,"Yuhong Li, Yingbing Huang, Bowen Yang, Bharat Venkitesh, Acyr Locatelli, Hanchen Ye, Tianle Cai, Patrick Lewis, Deming Chen","Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in processing extensive contexts, with the Key-Value (KV) cache playing a vital role in enhancing their performance. However, the growth of the KV cache in response to increasing input length poses challenges to memory and time efficiency. To address this problem, this paper introduces SnapKV, an innovative and fine-tuning-free approach that efficiently minimizes KV cache size while still delivering comparable performance in real-world applications.We discover that each attention head in the model consistently focuses on specific prompt attention features during generation. Meanwhile, this robust pattern can be obtained from an `observation' window located at the end of the prompts. Drawing on this insight, SnapKV automatically compresses KV caches by selecting clustered important KV positions for each attention head. Our approach significantly reduces the growing computational overhead and memory footprint when processing long input sequences. Specifically, SnapKV achieves a consistent decoding speed with a 3.6x increase in generation speed and an 8.2x enhancement in memory efficiency compared to baseline when processing inputs of 16K tokens. At the same time, it maintains comparable performance to baseline models across 16 long sequence datasets. Moreover, SnapKV can process up to 380K context tokens on a single A100-80GB GPU using HuggingFace implementation with minor changes, exhibiting only a negligible accuracy drop in the Needle-in-a-Haystack test. Further comprehensive studies suggest SnapKV's potential for practical applications."
