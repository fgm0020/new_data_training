Poster,Boosting the Potential of Large Language Models with an Intelligent Information Assistant,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93615,"Yujia Zhou, Zheng Liu, Zhicheng Dou","The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced natural language processing, but these models often generate factually incorrect information, known as ""hallucination."" Initial retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods like the ""Retrieve-Read"" framework was inadequate for complex reasoning tasks. Subsequent prompt-based RAG strategies and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods improved performance but required frequent retraining and risked altering foundational LLM capabilities. To cope with these challenges, we propose Assistant-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (AssistRAG), integrating an intelligent information assistant within LLMs. This assistant manages memory and knowledge through tool usage, action execution, memory building, and plan specification. Using a two-phase training approach—Curriculum Assistant Learning and Reinforced Preference Optimization—AssistRAG enhances information retrieval and decision-making. Experiments show AssistRAG significantly outperforms benchmarks, especially benefiting less advanced LLMs, by providing superior reasoning capabilities and accurate responses."
Poster,Boosting the Transferability of Adversarial Attack on Vision Transformer with Adaptive Token Tuning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93393,"Di Ming, Peng Ren, Yunlong Wang, Xin Feng","Vision transformers (ViTs) perform exceptionally well in various computer vision tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Recent studies have shown that the transferability of adversarial examples exists for CNNs, and the same holds true for ViTs. However, existing ViT attacks aggressively regularize the largest token gradients to exact zero within each layer of the surrogate model, overlooking the interactions between layers, which limits their transferability in attacking black-box models. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on boosting the transferability of adversarial attacks on ViTs through adaptive token tuning (ATT). Specifically, we propose three optimization strategies: an adaptive gradient re-scaling strategy to reduce the overall variance of token gradients, a self-paced patch out strategy to enhance the diversity of input tokens, and a hybrid token gradient truncation strategy to weaken the effectiveness of attention mechanism. We demonstrate that scaling correction of gradient changes using gradient variance across different layers can produce highly transferable adversarial examples. In addition, introducing attentional truncation can mitigate the overfitting over complex interactions between tokens in deep ViT layers to further improve the transferability. On the other hand, using feature importance as a guidance to discard a subset of perturbation patches in each iteration, along with combining self-paced learning and progressively more sampled attacks, significantly enhances the transferability over attacks that use all perturbation patches. Extensive experiments conducted on ViTs, undefended CNNs, and defended CNNs validate the superiority of our proposed ATT attack method. On average, our approach improves the attack performance by 10.1% compared to state-of-the-art transfer-based attacks. Notably, we achieve the best attack performance with an average of 58.3% on three defended CNNs. Code is available at https://github.com/MisterRpeng/ATT."
Poster,Boosting Transferability and Discriminability for Time Series Domain Adaptation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94429,"Mingyang Liu, Xinyang Chen, Yang Shu, Xiucheng Li, Weili Guan, Liqiang Nie","Unsupervised domain adaptation excels in transferring knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, playing a critical role in time series applications. Existing time series domain adaptation methods either ignore frequency features or treat temporal and frequency features equally, which makes it challenging to fully exploit the advantages of both types of features. In this paper, we delve into transferability and discriminability, two crucial properties in transferable representation learning. It's insightful to note that frequency features are more discriminative within a specific domain, while temporal features show better transferability across domains. Based on the findings, we propose **A**dversarial **CO**-learning **N**etworks (**ACON**), to enhance transferable representation learning through a collaborative learning manner in three aspects: (1) Considering the multi-periodicity in time series, multi-period frequency feature learning is proposed to enhance the discriminability of frequency features; (2) Temporal-frequency domain mutual learning is proposed to enhance the discriminability of temporal features in the source domain and improve the transferability of frequency features in the target domain; (3) Domain adversarial learning is conducted in the correlation subspaces of temporal-frequency features instead of original feature spaces to further enhance the transferability of both features. Extensive experiments conducted on a wide range of time series datasets and five common applications demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ACON.

Poster,Boosting Vision-Language Models with Transduction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94116,"Maxime Zanella, Benoît Gérin, Ismail Ayed","Transduction is a powerful paradigm that leverages the structure of unlabeled data to boost predictive accuracy. We present TransCLIP, a novel and computationally efficient transductive approach designed for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). TransCLIP is applicable as a plug-and-play module on top of popular inductive zero- and few-shot models, consistently improving their performances. Our new objective function can be viewed as a regularized maximum-likelihood estimation, constrained by a KL divergence penalty that integrates the text-encoder knowledge and guides the transductive learning process. We further derive an iterative Block Majorize-Minimize (BMM) procedure for optimizing our objective, with guaranteed convergence and decoupled sample-assignment updates, yielding computationally efficient transduction for large-scale datasets. We report comprehensive evaluations, comparisons, and ablation studies that demonstrate: (i) Transduction can greatly enhance the generalization capabilities of inductive pretrained zero- and few-shot VLMs; (ii) TransCLIP substantially outperforms standard transductive few-shot learning methods relying solely on vision features, notably due to the KL-based language constraint."
Poster,Boosting Weakly Supervised Referring Image Segmentation via Progressive Comprehension,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95475,"Zaiquan Yang, Yuhao LIU, Jiaying Lin, Gerhard Hancke, Rynson Lau","This paper explores the weakly-supervised referring image segmentation (WRIS) problem, and focuses on a challenging setup where target localization is learned directly from image-text pairs. We note that the input text description typically already contains detailed information on how to localize the target object, and we also observe that humans often follow a step-by-step comprehension process (\ie, progressively utilizing target-related attributes and relations as cues) to identify the target object. Hence, we propose a novel Progressive Comprehension Network (PCNet) to leverage target-related textual cues from the input description for progressively localizing the target object.Specifically, we first use a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose the input text description into short phrases. These short phrases are taken as target-related cues and fed into a Conditional Referring Module (CRM) in multiple stages, to allow updating the referring text embedding and enhance the response map for target localization in a multi-stage manner.Based on the CRM, we then propose a Region-aware Shrinking (RaS) loss to constrain the visual localization to be conducted progressively in a coarse-to-fine manner across different stages.Finally, we introduce an Instance-aware Disambiguation (IaD) loss to suppress instance localization ambiguity by differentiating overlapping response maps generated by different referring texts on the same image. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms SOTA methods on three common benchmarks."
Poster,Bootstrapping Top-down Information for Self-modulating Slot Attention,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96618,"Dongwon Kim, Seoyeon Kim, Suha Kwak","Object-centric learning (OCL) aims to learn representations of individual objects within visual scenes without manual supervision, facilitating efficient and effective visual reasoning. Traditional OCL methods primarily employ bottom-up approaches that aggregate homogeneous visual features to represent objects. However, in complex visual environments, these methods often fall short due to the heterogeneous nature of visual features within an object. To address this, we propose a novel OCL framework incorporating a top-down pathway. This pathway first bootstraps the semantics of individual objects and then modulates the model to prioritize features relevant to these semantics. By dynamically modulating the model based on its own output, our top-down pathway enhances the representational quality of objects. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple synthetic and real-world object-discovery benchmarks."
Poster,Boundary Decomposition for Nadir Objective Vector Estimation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94228,"Ruihao Zheng, Zhenkun Wang","The nadir objective vector plays a key role in solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), where it is often used to normalize the objective space and guide the search. The current methods for estimating the nadir objective vector perform effectively only on specific MOPs. This paper reveals the limitations of these methods: exact methods can only work on discrete MOPs, while heuristic methods cannot deal with the MOP with a complicated feasible objective region. To fill this gap, we propose a general and rigorous method, namely boundary decomposition for nadir objective vector estimation (BDNE). BDNE scalarizes the MOP into a set of boundary subproblems. By utilizing bilevel optimization, boundary subproblems are optimized and adjusted alternately, thereby refining their optimal solutions to align with the nadir objective vector. We prove that the bilevel optimization identifies the nadir objective vector under mild conditions. We compare BDNE with existing methods on various black-box MOPs. The results conform to the theoretical analysis and show the significant potential of BDNE for real-world application."
Poster,Boundary Matters: A Bi-Level Active Finetuning Method,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96700,"Han Lu, Yichen Xie, Xiaokang Yang, Junchi Yan","The pretraining-finetuning paradigm has gained widespread adoption in vision tasks and other fields. However, the finetuning phase still requires high-quality annotated samples. To overcome this challenge, the concept of active finetuning has emerged, aiming to select the most appropriate samples for model finetuning within a limited budget. Existing active learning methods  struggle in this scenario due to their inherent bias in batch selection. Meanwhile, the recent active finetuning approach focuses solely on global distribution alignment but neglects the contributions of samples to local boundaries. Therefore, we propose a Bi-Level Active Finetuning framework (BiLAF) to select the samples for annotation in one shot, encompassing two stages: core sample selection for global diversity and boundary sample selection for local decision uncertainty. Without the need of ground-truth labels, our method can successfully identify pseudo-class centers, apply a novel denoising technique, and iteratively select boundary samples  with designed evaluation metric. Extensive experiments provide  qualitative and quantitative evidence of our method's superior efficacy, consistently outperforming the existing baselines."
Poster,Bounds for the smallest eigenvalue of the NTK for arbitrary spherical data of arbitrary dimension,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93764,"Kedar Karhadkar, Michael Murray, Guido Montufar","Bounds on the smallest eigenvalue of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) are a key ingredient in the analysis of neural network optimization and memorization. However, existing results require distributional assumptions on the data and are limited to a high-dimensional setting, where the input dimension $d_0$ scales at least logarithmically in the number of samples $n$. In this work we remove both of these requirements and instead provide bounds in terms of a measure of distance between data points: notably these bounds hold with high probability even when $d_0$ is held constant versus $n$. We prove our results through a novel application of the hemisphere transform."
Poster,BPQP: A Differentiable Convex Optimization Framework for Efficient End-to-End Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94911,"Jianming Pan, Zeqi Ye, Xiao Yang, Xu Yang, Weiqing Liu, Lewen Wang, Jiang Bian","Data-driven decision-making processes increasingly utilize end-to-end learnable deep neural networks to render final decisions. Sometimes, the output of the forward functions in certain layers is determined by the solutions to mathematical optimization problems, leading to the emergence of differentiable optimization layers that permit gradient back-propagation.However, real-world scenarios often involve large-scale datasets and numerous constraints, presenting significant challenges. Current methods for differentiating optimization problems typically rely on implicit differentiation, which necessitates costly computations on the Jacobian matrices, resulting in low efficiency.In this paper, we introduce BPQP, a differentiable convex optimization framework designed for efficient end-to-end learning. To enhance efficiency, we reformulate the backward pass as a simplified and decoupled quadratic programming problem by leveraging the structural properties of the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) matrix. This reformulation enables the use of first-order optimization algorithms in calculating the backward pass gradients, allowing our framework to potentially utilize any state-of-the-art solver. As solver technologies evolve, BPQP can continuously adapt and improve its efficiency.Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that BPQP achieves a significant improvement in efficiency—typically an order of magnitude faster in overall execution time compared to other differentiable optimization layers. Our results not only highlight the efficiency gains of BPQP but also underscore its superiority over differential optimization layer baselines."
