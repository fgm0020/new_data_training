Poster,UnlearnCanvas:  Stylized Image Dataset for Enhanced Machine Unlearning Evaluation in Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97469,"Yihua Zhang, Chongyu Fan, Yimeng Zhang, Yuguang Yao, Jinghan Jia, Jiancheng Liu, Gaoyuan Zhang, Gaowen Liu, Ramana Kompella, Xiaoming Liu, Sijia Liu","The technological advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in text-to-image generation and are widely used in diverse applications. However, they have also raised significant societal concerns, such as the generation of harmful content and copyright disputes. Machine unlearning (MU) has emerged as a promising solution, capable of removing undesired generative capabilities from DMs. However, existing MU evaluation systems present several key challenges that can result in incomplete and inaccurate assessments. To address these issues, we propose UnlearnCanvas, a comprehensive high-resolution stylized image dataset that facilitates the evaluation of the unlearning of artistic styles and associated objects. This dataset enables the establishment of a standardized, automated evaluation framework with 7 quantitative metrics assessing various aspects of the unlearning performance for DMs. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark 9 state-of-the-art MU methods for DMs, revealing novel insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and underlying mechanisms. Additionally, we explore challenging unlearning scenarios for DMs to evaluate worst-case performance against adversarial prompts, the unlearning of finer-scale concepts, and sequential unlearning. We hope that this study can pave the way for developing more effective, accurate, and robust DM unlearning methods, ensuring safer and more ethical applications of DMs in the future. The dataset, benchmark, and codes are publicly available at this [link](https://unlearn-canvas.netlify.app/)."
Poster,Unleashing Multispectral Video's Potential in Semantic Segmentation: A Semi-supervised Viewpoint and New UAV-View Benchmark,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93562,"Wei Ji, Jingjing Li, Wenbo Li, Yilin Shen, Li cheng, Hongxia Jin","Thanks to the rapid progress in RGB & thermal imaging, also known as multispectral imaging, the task of multispectral video semantic segmentation, or MVSS in short, has recently drawn significant attentions. Noticeably, it offers new opportunities in improving segmentation performance under unfavorable visual conditions such as poor light or overexposure. Unfortunately, there are currently very few datasets available, including for example MVSeg dataset that focuses purely toward eye-level view; and it features the sparse annotation nature due to the intensive demands of labeling process. To address these key challenges of the MVSS task, this paper presents two major contributions: the introduction of MVUAV, a new MVSS benchmark dataset, and the development of a dedicated semi-supervised MVSS baseline - SemiMV. Our MVUAV dataset is captured via Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), which offers a unique oblique bird’s-eye view complementary to the existing MVSS datasets; it also encompasses a broad range of day/night lighting conditions and over 30 semantic categories. In the meantime, to better leverage the sparse annotations and extra unlabeled RGB-Thermal videos, a semi-supervised learning baseline, SemiMV, is proposed to enforce consistency regularization through a dedicated Cross-collaborative Consistency Learning (C3L) module and a denoised temporal aggregation strategy. Comprehensive empirical evaluations on both MVSeg and MVUAV benchmark datasets have showcased the efficacy of our SemiMV baseline."
Poster,Unleashing Region Understanding in Intermediate Layers for MLLM-based Referring Expression Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96885,"Yaoyuan Liang, Zhuojun Cai, Jian Xu, Guanbo Huang, Yiran Wang, Xiao Liang, Jiahao Liu, Ziran Li, Jingang Wang, Shao-Lun Huang","The Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) based Referring Expression Generation (REG) task has gained increasing popularity, which aims to generate an unambiguous text description that applies to exactly one object or region in the image by leveraging foundation models. We empirically found that there exists a potential trade-off between the detailedness and the correctness of the descriptions for the referring objects. On the one hand, generating sentences with more details is usually required in order to provide more precise object descriptions. On the other hand, complicated sentences could easily increase the probability of hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose a training-free framework, named ``unleash-then-eliminate'', which first elicits the latent information in the intermediate layers, and then adopts a cycle-consistency-based decoding method to alleviate the production of hallucinations. Furthermore, to reduce the computational load of cycle-consistency-based decoding, we devise a Probing-based Importance Estimation method to statistically estimate the importance weights of intermediate layers within a subset. These importance weights are then incorporated into the decoding process over the entire dataset, intervening in the next token prediction from intermediate layers.Extensive experiments conducted on the RefCOCOg and PHD benchmarks show that our proposed framework could outperform existing methods on both semantic and hallucination-related metrics. Code will be made available in https://github.com/Glupayy/unleash-eliminate."
Poster,Unleashing the Denoising Capability of Diffusion Prior for Solving Inverse Problems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96802,"Jiawei Zhang, Jiaxin Zhuang, Cheng Jin, Gen Li, Yuantao Gu","The recent emergence of diffusion models has significantly advanced the precision of learnable priors, presenting innovative avenues for addressing inverse problems. Previous works have endeavored to integrate diffusion priors into the maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) framework and design optimization methods to solve the inverse problem. However, prevailing optimization-based rithms primarily exploit the prior information within the diffusion models while neglecting their denoising capability. To bridge this gap, this work leverages the diffusion process to reframe noisy inverse problems as a two-variable constrained optimization task by introducing an auxiliary optimization variable that represents a 'noisy' sample at an equivalent denoising step. The projection gradient descent method is efficiently utilized to solve the corresponding optimization problem by truncating the gradient through the $\mu$-predictor. The proposed algorithm, termed ProjDiff, effectively harnesses the prior information and the denoising capability of a pre-trained diffusion model within the optimization framework. Extensive experiments on the image restoration tasks and source separation and partial generation tasks demonstrate that ProjDiff exhibits superior performance across various linear and nonlinear inverse problems, highlighting its potential for practical applications.

Poster,Unleashing the Potential of the Diffusion Model in Few-shot Semantic Segmentation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96767,"Muzhi Zhu, Yang Liu, Zekai Luo, Chenchen Jing, Hao Chen, Guangkai Xu, Xinlong Wang, Chunhua Shen","The Diffusion Model has not only garnered noteworthy achievements in the realm of image generation but has also demonstrated its potential as an effective pretraining method utilizing unlabeled data. Drawing from the extensive potential unveiled by the Diffusion Model in both semantic correspondence and open vocabulary segmentation, our work initiates an investigation into employing the Latent Diffusion Model for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation.Recently, inspired by the in-context learning ability of large language models, Few-shot Semantic Segmentation has evolved into In-context Segmentation tasks, morphing into a crucial element in assessing generalist segmentation models.In this context, we concentrate on Few-shot Semantic Segmentation, establishing a solid foundation for the future development of a Diffusion-based generalist model for segmentation. Our initial focus lies in understanding how to facilitate interaction between the query image and the support image, resulting in the proposal of a KV fusion method within the self-attention framework.Subsequently, we delve deeper into optimizing the infusion of information from the support mask and simultaneously re-evaluating how to provide reasonable supervision from the query mask.Based on our analysis, we establish a simple and effective framework named DiffewS, maximally retaining the original Latent Diffusion Model's generative framework and effectively utilizing the pre-training prior. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the previous SOTA models in multiple settings."
Poster,Unlocking the Capabilities of Masked Generative Models for Image Synthesis via Self-Guidance,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96852,"Jiwan Hur, DongJae Lee, Gyojin Han, Jaehyun Choi, Yunho Jeon, Junmo Kim","Masked generative models (MGMs) have shown impressive generative ability while providing an order of magnitude efficient sampling steps compared to continuous diffusion models. However, MGMs still underperform in image synthesis compared to recent well-developed continuous diffusion models with similar size in terms of quality and diversity of generated samples. A key factor in the performance of continuous diffusion models stems from the guidance methods, which enhance the sample quality at the expense of diversity. In this paper, we extend these guidance methods to generalized guidance formulation for MGMs and propose a self-guidance sampling method, which leads to better generation quality. The proposed approach leverages an auxiliary task for semantic smoothing in vector-quantized token space, analogous to the Gaussian blur in continuous pixel space. Equipped with the parameter-efficient fine-tuning method and high-temperature sampling, MGMs with the proposed self-guidance achieve a superior quality-diversity trade-off, outperforming existing sampling methods in MGMs with more efficient training and sampling costs. Extensive experiments with the various sampling hyperparameters confirm the effectiveness of the proposed self-guidance."
Poster,Unlocking the Capabilities of Thought: A Reasoning Boundary Framework to Quantify and Optimize Chain-of-Thought,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93575,"Qiguang Chen, Libo Qin, Jiaqi Wang, Jingxuan Zhou, Wanxiang Che","Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a promising approach for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Recently, a series of studies attempt to explain the mechanisms underlying CoT, aiming to deepen the understanding of its efficacy. Nevertheless, the existing research faces two major challenges: (1) a lack of quantitative metrics to assess CoT capabilities and (2) a dearth of guidance on optimizing CoT performance. Motivated by this, in this work, we introduce a novel reasoning boundary framework (RBF) to address these challenges. To solve the lack of quantification, we first define a reasoning boundary (RB) to quantify the upper-bound of CoT and establish a combination law for RB, enabling a practical quantitative approach applicable to various real-world CoT tasks. To address the lack of optimization, we propose three categories of RBs. We further optimize these categories with combination laws focused on RB promotion and reasoning path optimization for CoT improvement. Through extensive experiments on 27 models and 5 tasks, the study validates the existence and rationality of the proposed framework. Furthermore, it explains the effectiveness of 10 CoT strategies and guides optimization from two perspectives. We hope this work can provide a comprehensive understanding of the boundaries and optimization strategies for reasoning in LLMs. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/LightChen233/reasoning-boundary."
Poster,Unlocking the Potential of Global Human Expertise,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94038,"Elliot Meyerson, Olivier Francon, Darren Sargent, Babak Hodjat, Risto Miikkulainen","Solving societal problems on a global scale requires the collection and processing of ideas and methods from diverse sets of international experts. As the number and diversity of human experts increase, so does the likelihood that elements in this collective knowledge can be combined and refined to discover novel and better solutions. However, it is difficult to identify, combine, and refine complementary information in an increasingly large and diverse knowledge base. This paper argues that artificial intelligence (AI) can play a crucial role in this process. An evolutionary AI framework, termed RHEA, fills this role by distilling knowledge from diverse models created by human experts into equivalent neural networks, which are then recombined and refined in a population-based search. The framework was implemented in a formal synthetic domain, demonstrating that it is transparent and systematic. It was then applied to the results of the XPRIZE Pandemic Response Challenge, in which over 100 teams of experts across 23 countries submitted models based on diverse methodologies to predict COVID-19 cases and suggest non-pharmaceutical intervention policies for 235 nations, states, and regions across the globe. Building upon this expert knowledge, by recombining and refining the 169 resulting policy suggestion models, RHEA discovered a broader and more effective set of policies than either AI or human experts alone, as evaluated based on real-world data. The results thus suggest that AI can play a crucial role in realizing the potential of human expertise in global problem-solving."
Poster,Unlocking Tokens as Data Points for Generalization Bounds on Larger Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96574,"Sanae Lotfi, Yilun Kuang, Marc Finzi, Brandon Amos, Micah Goldblum, Andrew Wilson","Large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters excel at predicting the next token in a sequence. Recent work computes non-vacuous compression-based generalization bounds for LLMs, but these bounds are vacuous for large models at the billion-parameter scale. Moreover, these bounds are obtained through restrictive compression techniques, bounding compressed models that generate low-quality text. Additionally, the tightness of these existing bounds depends on the number of IID documents in a training set rather than the much larger number of non-IID constituent tokens, leaving untapped potential for tighter bounds. In this work, we instead use properties of martingales to derive generalization bounds that benefit from the vast number of tokens in LLM training sets. Since a dataset contains far more tokens than documents, our generalization bounds not only tolerate but actually benefit from far less restrictive compression schemes. With Monarch matrices, Kronecker factorizations, and post-training quantization, we achieve non-vacuous generalization bounds for LLMs as large as LLaMA2-70B. Unlike previous approaches, our work achieves the first non-vacuous bounds for models that are deployed in practice and generate high-quality text."
Poster,Unlock the Intermittent Control Ability of Model Free Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94291,"Jiashun Liu, Jianye Hao, Xiaotian Hao, Yi Ma, YAN ZHENG, Yujing Hu, Tangjie Lv","Intermittent control problems are common in real world. The interactions between the decision maker and the executor can be discontinuous (intermittent) due to various types of interruptions, e.g. unstable communication channel. Due to intermittent interaction, agents are unable to acquire the state sent by the executor and cannot transmit actions to the executor within a period of time step, i.e. bidirectional blockage, which may lead to inefficiencies of reinforcement learning policies and prevent the executors from completing the task. Such problem is not well studied in the RL community. In this paper, we model Intermittent control problem as an Intermittent Control Markov Decision Process, i.e agents are expected to generate action sequences corresponding to the unavailable states and transmit them before disabling interactions to ensure the smooth and effective motion of executors. However, directly generating multiple future actions in the original action space has unnatural motion issue and exploration difficulty. We propose **M**ulti-step **A**ction **R**epre**S**entation (**MARS**), which encodes a sequence of actions from the original action space to a compact and decodable latent space. Then based on the latent action sequence representation, the mainstream RL methods can be easily optimized to learn a smooth and efficient motion policy. Extensive experiments on simulation tasks and real-world robotic grasping tasks show that MARS significantly improves the learning efficiency and final performances compared with existing baselines."
