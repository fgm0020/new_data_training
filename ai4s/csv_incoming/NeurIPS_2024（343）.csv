Poster,Rethinking Out-of-Distribution Detection on Imbalanced Data Distribution,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96028,"Kai Liu, Zhihang Fu, Sheng Jin, Chao Chen, Ze Chen, Rongxin Jiang, Fan Zhou, Yaowu Chen, Jieping Ye","Detecting and rejecting unknown out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is critical for deployed neural networks to void unreliable predictions. In real-world scenarios, however, the efficacy of existing OOD detection methods is often impeded by the inherent imbalance of in-distribution (ID) data, which causes significant performance decline. Through statistical observations, we have identified two common challenges faced by different OOD detectors: misidentifying tail class ID samples as OOD, while erroneously predicting OOD samples as head class from ID. To explain this phenomenon, we introduce a generalized statistical framework, termed ImOOD, to formulate the OOD detection problem on imbalanced data distribution. Consequently, the theoretical analysis reveals that there exists a class-aware bias item between balanced and imbalanced OOD detection, which contributes to the performance gap. Building upon this finding, we present a unified training-time regularization technique to mitigate the bias and boost imbalanced OOD detectors across architecture designs. Our theoretically grounded method translates into consistent improvements on the representative CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT benchmarks against several state-of-the-art OOD detection ap- proaches.

Poster,Rethinking Parity Check Enhanced Symmetry-Preserving Ansatz,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94566,"Ge Yan, Mengfei Ran, Ruocheng Wang, Kaisen Pan, Junchi Yan","With the arrival of the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have emerged to obtain possible quantum advantage. In particular, how to effectively incorporate hard constraints in VQAs remains a critical and open question. In this paper, we manage to combine the Hamming Weight Preserving ansatz with a topological-aware parity check on physical qubits to enforce error mitigation and further hard constraints. We demonstrate the combination significantly outperforms peer VQA methods on both quantum chemistry problems and constrained combinatorial optimization problems e.g. Quadratic Assignment Problem. Intensive experimental results on both simulators and superconducting quantum processors are provided to verify that the combination of HWP ansatz with parity check is among the most promising candidates to demonstrate quantum advantages in the NISQ era to solve more realistic problems."
Poster,Rethinking Reconstruction-based Graph-Level Anomaly Detection: Limitations and a Simple Remedy,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94301,"Sunwoo Kim, Soo Yong Lee, Fanchen Bu, Shinhwan Kang, Kyungho Kim, Jaemin Yoo, Kijung Shin","Graph autoencoders (Graph-AEs) learn representations of given graphs by aiming to accurately reconstruct them. A notable application of Graph-AEs is graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD), whose objective is to identify graphs with anomalous topological structures and/or node features compared to the majority of the graph population. Graph-AEs for GLAD regard a graph with a high mean reconstruction error (i.e. mean of errors from all node pairs and/or nodes) as anomalies. Namely, the methods rest on the assumption that they would better reconstruct graphs with similar characteristics to the majority. We, however, report non-trivial counter-examples, a phenomenon we call reconstruction flip, and highlight the limitations of the existing Graph-AE-based GLAD methods. Specifically, we empirically and theoretically investigate when this assumption holds and when it fails. Through our analyses, we further argue that, while the reconstruction errors for a given graph are effective features for GLAD, leveraging the multifaceted summaries of the reconstruction errors, beyond just mean, can further strengthen the features. Thus, we propose a novel and simple GLAD method, named MUSE. The key innovation of MUSE involves taking multifaceted summaries of reconstruction errors as graph features for GLAD. This surprisingly simple method obtains SOTA performance in GLAD, performing best overall among 14 methods across 10 datasets."
Poster,Rethinking Score Distillation as a Bridge Between Image Distributions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95788,"David McAllister, Songwei Ge, Jia-Bin Huang, David Jacobs, Alexei Efros, Aleksander Holynski, Angjoo Kanazawa","Score distillation sampling (SDS) has proven to be an important tool, enabling the use of large-scale diffusion priors for tasks operating in data-poor domains. Unfortunately, SDS has a number of characteristic artifacts that limit its utility in general-purpose applications. In this paper, we make progress toward understanding the behavior of SDS and its variants by viewing them as solving an optimal-cost transport path from some current source distribution to a target distribution. Under this new interpretation, we argue that these methods' characteristic artifacts are caused by (1) linear approximation of the optimal path and (2) poor estimates of the source distribution.We show that by calibrating the text conditioning of the source distribution, we can produce high-quality generation and translation results with little extra overhead. Our method can be easily applied across many domains, matching or beating the performance of specialized methods. We demonstrate its utility in text-to-2D, text-to-3D, translating paintings to real images, optical illusion generation, and 3D sketch-to-real. We compare our method to existing approaches for score distillation sampling and show that it can produce high-frequency details with realistic colors."
Poster,Rethinking the Capacity of Graph Neural Networks for Branching Strategy,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95991,"Ziang Chen, Jialin Liu, Xiaohan Chen, Wang, Wotao Yin","Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used to predict properties and heuristics of mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) and hence accelerate MILP solvers. This paper investigates the capacity of GNNs to represent strong branching (SB), the most effective yet computationally expensive heuristic employed in the branch-and-bound algorithm. In the literature, message-passing GNN (MP-GNN), as the simplest GNN structure, is frequently used as a fast approximation of SB and we find that not all MILPs's SB can be represented with MP-GNN. We precisely define a class of ""MP-tractable"" MILPs for which MP-GNNs can accurately approximate SB scores. Particularly, we establish a universal approximation theorem: for any data distribution over the MP-tractable class, there always exists an MP-GNN that can approximate the SB score with arbitrarily high accuracy and arbitrarily high probability, which lays a theoretical foundation of the existing works on imitating SB with MP-GNN. For MILPs without the MP-tractability, unfortunately, a similar result is impossible, which can be illustrated by two MILP instances with different SB scores that cannot be distinguished by any MP-GNN, regardless of the number of parameters. Recognizing this, we explore another GNN structure called the second-order folklore GNN (2-FGNN) that overcomes this limitation, and the aforementioned universal approximation theorem can be extended to the entire MILP space using 2-FGNN, regardless of the MP-tractability. A small-scale numerical experiment is conducted to directly validate our theoretical findings."
Poster,Rethinking the Diffusion Models for Missing Data Imputation: A Gradient Flow Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94215,"Zhichao Chen, Haoxuan Li, Fangyikang Wang, Odin Zhang, Hu Xu, Xiaoyu Jiang, Zhihuan Song, Hao Wang","Diffusion models have demonstrated competitive performance in missing data imputation (MDI) task. However, directly applying diffusion models to MDI produces suboptimal performance due to two primary defects. First, the sample diversity promoted by diffusion models hinders the accurate inference of missing values. Second, data masking reduces observable indices for model training, obstructing imputation performance. To address these challenges, we introduce $\underline{\text{N}}$egative $\underline{\text{E}}$ntropy-regularized $\underline{\text{W}}$asserstein gradient flow for $\underline{\text{Imp}}$utation (NewImp), enhancing diffusion models for MDI from a gradient flow perspective. To handle the first defect, we incorporate a negative entropy regularization term into the cost functional to suppress diversity and improve accuracy. To handle the second defect, we demonstrate that the imputation procedure of NewImp, induced by the conditional distribution-related cost functional, can equivalently be replaced by that induced by the joint distribution, thereby naturally eliminating the need for data masking. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. Code is available at [https://github.com/JustusvLiebig/NewImp](https://github.com/JustusvLiebig/NewImp)."
Poster,Rethinking the Evaluation of Out-of-Distribution Detection: A Sorites Paradox,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97509,"Xingming Long, Jie Zhang, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen","Most existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmarks classify samples with novel labels as the OOD data. However, some marginal OOD samples actually have close semantic contents to the in-distribution (ID) sample, which makes determining the OOD sample a Sorites Paradox. In this paper, we construct a benchmark named Incremental Shift OOD (IS-OOD) to address the issue, in which we divide the test samples into subsets with different semantic and covariate shift degrees relative to the ID dataset. The data division is achieved through a shift measuring method based on our proposed Language Aligned Image feature Decomposition (LAID). Moreover, we construct a Synthetic Incremental Shift (Syn-IS) dataset that contains high-quality generated images with more diverse covariate contents to complement the IS-OOD benchmark. We evaluate current OOD detection methods on our benchmark and find several important insights: (1) The performance of most OOD detection methods significantly improves as the semantic shift increases; (2) Some methods like GradNorm may have different OOD detection mechanisms as they rely less on semantic shifts to make decisions; (3) Excessive covariate shifts in the image are also likely to be considered as OOD for some methods. Our code and data are released in https://github.com/qqwsad5/IS-OOD."
Poster,Rethinking the Membrane Dynamics and Optimization Objectives of Spiking Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96543,"Hangchi Shen, Qian Zheng, Huamin Wang, Gang Pan","Despite spiking neural networks (SNNs) have demonstrated notable energy efficiency across various fields, the limited firing patterns of spiking neurons within fixed time steps restrict the expression of information, which impedes further improvement of SNN performance. In addition, current implementations of SNNs typically consider the firing rate or average membrane potential of the last layer as the output, lacking exploration of other possibilities. In this paper, we identify that the limited spike patterns of spiking neurons stem from the initial membrane potential (IMP), which is set to 0. By adjusting the IMP, the spiking neurons can generate additional firing patterns and pattern mappings. Furthermore, we find that in static tasks, the accuracy of SNNs at each time step increases as the membrane potential evolves from zero. This observation inspires us to propose a learnable IMP, which can accelerate the evolution of membrane potential and enables higher performance within a limited number of time steps. Additionally, we introduce the last time step (LTS) approach to accelerate convergence in static tasks, and we propose a label smooth temporal efficient training (TET) loss to mitigate the conflicts between optimization objective and regularization term in the vanilla TET. Our methods improve the accuracy by 4.05\% on ImageNet compared to baseline and achieve state-of-the-art performance of 87.80\% on CIFAR10-DVS and 87.86\% on N-Caltech101."
Poster,Rethinking the Power of Timestamps for Robust Time Series Forecasting: A Global-Local Fusion Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96026,"Chengsen Wang, Qi Qi, Jingyu Wang, Haifeng Sun, Zirui Zhuang, Jinming Wu, Jianxin Liao","Time series forecasting has played a pivotal role across various industries, including finance, transportation, energy, healthcare, and climate. Due to the abundant seasonal information they contain, timestamps possess the potential to offer robust global guidance for forecasting techniques. However, existing works primarily focus on local observations, with timestamps being treated merely as an optional supplement that remains underutilized. When data gathered from the real world is polluted, the absence of global information will damage the robust prediction capability of these algorithms. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework named GLAFF. Within this framework, the timestamps are modeled individually to capture the global dependencies. Working as a plugin, GLAFF adaptively adjusts the combined weights for global and local information, enabling seamless collaboration with any time series forecasting backbone. Extensive experiments conducted on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that GLAFF significantly enhances the average performance of widely used mainstream forecasting models by 12.5\%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art method by 5.5\%."
Poster,Rethinking The Training And Evaluation of Rich-Context Layout-to-Image Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96399,"Jiaxin Cheng, ZIXU ZHAO, Tong He, Tianjun Xiao, Zheng Zhang, Yicong Zhou","Recent advancements in generative models have significantly enhanced their capacity for image generation, enabling a wide range of applications such as image editing, completion and video editing. A specialized area within generative modeling is layout-to-image (L2I) generation, where predefined layouts of objects guide the generative process. In this study, we introduce a novel regional cross-attention module tailored to enrich layout-to-image generation. This module notably improves the representation of layout regions, particularly in scenarios where existing methods struggle with highly complex and detailed textual descriptions. Moreover, while current open-vocabulary L2I methods are trained in an open-set setting, their evaluations often occur in closed-set environments. To bridge this gap, we propose two metrics to assess L2I performance in open-vocabulary scenarios. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive user study to validate the consistency of these metrics with human preferences."
