Poster,Shadowcast: Stealthy Data Poisoning Attacks Against Vision-Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95705,"Yuancheng Xu, Jiarui Yao, Manli Shu, Yanchao Sun, Zichu Wu, Ning Yu, Tom Goldstein, Furong Huang","Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in generating textual responses from visual inputs, but their versatility raises security concerns. This study takes the first step in exposing VLMs’ susceptibility to data poisoning attacks that can manipulate responses to innocuous, everyday prompts. We introduce Shadowcast, a stealthy data poisoning attack where poison samples are visually indistinguishable from benign images with matching texts. Shadowcast demonstrates effectiveness in two attack types. The first is a traditional Label Attack, tricking VLMs into misidentifying class labels, such as confusing Donald Trump for Joe Biden. The second is a novel Persuasion Attack, leveraging VLMs’ text generation capabilities to craft persuasive and seemingly rational narratives for misinformation, such as portraying junk food as healthy. We show that Shadowcast effectively achieves the attacker’s intentions using as few as 50 poison samples. Crucially, the poisoned samples demonstrate transferability across different VLM architectures, posing a significant concern in black-box settings. Moreover, Shadowcast remains potent under realistic conditions involving various text prompts, training data augmentation, and image compression techniques. This work reveals how poisoned VLMs can disseminate convincing yet deceptive misinformation to everyday, benign users, emphasizing the importance of data integrity for responsible VLM deployments.

Poster,Shadowheart SGD: Distributed Asynchronous SGD with Optimal Time Complexity Under Arbitrary Computation and Communication Heterogeneity,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95390,"Alexander Tyurin, Marta Pozzi, Ivan Ilin, Peter Richtarik","We consider nonconvex stochastic optimization problems in the asynchronous centralized distributed setup where the communication times from workers to a server can not be ignored, and the computation and communication times are potentially different for all workers. Using an unbiassed compression technique, we develop a new method—Shadowheart SGD—that provably improves the time complexities of all previous centralized methods. Moreover, we show that the time complexity of Shadowheart SGD is optimal in the family of centralized methods with compressed communication. We also consider the bidirectional setup, where broadcasting from the server to the workers is non-negligible, and develop a corresponding method."
Poster,Shape analysis for time series,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95718,"Thibaut Germain, Samuel Gruffaz, Charles Truong, Alain Durmus, Laurent Oudre","Analyzing inter-individual variability of physiological functions is particularly appealing in medical and biological contexts to describe or quantify health conditions. Such analysis can be done by comparing individuals to a reference one with time series as biomedical data.This paper introduces an unsupervised representation learning (URL) algorithm for time series tailored to inter-individual studies. The idea is to represent time series as deformations of a reference time series. The deformations are diffeomorphisms parameterized and learned by our method called TS-LDDMM. Once the deformations and the reference time series are learned, the vector representations of individual time series are given by the parametrization of their corresponding deformation. At the crossroads between URL for time series and shape analysis, the proposed algorithm handles irregularly sampled multivariate time series of variable lengths and provides shape-based representations of temporal data.In this work, we establish a representation theorem for the graph of a time series and derive its consequences on the LDDMM framework. We showcase the advantages of our representation compared to existing methods using synthetic data and real-world examples motivated by biomedical applications."
Poster,Shaping the distribution of neural responses with interneurons in a recurrent circuit model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93604,"David Lipshutz, Eero Simoncelli","Efficient coding theory posits that sensory circuits transform natural signals into neural representations that maximize information transmission subject to resource constraints. Local interneurons are thought to play an important role in these transformations, shaping patterns of circuit activity to facilitate and direct information flow. However, the relationship between these coordinated, nonlinear, circuit-level transformations and the properties of interneurons (e.g., connectivity, activation functions) remains unknown. Here, we propose a normative computational model that establishes such a relationship. Our model is derived from an optimal transport objective that conceptualizes the circuit's input-response function as transforming the inputs to achieve a target response distribution. The circuit, which is comprised of primary neurons that are recurrently connected to a set of local interneurons, continuously optimizes this objective by dynamically adjusting both the synaptic connections between neurons as well as the interneuron activation functions. In an application motivated by redundancy reduction theory, we demonstrate that when the inputs are natural image statistics and the target distribution is a spherical Gaussian, the circuit learns a nonlinear transformation that significantly reduces statistical dependencies in neural responses. Overall, our results provide a framework in which the distribution of circuit responses is systematically and nonlinearly controlled by adjustment of interneuron connectivity and activation functions."
Poster,shapiq: Shapley Interactions for Machine Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97533,"Maximilian Muschalik, Hubert Baniecki, Fabian Fumagalli, Patrick Kolpaczki, Barbara Hammer, Eyke Hüllermeier","Originally rooted in game theory, the Shapley Value (SV) has recently become an important tool in machine learning research. Perhaps most notably, it is used for feature attribution and data valuation in explainable artificial intelligence. Shapley Interactions (SIs) naturally extend the SV and address its limitations by assigning joint contributions to groups of entities, which enhance understanding of black box machine learning models. Due to the exponential complexity of computing SVs and SIs, various methods have been proposed that exploit structural assumptions or yield probabilistic estimates given limited resources. In this work, we introduce shapiq, an open-source Python package that unifies state-of-the-art algorithms to efficiently compute SVs and any-order SIs in an application-agnostic framework. Moreover, it includes a benchmarking suite containing 11 machine learning applications of SIs with pre-computed games and ground-truth values to systematically assess computational performance across domains. For practitioners, shapiq is able to explain and visualize any-order feature interactions in predictions of models, including vision transformers, language models, as well as XGBoost and LightGBM with TreeSHAP-IQ. With shapiq, we extend shap beyond feature attributions and consolidate the application of SVs and SIs in machine learning that facilitates future research.

Poster,Shared Autonomy with IDA: Interventional Diffusion Assistance,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93699,"Brandon McMahan, Zhenghao (Mark) Peng, Bolei Zhou, Jonathan Kao","The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has unearthed the potential to assist humans in controlling advanced technologies. Shared autonomy (SA) facilitates control by combining inputs from a human pilot and an AI copilot. In prior SA studies, the copilot is constantly active in determining the action played at each time step. This limits human autonomy that may have deleterious effects on performance. In general, the amount of helpful copilot assistance varies greatly depending on the task dynamics. We therefore hypothesized that human autonomy and SA performance improves through dynamic and selective copilot intervention. To address this, we develop a goal-agnostic intervention assistance (IA) that dynamically shares control by having the copilot intervene only when the expected value of the copilot’s action exceeds that of the human’s action. We implement IA with a diffusion copilot (termed IDA) trained on expert demonstrations with goal masking. We prove that IDA performance is lower bounded by human performance, so that IDA does not negatively impact human control. In experiments with simulated human pilots, we show that IDA achieves higher performance than both pilot-only and traditional SA control in variants of the Reacher environment and Lunar Lander. We then demonstrate with human-in the-loop experiments that IDA achieves better control in Lunar Lander and that human participants experience greater autonomy and prefer IDA over pilot-only and traditional SA control. We attribute the success of IDA to preserving human autonomy while simultaneously offering assistance to prevent the human from entering universally bad states."
Poster,ShareGPT4Video: Improving Video Understanding and Generation with Better Captions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97789,"Lin Chen, Xilin Wei, Jinsong Li, Xiaoyi Dong, Pan Zhang, Yuhang Zang, Zehui Chen, Haodong Duan, lin bin, Zhenyu Tang, Li Yuan, Yu Qiao, Dahua Lin, Feng Zhao, Jiaqi Wang","We present the ShareGPT4Video series, aiming to facilitate the video understanding of large video-language models (LVLMs) and the video generation of text-to-video models (T2VMs) via dense and precise captions. The series comprises: 1) ShareGPT4Video, 40K GPT4V annotated dense captions of videos with various lengths and sources, developed through carefully designed data filtering and annotating strategy. 2) ShareCaptioner-Video, an efficient and capable captioning model for arbitrary videos, with 4.8M high-quality aesthetic videos annotated by it. 3) ShareGPT4Video-8B, a simple yet superb LVLM that reached SOTA performance on three advancing video benchmarks. To achieve this, taking aside the non-scalable costly human annotators, we find using GPT4V to caption video with a naive multi-frame or frame-concatenation input strategy leads to less detailed and sometimes temporal-confused results. We argue the challenge of designing a high-quality video captioning strategy lies in three aspects: 1) Inter-frame precise temporal change understanding. 2) Intra-frame detailed content description. 3) Frame-number scalability for arbitrary-length videos. To this end, we meticulously designed a differential video captioning strategy, which is stable, scalable, and efficient for generating captions for videos with arbitrary resolution, aspect ratios, and length. Based on it, we construct ShareGPT4Video, which contains 40K high-quality videos spanning a wide range of categories, and the resulting captions encompass rich world knowledge, object attributes, camera movements, and crucially, detailed and precise temporal descriptions of events. Based on ShareGPT4Video, we further develop ShareCaptioner-Video, a superior captioner capable of efficiently generating high-quality captions for arbitrary videos. We annotated 4.8M aesthetically appealing videos by it and verified their effectiveness on a 10-second text2video generation task. For video understanding, we verified the effectiveness of ShareGPT4Video on several current LVLM architectures and presented our superb new LVLM ShareGPT4Video-8B. All the models, strategies, and annotations will be open-sourced and we hope this project can serve as a pivotal resource for advancing both the LVLMs and T2VMs community."
Poster,Sharing Key Semantics in Transformer Makes Efficient Image Restoration,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93541,"Bin Ren, Yawei Li, Jingyun Liang, Rakesh Ranjan, Mengyuan Liu, Rita Cucchiara, Luc V Gool, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Nicu Sebe","Image Restoration (IR), a classic low-level vision task, has witnessed significant advancements through deep models that effectively model global information. Notably, the emergence of Vision Transformers (ViTs) has further propelled these advancements. When computing, the self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of ViTs, tends to encompass all global cues, even those from semantically unrelated objects or regions. This inclusivity introduces computational inefficiencies, particularly noticeable with high input resolution, as it requires processing irrelevant information, thereby impeding efficiency. Additionally, for IR, it is commonly noted that small segments of a degraded image, particularly those closely aligned semantically, provide particularly relevant information to aid in the restoration process, as they contribute essential contextual cues crucial for accurate reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose boosting IR's performance by sharing the key semantics via Transformer for IR (i.e., SemanIR) in this paper. Specifically, SemanIR initially constructs a sparse yet comprehensive key-semantic dictionary within each transformer stage by establishing essential semantic connections for every degraded patch. Subsequently, this dictionary is shared across all subsequent transformer blocks within the same stage. This strategy optimizes attention calculation within each block by focusing exclusively on semantically related components stored in the key-semantic dictionary. As a result, attention calculation achieves linear computational complexity within each window. Extensive experiments across 6 IR tasks confirm the proposed SemanIR's state-of-the-art performance, quantitatively and qualitatively showcasing advancements. The visual results, code, and trained models are available at: https://github.com/Amazingren/SemanIR."
Poster,Sharpness-Aware Minimization Activates the Interactive Teaching's Understanding and Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95279,"Mingwei Xu, Xiaofeng Cao, Ivor Tsang","Teaching is a potentially effective approach for understanding interactions among multiple intelligences. Previous explorations have convincingly shown that teaching presents additional opportunities for observation and demonstration within the learning model, such as data distillation and selection. However, the underlying optimization principles and convergence of interactive teaching lack theoretical analysis, and in this regard co-teaching serves as a notable prototype. In this paper, we discuss its role as a reduction of the larger loss landscape derived from Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM). Then, we classify it as an iterative parameter estimation process using Expectation-Maximization. The convergence of this typical interactive teaching is achieved by continuously optimizing a variational lower bound on the log marginal likelihood. This lower bound represents the expected value of the log posterior distribution of the latent variables under a scaled, factorized variational distribution. To further enhance interactive teaching's performance, we incorporate SAM's strong generalization information into interactive teaching, referred as Sharpness Reduction Interactive Teaching (SRIT). This integration can be viewed as a novel sequential optimization process. Finally, we validate the performance of our approach through multiple experiments."
Poster,Sharpness-diversity tradeoff: improving flat ensembles with SharpBalance,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93160,"Haiquan Lu, Xiaotian Liu, Yefan Zhou, Qunli Li, Kurt Keutzer, Michael Mahoney, Yujun Yan, Huanrui Yang, Yaoqing Yang","Recent studies on deep ensembles have identified the sharpness of the local minima of individual learners and the diversity of the ensemble members as key factors in improving test-time performance. Building on this, our study investigates the interplay between sharpness and diversity within deep ensembles, illustrating their crucial role in robust generalization to both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We discover a trade-off between sharpness and diversity: minimizing the sharpness in the loss landscape tends to diminish the diversity of individual members within the ensemble, adversely affecting the ensemble's improvement. The trade-off is justified through our rigorous theoretical analysis and verified empirically through extensive experiments. To address the issue of reduced diversity, we introduce SharpBalance, a novel training approach that balances sharpness and diversity within ensembles. Theoretically, we show that our training strategy achieves a better sharpness-diversity trade-off. Empirically, we conducted comprehensive evaluations in various data sets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet) and showed that SharpBalance not only effectively improves the sharpness-diversity trade-off but also significantly improves ensemble performance in ID and OOD scenarios."
