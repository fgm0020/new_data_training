Poster,Understanding Information Storage and Transfer in Multi-Modal Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93402,"Samyadeep Basu, Martin Grayson, Cecily Morrison, Besmira Nushi, Soheil Feizi, Daniela Massiceti","Understanding the mechanisms of information storage and transfer in Transformer-based models is important for driving model understanding progress. Recent work has studied these mechanisms for Large Language Models (LLMs), revealing insights on how information is stored in a model's parameters and how information flows to and from these parameters in response to specific prompts. However, these studies have not yet been extended to Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Given their expanding capabilities and real-world use, we start by studying one aspect of these models -- how MLLMs process information in a factual visual question answering task. We use a constraint-based formulation which views a visual question as having a set of visual or textual constraints that the model's generated answer must satisfy to be correct (e.g. What movie directed by \emph{the director in this photo} has won a \emph{Golden Globe}?). Under this setting, we contribute i) a method that extends causal information tracing from pure language to the multi-modal setting, and ii) \emph{VQA-Constraints}, a test-bed of 9.7K visual questions annotated with constraints. We use these tools to study two open-source MLLMs, LLaVa and multi-modal Phi-2. Our key findings show that these MLLMs rely on MLP and self-attention blocks in much earlier layers for information storage, compared to LLMs whose mid-layer MLPs are more important. We also show that a consistent small subset of visual tokens output by the vision encoder are responsible for transferring information from the image to these causal blocks. We validate these mechanisms by introducing MultEdit a model-editing algorithm that can correct errors and insert new long-tailed information into MLLMs by targeting these causal blocks. We will publicly release our dataset and code."
Poster,Understanding Linear Probing then Fine-tuning Language Models from NTK Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96843,"Akiyoshi Tomihari, Issei Sato","The two-stage fine-tuning (FT) method, linear probing (LP) then fine-tuning (LP-FT), outperforms linear probing and FT alone. This holds true for both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. One key reason for its success is the preservation of pre-trained features, achieved by obtaining a near-optimal linear head during LP. However, despite the widespread use of large language models, there has been limited exploration of more complex architectures such as Transformers. In this paper, we analyze the training dynamics of LP-FT for classification tasks on the basis of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory. Our analysis decomposes the NTK matrix into two components. This decomposition highlights the importance of the linear head norm alongside the prediction accuracy at the start of the FT stage. We also observe a significant increase in the linear head norm during LP, which stems from training with the cross-entropy (CE) loss. This increase in the linear head norm effectively reduces changes in learned features. Furthermore, we find that this increased norm can adversely affect model calibration, which can be corrected using temperature scaling. Additionally, we extend our analysis with the NTK to the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method and validate its effectiveness. Our experiments using a Transformer-based model on multiple natural language processing datasets confirm our theoretical analysis. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of LP-FT for fine-tuning language models. Code is available at https://github.com/tom4649/lp-ft_ntk."
Poster,Understanding Model Selection for Learning in Strategic Environments,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95199,"Tinashe Handina, Eric Mazumdar","The deployment of ever-larger machine learning models reflects a growing consensus that the more expressive the model class one optimizes over—and the more data one has access to—the more one can improve performance. As models get deployed in a variety of real-world scenarios, they inevitably face strategic environments. In this work, we consider the natural question of how the interplay of models and strategic interactions affects the relationship between performance at equilibrium and the expressivity of model classes. We find that strategic interactions can break the conventional view—meaning that performance does not necessarily monotonically improve as model classes get larger or more expressive (even with infinite data).  We show the implications of this result in several contexts including strategic regression, strategic classification, and multi-agent reinforcement learning. In particular, we show that each of these settings admits a Braess' paradox-like phenomenon in which optimizing over less expressive model classes allows one to achieve strictly better equilibrium outcomes. Motivated by these examples, we then propose a new paradigm for model selection in games wherein an agent seeks to choose amongst different model classes to use as their action set in a game."
Poster,Understanding Multi-Granularity for Open-Vocabulary Part Segmentation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94085,"Jiho Choi, Seonho Lee, Seungho Lee, Minhyun Lee, Hyunjung Shim","Open-vocabulary part segmentation (OVPS) is an emerging research area focused on segmenting fine-grained entities using diverse and previously unseen vocabularies.Our study highlights the inherent complexities of part segmentation due to intricate boundaries and diverse granularity, reflecting the knowledge-based nature of part identification.To address these challenges, we propose PartCLIPSeg, a novel framework utilizing generalized parts and object-level contexts to mitigate the lack of generalization in fine-grained parts.PartCLIPSeg integrates competitive part relationships and attention control, alleviating ambiguous boundaries and underrepresented parts.Experimental results demonstrate that PartCLIPSeg outperforms existing state-of-the-art OVPS methods, offering refined segmentation and an advanced understanding of part relationships within images.Through extensive experiments, our model demonstrated a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art models on the Pascal-Part-116, ADE20K-Part-234, and PartImageNet datasets."
Poster,Understanding Representation of Deep Equilibrium Models from Neural Collapse Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93614,"Haixiang Sun, Ye Shi","Deep Equilibrium Model (DEQ), which serves as a typical implicit neural network, emphasizes their memory efficiency and competitive performance compared to explicit neural networks. However, there has been relatively limited theoretical analysis on the representation of DEQ. In this paper, we utilize the Neural Collapse ($\mathcal{NC}$) as a tool to systematically analyze the representation of DEQ under both balanced and imbalanced conditions. $\mathcal{NC}$ is an interesting phenomenon in the neural network training process that characterizes the geometry of class features and classifier weights. While extensively studied in traditional explicit neural networks, the $\mathcal{NC}$ phenomenon has not received substantial attention in the context of implicit neural networks. We theoretically show that $\mathcal{NC}$ exists in DEQ under balanced conditions. Moreover, in imbalanced settings, despite the presence of minority collapse, DEQ demonstrated advantages over explicit neural networks. These advantages include the convergence of extracted features to the vertices of a simplex equiangular tight frame and self-duality properties under mild conditions, highlighting DEQ's superiority in handling imbalanced datasets. Finally, we validate our theoretical analyses through experiments in both balanced and imbalanced scenarios."
Poster,Understanding Scaling Laws with Statistical and Approximation Theory for Transformer Neural Networks on Intrinsically Low-dimensional Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95466,"Alexander Havrilla, Wenjing Liao","When training deep neural networks, a model's generalization error is often observed to follow a power scaling law dependent both on the model size and the data size. Perhaps the best known example of such scaling laws are for transformer-based large language models (**LLMs**), where networks with billions of parameters are trained on trillions of tokens of text. Yet, despite sustained widespread interest, a rigorous understanding of why transformer scaling laws exist is still missing. To answer this question, we establish novel statistical estimation and mathematical approximation theories for transformers when the input data are concentrated on a low-dimensional manifold. Our theory predicts a power law between the generalization error and both the training data size and the network size for transformers, where the power depends on the intrinsic dimension $d$ of the training data. Notably, the constructed model architecture is shallow, requiring only logarithmic depth in $d$. By leveraging low-dimensional data structures under a manifold hypothesis, we are able to explain transformer scaling laws in a way which respects the data geometry.  Moreover, we test our theory with empirical observation by training LLMs on natural language datasets. We find the observed empirical scaling laws closely agree with our theoretical predictions. Taken together, these results rigorously show the intrinsic dimension of data to be a crucial quantity affecting transformer scaling laws in both theory and practice."
Poster,"Understanding the Differences in Foundation Models: Attention, State  Space Models, and Recurrent Neural Networks",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94017,"Jerome Sieber, Carmen Amo Alonso, Alexandre Didier, Melanie Zeilinger, Antonio Orvieto","Softmax attention is the principle backbone of foundation models for various artificial intelligence applications, yet its quadratic complexity in sequence length can limit its inference throughput in long-context settings. To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models."
Poster,Understanding the Expressive Power and Mechanisms of Transformer for Sequence Modeling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96906,"Mingze Wang, Weinan E","We conduct a systematic study of the approximation properties of Transformer for sequence modeling with long, sparse and complicated memory. We investigate the mechanisms through which different components of Transformer, such as the dot-product self-attention, positional encoding and feed-forward layer, affect its expressive power, and we study their combined effects through establishing explicit approximation rates.Our study reveals the roles of critical parameters in the Transformer, such as the number of layers and the number of attention heads.These theoretical insights are validated experimentally and offer natural suggestions for alternative architectures."
Poster,Understanding the Expressivity and Trainability of Fourier Neural Operator: A Mean-Field Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95243,"Takeshi Koshizuka, Masahiro Fujisawa, Yusuke Tanaka, Issei Sato","In this paper, we explores the expressivity and trainability of the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO). We establish a mean-field theory for the FNO, analyzing the behavior of the random FNO from an \emph{edge of chaos} perspective. Our investigation into the expressivity of a random FNO involves examining the ordered-chaos phase transition of the network based on the weight distribution. This phase transition demonstrates characteristics unique to the FNO, induced by mode truncation, while also showcasing similarities to those of densely connected networks. Furthermore, we identify a connection between expressivity and trainability: the ordered and chaotic phases correspond to regions of vanishing and exploding gradients, respectively. This finding provides a practical prerequisite for the stable training of the FNO. Our experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings."
Poster,Understanding the Gains from Repeated Self-Distillation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94147,"Divyansh Pareek, Simon Du, Sewoong Oh","Self-Distillation is a special type of knowledge distillation where the student model has the same architecture as the teacher model. Despite using the same architecture and the same training data, self-distillation has been empirically observed to improve performance, especially when applied repeatedly. For such a process, there is a fundamental question of interest: How much gain is possible by applying multiple steps of self-distillation? To investigate this relative gain, we propose using the simple but canonical task of linear regression. Our analysis shows that the excess risk achieved by multi-step self-distillation can significantly improve upon a single step of self-distillation, reducing the excess risk by a factor of $d$, where $d$ is the input dimension. Empirical results on regression tasks from the UCI repository show a reduction in the learnt model's risk (MSE) by up to $47$%."
