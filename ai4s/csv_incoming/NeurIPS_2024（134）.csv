Poster,Entity Alignment with Noisy Annotations from Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93478,"Shengyuan Chen, Qinggang Zhang, Junnan Dong, Wen Hua, Qing Li, Xiao Huang","Entity alignment (EA) aims to merge two knowledge graphs (KGs) by identifying equivalent entity pairs. While existing methods heavily rely on human-generated labels, it is prohibitively expensive to incorporate cross-domain experts for annotation in real-world scenarios. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents new avenues for automating EA with annotations, inspired by their comprehensive capability to process semantic information. However, it is nontrivial to directly apply LLMs for EA since the annotation space in real-world KGs is large. LLMs could also generate noisy labels that may mislead the alignment. To this end, we propose a unified framework, LLM4EA, to effectively leverage LLMs for EA. Specifically, we design a novel active learning policy to significantly reduce the annotation space by prioritizing the most valuable entities based on the entire inter-KG and intra-KG structure. Moreover, we introduce an unsupervised label refiner to continuously enhance label accuracy through in-depth probabilistic reasoning. We iteratively optimize the policy based on the feedback from a base EA model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of LLM4EA on four benchmark datasets in terms of effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency."
Poster,Entropy-regularized Diffusion Policy with Q-Ensembles for Offline Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94062,"Ruoqi Zhang, Ziwei Luo, Jens Sjölund, Thomas Schön, Per Mattsson","Diffusion policy has shown a strong ability to express complex action distributions in offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, it suffers from overestimating Q-value functions on out-of-distribution (OOD) data points due to the offline dataset limitation. To address it, this paper proposes a novel entropy-regularized diffusion policy and takes into account the confidence of the Q-value prediction with Q-ensembles. At the core of our diffusion policy is a mean-reverting stochastic differential equation (SDE) that transfers the action distribution into a standard Gaussian form and then samples actions conditioned on the environment state with a corresponding reverse-time process. We show that the entropy of such a policy is tractable and that can be used to increase the exploration of OOD samples in offline RL training. Moreover, we propose using the lower confidence bound of Q-ensembles for pessimistic Q-value function estimation. The proposed approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across a range of tasks in the D4RL benchmarks, significantly improving upon existing diffusion-based policies. The code is available at https://github.com/ruoqizzz/entropy-offlineRL."
Poster,Entropy testing and its application to testing Bayesian networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94492,"Clément L Canonne, Qiping Yang","This paper studies the problem of \emph{entropy identity testing}: given sample access to a distribution $p$ and a fully described distribution $q$ (both are discrete distributions over the support of size $k$), and the promise that either $p = q$ or $ | H(p) - H(q) | \geqslant \varepsilon$, where $H(\cdot)$ denotes the Shannon entropy, a tester needs to distinguish between the two cases with high probability. We establish a near-optimal sample complexity bound of $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{k}/\varepsilon + {1}/{\varepsilon^2}$) for this problem, and show how to apply it to the problem of identity testing for in-degree-$d$ $n$-dimensional Bayesian networks, obtaining an upper bound of $\tilde{O}( {2^{d / 2} n^{3/2}}/{\varepsilon^2} + {n^2}/{\varepsilon^4} )$. This improves on the sample complexity bound of $\tilde{O}(2^{d/2}n^2/\varepsilon^4)$ from Canonne, Diakonikolas, Kane, and Stewart (2020), which required an additional assumption on the structure of the (unknown) Bayesian network."
Poster,Entrywise error bounds for low-rank approximations of kernel matrices,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92940,Alexander Modell,"In this paper, we derive *entrywise* error bounds for low-rank approximations of kernel matrices obtained using the truncated eigen-decomposition (or singular value decomposition). While this approximation is well-known to be optimal with respect to the spectral and Frobenius norm error, little is known about the statistical behaviour of individual entries. Our error bounds fill this gap. A key technical innovation is a delocalisation result for the eigenvectors of the kernel matrix corresponding to small eigenvalues, which takes inspiration from the field of Random Matrix Theory. Finally, we validate our theory with an empirical study of a collection of synthetic and real-world datasets."
Poster,EpiCare: A Reinforcement Learning Benchmark for Dynamic Treatment Regimes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97595,"Mason Hargrave, Alex Spaeth, Logan Grosenick","Healthcare applications pose significant challenges to existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods due to implementation risks, low data availability, short treatment episodes, sparse rewards, partial observations, and heterogeneous treatment effects. Despite significant interest in using RL to generate dynamic treatment regimes for longitudinal patient care scenarios, no standardized benchmark has yet been developed.To fill this need we introduce *Episodes of Care* (*EpiCare*), a benchmark designed to mimic the challenges associated with applying RL to longitudinal healthcare settings. We leverage this benchmark to test five state-of-the-art offline RL models as well as five common off-policy evaluation (OPE) techniques.Our results suggest that while offline RL may be capable of improving upon existing standards of care given large data availability, its applicability does not appear to extend to the moderate to low data regimes typical of healthcare settings. Additionally, we demonstrate that several OPE techniques which have become standard in the the medical RL literature fail to perform adequately on our benchmark. These results suggest that the performance of RL models in dynamic treatment regimes may be difficult to meaningfully evaluate using current OPE methods, indicating that RL for this application may still be in its early stages. We hope that these results along with the benchmark itself will facilitate the comparison of existing methods and inspire further research into techniques that increase the practical applicability of medical RL."
Poster,EPIC: Effective Prompting for Imbalanced-Class Data Synthesis in Tabular Data Classification via Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94364,"Jinhee Kim, Taesung Kim, Jaegul Choo","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning capabilities across diverse applications. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of LLMs for generating realistic synthetic tabular data, identifying key prompt design elements to optimize performance. We introduce EPIC, a novel approach that leverages balanced, grouped data samples and consistent formatting with unique variable mapping to guide LLMs in generating accurate synthetic data across all classes, even for imbalanced datasets. Evaluations on real-world datasets show that EPIC achieves state-of-the-art machine learning classification performance, significantly improving generation efficiency. These findings highlight the effectiveness of EPIC for synthetic tabular data generation, particularly in addressing class imbalance."
Poster,Epipolar-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting for Generalizable Novel View Synthesis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94008,"Zhiyuan Min, Yawei Luo, Jianwen Sun, Yi Yang","Generalizable 3D Gaussian splitting (3DGS) can reconstruct new scenes from sparse-view observations in a feed-forward inference manner, eliminating the need for scene-specific retraining required in conventional 3DGS. However, existing methods rely heavily on epipolar priors, which can be unreliable in complex real-world scenes, particularly in non-overlapping and occluded regions. In this paper, we propose eFreeSplat, an efficient feed-forward 3DGS-based model for generalizable novel view synthesis that operates independently of epipolar line constraints. To enhance multiview feature extraction with 3D perception, we employ a self-supervised Vision Transformer (ViT) with cross-view completion pre-training on large-scale datasets. Additionally, we introduce an Iterative Cross-view Gaussians Alignment method to ensure consistent depth scales across different views. Our eFreeSplat represents a new paradigm for generalizable novel view synthesis. We evaluate eFreeSplat on wide-baseline novel view synthesis tasks using the RealEstate10K and ACID datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that eFreeSplat surpasses state-of-the-art baselines that rely on epipolar priors, achieving superior geometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis quality."
Poster,Episodic Future Thinking Mechanism for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93443,"Dongsu Lee, Minhae Kwon","Understanding cognitive processes in multi-agent interactions is a primary goal in cognitive science. It can guide the direction of artificial intelligence (AI) research toward social decision-making in multi-agent systems, which includes uncertainty from character heterogeneity. In this paper, we introduce *episodic future thinking (EFT) mechanism* for a reinforcement learning (RL) agent, inspired by the cognitive processes observed in animals. To enable future thinking functionality, we first develop a *multi-character policy* that captures diverse characters with an ensemble of heterogeneous policies. The *character* of an agent is defined as a different weight combination on reward components, representing distinct behavioral preferences. The future thinking agent collects observation-action trajectories of the target agents and leverages the pre-trained multi-character policy to infer their characters. Once the character is inferred, the agent predicts the upcoming actions of target agents and simulates the potential future scenario. This capability allows the agent to adaptively select the optimal action, considering the predicted future scenario in multi-agent scenarios. To evaluate the proposed mechanism, we consider the multi-agent autonomous driving scenario in which autonomous vehicles with different driving traits are on the road. Simulation results demonstrate that the EFT mechanism with accurate character inference leads to a higher reward than existing multi-agent solutions. We also confirm that the effect of reward improvement remains valid across societies with different levels of character diversity."
Poster,Equivariant Blurring Diffusion for Hierarchical Molecular Conformer Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96234,"Jiwoong Park, Yang Shen","How can diffusion models process 3D geometries in a coarse-to-fine manner, akin to our multiscale view of the world?In this paper, we address the question by focusing on a fundamental biochemical problem of generating 3D molecular conformers conditioned on molecular graphs in a multiscale manner. Our approach consists of two hierarchical stages: i) generation of coarse-grained fragment-level 3D structure from the molecular graph, and ii) generation of fine atomic details from the coarse-grained approximated structure while allowing the latter to be adjusted simultaneously.For the challenging second stage, which demands preserving coarse-grained information while ensuring SE(3) equivariance, we introduce a novel generative model termed Equivariant Blurring Diffusion (EBD), which defines a forward process that moves towards the fragment-level coarse-grained structure by blurring the fine atomic details of conformers, and a reverse process that performs the opposite operation using equivariant networks.We demonstrate the effectiveness of EBD by geometric and chemical comparison to state-of-the-art denoising diffusion models on a benchmark of drug-like molecules.Ablation studies draw insights on the design of EBD by thoroughly analyzing its architecture, which includes the design of the loss function and the data corruption process.Codes are released at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/EBD."
Poster,Equivariant Machine Learning on Graphs with Nonlinear Spectral Filters,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93041,"Ya-Wei Eileen Lin, Ronen Talmon, Ron Levie","Equivariant machine learning is an approach for designing deep learning models that respect the symmetries of the problem, with the aim of reducing model complexity and improving generalization. In this paper, we focus on an extension of shift equivariance, which is the basis of convolution networks on images, to general graphs. Unlike images, graphs do not have a natural notion of domain translation. Therefore, we consider the graph functional shifts as the symmetry group: the unitary operators that commute with the graph shift operator. Notably, such symmetries operate in the signal space rather than directly in the spatial space.We remark that each linear filter layer of a standard spectral graph neural network (GNN) commutes with graph functional shifts, but the activation function breaks this symmetry. Instead, we propose nonlinear spectral filters (NLSFs) that are fully equivariant to graph functional shifts and show that they have universal approximation properties. The proposed NLSFs are based on a new form of spectral domain that is transferable between graphs. We demonstrate the superior performance of NLSFs over existing spectral GNNs in node and graph classification benchmarks."
