Poster,Evidence of Learned Look-Ahead in a Chess-Playing Neural Network,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96336,"Erik Jenner, Shreyas Kapur, Vasil Georgiev, Cameron Allen, Scott Emmons, Stuart J Russell","Do neural networks learn to implement algorithms such as look-ahead or search ""in the wild""? Or do they rely purely on collections of simple heuristics? We present evidence of *learned look-ahead* in the policy and value network of Leela Chess Zero, the currently strongest deep neural chess engine. We find that Leela internally represents future optimal moves and that these representations are crucial for its final output in certain board states. Concretely, we exploit the fact that Leela is a transformer that treats every chessboard square like a token in language models, and give three lines of evidence: (1) activations on certain squares of future moves are unusually important causally; (2) we find attention heads that move important information ""forward and backward in time,"" e.g., from squares of future moves to squares of earlier ones; and (3) we train a simple probe that can predict the optimal move 2 turns ahead with 92% accuracy (in board states where Leela finds a single best line). These findings are clear evidence of learned look-ahead in neural networks and might be a step towards a better understanding of their capabilities."
Poster,Evidential Mixture Machines: Deciphering Multi-Label Correlations for Active Learning Sensitivity,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93715,"Dayou Yu, Minghao Li, Weishi Shi, Qi Yu","Multi-label active learning is a crucial yet challenging area in contemporary machine learning, often complicated by a large and sparse label space. This challenge is further exacerbated in active learning scenarios where labeling resources are constrained. Drawing inspiration from existing mixture of Bernoulli models, which efficiently compress the label space into a more manageable weight coefficient space by learning correlated Bernoulli components, we propose a novel model called Evidential Mixture Machines (EMM). Our model leverages mixture components derived from unsupervised learning in the label space and improves prediction accuracy by predicting weight coefficients following the evidential learning paradigm. These coefficients are aggregated as proxy pseudo counts to enhance component offset predictions. The evidential learning approach provides an uncertainty-aware connection between input features and the predicted coefficients and components. Additionally, our method combines evidential uncertainty with predicted label embedding covariances for active sample selection, creating a richer, multi-source uncertainty metric beyond traditional uncertainty scores. Experiments on synthetic datasets show the effectiveness of evidential uncertainty prediction and EMM's capability to capture label correlations through predicted components. Further testing on real-world datasets demonstrates improved performance compared to existing multi-label active learning methods."
Poster,Evidential Stochastic Differential Equations for Time-Aware Sequential Recommendation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96864,"Krishna Neupane, Ervine Zheng, Qi Yu","Sequential recommender systems are designed to capture users' evolving interests over time. Existing methods typically assume a uniform time interval among consecutive user interactions and may not capture users' continuously evolving behavior in the short and long term. In reality, the actual time intervals of user interactions vary dramatically. Consequently, as the time interval between interactions increases, so does the uncertainty in user behavior. Intuitively, it is beneficial to establish a correlation between the interaction time interval and the model uncertainty to provide effective recommendations. To this end, we formulate a novel Evidential Neural Stochastic Differential Equation (*E-NSDE*) to seamlessly integrate NSDE and evidential learning for effective time-aware sequential recommendations. The NSDE enables the model to learn users' fine-grained time-evolving behavior by capturing continuous user representation while evidential learning quantifies both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties considering interaction time interval to provide model confidence during prediction. Furthermore, we derive a mathematical relationship between the interaction time interval and model uncertainty to guide the learning process. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to the SOTA methods."
Poster,EvoCodeBench: An Evolving Code Generation Benchmark with Domain-Specific Evaluations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97531,"Jia Li, Ge Li, Xuanming Zhang, YunFei Zhao, Yihong Dong, Zhi Jin, Binhua Li, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li","How to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation remains an open question. Many benchmarks have been proposed, but they have two limitations, i.e., data leakage and lack of domain-specific evaluation.The former hurts the fairness of benchmarks, and the latter hinders practitioners from selecting superior LLMs for specific programming domains.To address these two limitations, we propose a new benchmark - EvoCodeBench, which has the following advances: (1) Evolving data. EvoCodeBench will be dynamically updated every period (e.g., 6 months) to avoid data leakage. This paper releases the first version - EvoCodeBench-2403, containing 275 samples from 25 repositories.(2) A domain taxonomy and domain labels. Based on the statistics of open-source communities, we design a programming domain taxonomy consisting of 10 popular domains. Based on the taxonomy, we annotate each sample in EvoCodeBench with a domain label. EvoCodeBench provides a broad platform for domain-specific evaluations.(3) Domain-specific evaluations. Besides the Pass@k, we compute the Domain-Specific Improvement (DSI) and define LLMs' comfort and strange domains. These evaluations help practitioners select superior LLMs in specific domains and discover the shortcomings of existing LLMs.Besides, EvoCodeBench is collected by a rigorous pipeline and aligns with real-world repositories in multiple aspects (e.g., code distributions).We evaluate 8 popular LLMs (e.g., gpt-4, DeepSeek Coder, StarCoder 2) on EvoCodeBench and summarize some insights. EvoCodeBench reveals the actual abilities of these LLMs in real-world repositories. For example, the highest Pass@1 of gpt-4 on EvoCodeBench-2403 is only 20.74%. Besides, we evaluate LLMs in different domains and discover their comfort and strange domains. For example, gpt-4 performs best in most domains but falls behind others in the Internet domain. StarCoder 2-15B unexpectedly performs well in the Database domain and even outperforms 33B LLMs. We release EvoCodeBench, all prompts, and LLMs' completions for further community analysis."
Poster,EvolveDirector: Approaching Advanced Text-to-Image Generation with Large Vision-Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96830,"Rui Zhao, Hangjie Yuan, Yujie Wei, Shiwei Zhang, Yuchao Gu, Lingmin Ran, Xiang Wang, Jay Zhangjie Wu, David Junhao Zhang, Yingya Zhang, Mike Zheng Shou","Recent advancements in generation models have showcased remarkable capabilities in generating fantastic content. However, most of them are trained on proprietary high-quality data, and some models withhold their parameters and only provide accessible application programming interfaces (APIs), limiting their benefits for downstream tasks. To explore the feasibility of training a text-to-image generation model comparable to advanced models using publicly available resources, we introduce EvolveDirector. This framework interacts with advanced models through their public APIs to obtain text-image data pairs to train a base model. Our experiments with extensive data indicate that the model trained on generated data of the advanced model can approximate its generation capability. However, it requires large-scale samples of 10 million or more. This incurs significant expenses in time, computational resources, and especially the costs associated with calling fee-based APIs. To address this problem, we leverage pre-trained large vision-language models (VLMs) to guide the evolution of the base model. VLM continuously evaluates the base model during training and dynamically updates and refines the training dataset by the discrimination, expansion, deletion, and mutation operations. Experimental results show that this paradigm significantly reduces the required data volume. Furthermore, when approaching multiple advanced models, EvolveDirector can select the best samples generated by them to learn powerful and balanced abilities. The final trained model Edgen is demonstrated to outperform these advanced models. The code and model weights are available at https://github.com/showlab/EvolveDirector."
Poster,Exact Gradients for Stochastic Spiking Neural Networks Driven by Rough Signals,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93768,"Christian Holberg, Cristopher Salvi","We introduce a mathematically rigorous framework based on rough path theory to model stochastic spiking neural networks (SSNNs) as stochastic differential equations with event discontinuities (Event SDEs) and driven by càdlàg rough paths. Our formalism is general enough to allow for potential jumps to be present both in the solution trajectories as well as in the driving noise. We then identify a set of sufficient conditions ensuring the existence of pathwise gradients of solution trajectories and event times with respect to the network's parameters and show how these gradients satisfy a recursive relation. Furthermore, we introduce a general-purpose loss function defined by means of a new class of signature kernels indexed on càdlàg rough paths and use it to train SSNNs as generative models. We provide an end-to-end autodifferentiable solver for Event SDEs  and make its implementation available as part of the $\texttt{diffrax}$ library. Our framework is, to our knowledge, the first enabling gradient-based training of SSNNs with noise affecting both the spike timing and the network's dynamics."
Poster,Exactly Minimax-Optimal Locally Differentially Private Sampling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96070,"Hyun-Young Park, Shahab Asoodeh, Si-Hyeon Lee","The sampling problem under local differential privacy has recently been studied with potential applications to generative models, but a fundamental analysis of its privacy-utility trade-off (PUT) remains incomplete. In this work, we define the fundamental PUT of private sampling in the minimax sense, using the $f$-divergence between original and sampling distributions as the utility measure. We characterize the exact PUT for both finite and continuous data spaces under some mild conditions on the data distributions, and  propose sampling mechanisms that are universally optimal for all $f$-divergences. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of our mechanisms over baselines, in terms of theoretical utilities for finite data space and of empirical utilities for continuous data space."
Poster,"Exact, Tractable Gauss-Newton Optimization in Deep Reversible Architectures Reveal Poor Generalization",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93585,"Davide Buffelli, Jamie McGowan, Wangkun Xu, Alexandru Cioba, Da-shan Shiu, Guillaume Hennequin, Alberto Bernacchia","Second-order optimization has been shown to accelerate the training of deep neural networks in many applications, often yielding faster progress per iteration on the training loss compared to first-order optimizers. However, the generalization properties of second-order methods are still being debated. Theoretical investigations have proved difficult to carry out outside the tractable settings of heavily simplified model classes - thus, the relevance of existing theories to practical deep learning applications remains unclear. Similarly, empirical studies in large-scale models and real datasets are significantly confounded by the necessity to approximate second-order updates in practice. It is often unclear whether the observed generalization behaviour arises specifically from the second-order nature of the parameter updates, or instead reflects the specific structured (e.g. Kronecker) approximations used or any damping-based interpolation towards first-order updates. Here, we show for the first time that exact Gauss-Newton (GN) updates take on a tractable form in a class of deep reversible architectures that are sufficiently expressive to be meaningfully applied to common benchmark datasets. We exploit this novel setting to study the training and generalization properties of the GN optimizer. We find that exact GN generalizes poorly. In the mini-batch training setting, this manifests as rapidly saturating progress even on the training loss, with parameter updates found to overfit each mini-batch without producing the features that would support generalization to other mini-batches. In contrast to previous work, we show that our experiments run in the feature learning regime, in which the neural tangent kernel (NTK) changes during the course of training. However, changes in the NTK are not associated with any significant change in neural representations, explaining the lack of generalization."
Poster,Excluding the Irrelevant: Focusing Reinforcement Learning through Continuous Action Masking,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93013,"Roland Stolz, Hanna Krasowski, Jakob Thumm, Michael Eichelbeck, Philipp Gassert, Matthias Althoff","Continuous action spaces in reinforcement learning (RL) are commonly defined as multidimensional intervals. While intervals usually reflect the action boundaries for tasks well, they can be challenging for learning because the typically large global action space leads to frequent exploration of irrelevant actions. Yet, little task knowledge can be sufficient to identify significantly smaller state-specific sets of relevant actions. Focusing learning on these relevant actions can significantly improve training efficiency and effectiveness. In this paper, we propose to focus learning on the set of relevant actions and introduce three continuous action masking methods for exactly mapping the action space to the state-dependent set of relevant actions. Thus, our methods ensure that only relevant actions are executed, enhancing the predictability of the RL agent and enabling its use in safety-critical applications. We further derive the implications of the proposed methods on the policy gradient. Using proximal policy optimization ( PPO), we evaluate our methods on four control tasks, where the relevant action set is computed based on the system dynamics and a relevant state set. Our experiments show that the three action masking methods achieve higher final rewards and converge faster than the baseline without action masking."
Poster,Exclusively Penalized Q-learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96808,"Junghyuk Yeom, Yonghyeon Jo, Jeongmo Kim, Sanghyeon Lee, Seungyul Han","Constraint-based offline reinforcement learning (RL) involves policy constraints or imposing penalties on the value function to mitigate overestimation errors caused by distributional shift. This paper focuses on a limitation in existing offline RL methods with penalized value function, indicating the potential for underestimation bias due to unnecessary bias introduced in the value function. To address this concern, we propose Exclusively Penalized Q-learning (EPQ), which reduces estimation bias in the value function by selectively penalizing states that are prone to inducing estimation errors. Numerical results show that our method significantly reduces underestimation bias and improves performance in various offline control tasks compared to other offline RL methods."
