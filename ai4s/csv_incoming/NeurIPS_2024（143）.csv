Poster,Extending Multi-modal Contrastive Representations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95280,"Ziang Zhang, Zehan Wang, Luping Liu, Rongjie Huang, Xize Cheng, Zhenhui Ye, wang lin, Huadai Liu, Haifeng Huang, Yang Zhao, Tao Jin, Siqi Zheng, Zhou Zhao","Multi-modal contrastive representation (MCR) of more than three modalities is critical in multi-modal learning. Although recent methods showcase impressive achievements, the high dependence on large-scale, high-quality paired data and the expensive training costs limit their further development. Inspired by recent C-MCR, this paper proposes $\textbf{Ex}$tending $\textbf{M}$ultimodal $\textbf{C}$ontrastive $\textbf{R}$epresentation (Ex-MCR), a training-efficient and paired-data-free method to build unified contrastive representation for many modalities. Since C-MCR is designed to learn a new latent space for the two non-overlapping modalities and projects them onto this space, a significant amount of information from their original spaces is lost in the projection process. To address this issue, Ex-MCR proposes to extend one modality's space into the other's, rather than mapping both modalities onto a completely new space. This method effectively preserves semantic alignment in the original space. Experimentally, we extend pre-trained audio-text and 3D-image representations to the existing vision-text space. Without using paired data, Ex-MCR achieves comparable performance to advanced methods on a series of audio-image-text and 3D-image-text tasks and achieves superior performance when used in parallel with data-driven methods. Moreover, semantic alignment also emerges between the extended modalities (e.g., audio and 3D)."
Poster,Extending Video Masked Autoencoders to 128 frames,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94502,"Nitesh Bharadwaj Gundavarapu, Luke Friedman, Raghav Goyal, Chaitra Hegde, Eirikur Agustsson, Sagar Waghmare, Mikhail Sirotenko, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Tobias Weyand, Boqing Gong, Leonid Sigal","Video understanding has witnessed significant progress with recent video foundation models demonstrating strong performance owing to self-supervised pre-training objectives;  Masked Autoencoders (MAE) being the design of choice. Nevertheless, the majority of prior works that leverage MAE pre-training have focused on relatively short video representations (16 / 32 frames in length) largely due to hardware memory and compute limitations that scale poorly with video length due to the dense memory-intensive self-attention decoding.  One natural strategy to address these challenges is to subsample tokens to reconstruct during decoding (or decoder masking). In this work, we propose an effective strategy for prioritizing tokens which allows training on longer video sequences (128 frames) and gets better performance than, more typical, random and uniform masking strategies. The core of our approach is an adaptive decoder masking strategy that prioritizes the most important tokens and uses quantized tokens as reconstruction objectives. Our adaptive strategy leverages a powerful MAGVIT-based tokenizer that jointly learns the tokens and their priority. We validate our design choices through exhaustive ablations and observe improved performance of the resulting long-video (128 frames) encoders over short-video (32 frames) counterparts. With our long-video masked autoencoder (LVMAE) strategy, we surpass state-of-the-art on Diving48 by 3.9 points and EPIC-Kitchens-100 verb classification by 2.5 points while relying on a simple core architecture and video-only pre-training (unlike some of the prior works that require millions of labeled video-text pairs or specialized encoders)."
Poster,Extensive-Form Game Solving via Blackwell Approachability on Treeplexes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96365,"Darshan Chakrabarti, Julien Grand-Clément, Christian Kroer","We introduce the first algorithmic framework for Blackwell approachability on the sequence-form polytope, the class of convex polytopes capturing the strategies of players in extensive-form games (EFGs).This leads to a new class of regret-minimization algorithms that are stepsize-invariant, in the same sense as the Regret Matching and Regret Matching$^+$ algorithms for the simplex.Our modular framework can be combined with any existing regret minimizer over cones to compute a Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum EFGs with perfect recall, through the self-play framework. Leveraging predictive online mirror descent, we introduce *Predictive Treeplex Blackwell$^+$* (PTB$^+$), and show a $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate to Nash equilibrium in self-play. We then show how to stabilize PTB$^+$ with a stepsize, resulting in an algorithm with a state-of-the-art $O(1/T)$ convergence rate. We provide an extensive set of experiments to compare our framework with several algorithmic benchmarks, including CFR$^+$ and its predictive variant, and we highlight interesting connections between practical performance and the stepsize-dependence or stepsize-invariance properties of classical algorithms."
Poster,Externally Valid Policy Evaluation from Randomized Trials Using Additional Observational Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96790,"Sofia Ek, Dave Zachariah","Randomized trials are widely considered as the gold standard for evaluating the effects of decision policies. Trial data is, however, drawn from a population which may differ from the intended target population and this raises a problem of external validity (aka. generalizability). In this paper we seek to use trial data to draw valid inferences about the outcome of a policy on the target population. Additional covariate data from the target population is used to model the sampling of individuals in the trial study. We develop a method that yields certifiably valid trial-based policy evaluations under any specified range of model miscalibrations. The method is nonparametric and the validity is assured even with finite samples. The certified policy evaluations are illustrated using both simulated and real data."
Poster,Extracting Training Data from Molecular Pre-trained Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94410,"Renhong Huang, Jiarong Xu, Zhiming Yang, Xiang Si, Xin Jiang, Hanyang Yuan, Chunping Wang, YANG YANG","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have significantly advanced the field of drug discovery, enhancing the speed and efficiency of molecular identification. However, training these GNNs demands vast amounts of molecular data, which has spurred the emergence of collaborative model-sharing initiatives. These initiatives facilitate the sharing of molecular pre-trained models among organizations without exposing proprietary training data. Despite the benefits, these molecular pre-trained models may still pose privacy risks. For example, malicious adversaries could perform data extraction attack to recover private training data, thereby threatening commercial secrets and collaborative trust. This work, for the first time, explores the risks of extracting private training molecular data from molecular pre-trained models. This task is nontrivial as the molecular pre-trained models are non-generative and exhibit a diversity of model architectures, which differs significantly from language and image models. To address these issues, we introduce a molecule generation approach and propose a novel, model-independent scoring function for selecting promising molecules. To efficiently reduce the search space of potential molecules, we further introduce a Molecule Extraction Policy Network for molecule extraction. Our experiments demonstrate that even with only query access to molecular pre-trained models, there is a considerable risk of extracting training data, challenging the assumption that model sharing alone provides adequate protection against data extraction attacks.

Poster,Ex Uno Pluria: Insights on Ensembling in Low Precision Number Systems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96135,"Giung Nam, Juho Lee","While ensembling deep neural networks has shown promise in improving generalization performance, scaling current ensemble methods for large models remains challenging. Given that recent progress in deep learning is largely driven by the scale, exemplified by the widespread adoption of large-scale neural network architectures, scalability emerges an increasingly critical issue for machine learning algorithms in the era of large-scale models. In this work, we first showcase the potential of low precision ensembling, where ensemble members are derived from a single model within low precision number systems in a training-free manner. Our empirical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed low precision ensembling method compared to existing ensemble approaches."
Poster,Eye-gaze Guided Multi-modal Alignment for Medical Representation Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96920,"Chong Ma, Hanqi Jiang, Wenting Chen, Yiwei Li, Zihao Wu, Xiaowei Yu, Zhengliang Liu, Lei Guo, Dajiang Zhu, Tuo Zhang, Dinggang Shen, Tianming Liu, Xiang Li","In the medical multi-modal frameworks, the alignment of cross-modality features presents a significant challenge. However, existing works have learned features that are implicitly aligned from the data, without considering the explicit relationships in the medical context. This data-reliance may lead to low generalization of the learned alignment relationships. In this work, we propose the Eye-gaze Guided Multi-modal Alignment (EGMA) framework to harness eye-gaze data for better alignment of medical visual and textual features. We explore the natural auxiliary role of radiologists' eye-gaze data in aligning medical images and text, and introduce a novel approach by using eye-gaze data, collected synchronously by radiologists during diagnostic evaluations. We conduct downstream tasks of image classification and image-text retrieval on four medical datasets, where EGMA achieved state-of-the-art performance and stronger generalization across different datasets. Additionally, we explore the impact of varying amounts of eye-gaze data on model performance, highlighting the feasibility and utility of integrating this auxiliary data into multi-modal alignment framework."
Poster,EyeGraph: Modularity-aware Spatio Temporal Graph Clustering for Continuous Event-based Eye Tracking,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97635,"Nuwan Bandara, Thivya Kandappu, Argha Sen, Ila Gokarn, Archan Misra","Continuous tracking of eye movement dynamics plays a significant role in developing a broad spectrum of human-centered applications, such as cognitive skills (visual attention and working memory) modeling, human-machine interaction, biometric user authentication, and foveated rendering. Recently neuromorphic cameras have garnered significant interest in the eye-tracking research community, owing to their sub-microsecond latency in capturing intensity changes resulting from eye movements. Nevertheless, the existing approaches for event-based eye tracking suffer from several limitations: dependence on RGB frames, label sparsity, and training on datasets collected in controlled lab environments that do not adequately reflect real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose a dynamic graph-based approach that uses a neuromorphic event stream captured by Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) for high-fidelity tracking of pupillary movement. More specifically, first, we present EyeGraph, a large-scale multi-modal near-eye tracking dataset collected using a wearable event camera attached to a head-mounted device from 40 participants -- the dataset was curated while mimicking in-the-wild settings, accounting for varying mobility and ambient lighting conditions. Subsequently, to address the issue of label sparsity, we adopt an unsupervised topology-aware approach as a benchmark. To be specific, (a) we first construct a dynamic graph using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), resulting in a uniform and detailed representation of eye morphology features, facilitating accurate modeling of pupil and iris. Then (b) apply a novel topologically guided modularity-aware graph clustering approach to precisely track the movement of the pupil and address the label sparsity in event-based eye tracking. We show that our unsupervised approach has comparable performance against the supervised approaches while consistently outperforming the conventional clustering approaches."
Poster,EZ-HOI: VLM Adaptation via Guided Prompt Learning for Zero-Shot HOI Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95203,"Qinqian Lei, Bo Wang, Robby Tan","Detecting Human-Object Interactions (HOI) in zero-shot settings, where models must handle unseen classes, poses significant challenges. Existing methods that rely on aligning visual encoders with large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to tap into the extensive knowledge of VLMs, require large, computationally expensive models and encounter training difficulties. Adapting VLMs with prompt learning offers an alternative to direct alignment. However, fine-tuning on task-specific datasets often leads to overfitting to seen classes and suboptimal performance on unseen classes, due to the absence of unseen class labels. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel prompt learning-based framework for Efficient Zero-Shot HOI detection (EZ-HOI). First, we introduce Large Language Model (LLM) and VLM guidance for learnable prompts, integrating detailed HOI descriptions and visual semantics to adapt VLMs to HOI tasks. However, because training datasets contain seen-class labels alone, fine-tuning VLMs on such datasets tends to optimize learnable prompts for seen classes instead of unseen ones. Therefore, we design prompt learning for unseen classes using information from related seen classes, with LLMs utilized to highlight the differences between unseen and related seen classes. Quantitative evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our EZ-HOI achieves state-of-the-art performance across various zero-shot settings with only 10.35\% to 33.95\% of the trainable parameters compared to existing methods.

Poster,"Face2QR: A Unified Framework for Aesthetic, Face-Preserving, and Scannable QR Code Generation",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93410,"Xuehao Cui, Guangyang Wu, Zhenghao Gan, Guangtao Zhai, Xiaohong Liu","Existing methods to generate aesthetic QR codes, such as image and style transfer techniques, tend to compromise either the visual appeal or the scannability of QR codes when they incorporate human face identity. Addressing these imperfections, we present Face2QR—a novel pipeline specifically designed for generating personalized QR codes that harmoniously blend aesthetics, face identity, and scannability. Our pipeline introduces three innovative components. First, the ID-refined QR integration (IDQR) seamlessly intertwines the background styling with face ID, utilizing a unified SD-based framework with control networks. Second, the ID-aware QR ReShuffle (IDRS) effectively rectifies the conflicts between face IDs and QR patterns, rearranging QR modules to maintain the integrity of facial features without compromising scannability. Lastly, the ID-preserved Scannability Enhancement (IDSE) markedly boosts scanning robustness through latent code optimization, striking a delicate balance between face ID, aesthetic quality and QR functionality. In comprehensive experiments, Face2QR demonstrates remarkable performance, outperforming existing approaches, particularly in preserving facial recognition features within custom QR code designs."
