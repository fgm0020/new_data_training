Poster,Improving the Worst-Case Bidirectional Communication Complexity for Nonconvex Distributed Optimization under Function Similarity,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94125,"Kaja Gruntkowska, Alexander Tyurin, Peter Richtarik","Effective communication between the server and workers plays a key role in distributed optimization. In this paper, we focus on optimizing communication, uncovering inefficiencies in prevalent downlink compression approaches. Considering first the pure setup where the uplink communication costs are negligible, we introduce MARINA-P, a novel method for downlink compression, employing a collection of correlated compressors. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that MARINA-P with permutation compressors can achieve a server-to-worker communication complexity improving with the number of workers, thus being provably superior to existing algorithms. We further show that MARINA-P can serve as a starting point for extensions such as methods supporting bidirectional compression: we introduce M3, a method combining MARINA-P with uplink compression and a momentum step, achieving bidirectional compression with provable improvements in total communication complexity as the number of workers increases. Theoretical findings align closely with empirical experiments, underscoring the efficiency of the proposed algorithms."
Poster,Improving Viewpoint-Independent Object-Centric Representations through Active Viewpoint Selection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95042,"Yinxuan Huang, Chengmin Gao, Bin Li, Xiangyang Xue","Given the complexities inherent in visual scenes, such as object occlusion, a comprehensive understanding often requires observation from multiple viewpoints. Existing multi-viewpoint object-centric learning methods typically employ random or sequential viewpoint selection strategies. While applicable across various scenes, these strategies may not always be ideal, as certain scenes could benefit more from specific viewpoints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel active viewpoint selection strategy. This strategy predicts images from unknown viewpoints based on information from observation images for each scene. It then compares the object-centric representations extracted from both viewpoints and selects the unknown viewpoint with the largest disparity, indicating the greatest gain in information, as the next observation viewpoint. Through experiments on various datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our active viewpoint selection strategy, significantly enhancing segmentation and reconstruction performance compared to random viewpoint selection. Moreover, our method can accurately predict images from unknown viewpoints."
Poster,Improving Visual Prompt Tuning by Gaussian Neighborhood Minimization for Long-Tailed Visual Recognition,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96426,"Mengke Li, Ye Liu, Yang Lu, Yiqun Zhang, Yiu-ming Cheung, Hui Huang","Long-tailed visual recognition has received increasing attention recently. Despite fine-tuning techniques represented by visual prompt tuning (VPT) achieving substantial performance improvement by leveraging pre-trained knowledge, models still exhibit unsatisfactory generalization performance on tail classes. To address this issue, we propose a novel optimization strategy called Gaussian neighborhood minimization prompt tuning (GNM-PT), for VPT to address the long-tail learning problem. We introduce a novel Gaussian neighborhood loss, which provides a tight upper bound on the loss function of data distribution, facilitating a flattened loss landscape correlated to improved model generalization. Specifically, GNM-PT seeks the gradient descent direction within a random parameter neighborhood, independent of input samples, during each gradient update. Ultimately, GNM-PT enhances generalization across all classes while simultaneously reducing computational overhead. The proposed GNM-PT achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracies of 90.3%, 76.5%, and 50.1% on benchmark datasets CIFAR100-LT (IR 100), iNaturalist 2018, and Places-LT, respectively.

Poster,In-and-Out: Algorithmic Diffusion for Sampling Convex Bodies,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94559,"Yunbum Kook, Santosh Vempala, Matthew Zhang","We present a new random walk for uniformly sampling high-dimensional convex bodies. It achieves state-of-the-art runtime complexity with stronger guarantees on the output than previously known, namely in Rényi divergence (which implies TV, $\mathcal{W}_2$, KL, $\chi^2$). The proof departs from known approaches for polytime algorithms for the problem - we utilize a stochastic diffusion perspective to show contraction to the target distribution with the rate of convergence determined by functional isoperimetric constants of the stationary density."
Poster,Incentivizing Quality Text Generation via Statistical Contracts,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93145,"Eden Saig, Ohad Einav, Inbal Talgam-Cohen","While the success of large language models (LLMs) increases demand for machine-generated text, current pay-per-token pricing schemes create a misalignment of incentives known in economics as moral hazard: Text-generating agents have strong incentive to cut costs by preferring a cheaper model over the cutting-edge one, and this can be done “behind the scenes” since the agent performs inference internally. In this work, we approach this issue from an economic perspective, by proposing a pay-for-performance, contract-based framework for incentivizing quality. We study a principal-agent game where the agent generates text using costly inference, and the contract determines the principal’s payment for the text according to an automated quality evaluation. Since standard contract theory is inapplicable when internal inference costs are unknown, we introduce cost-robust contracts. As our main theoretical contribution, we characterize optimal cost-robust contracts through a direct correspondence to optimal composite hypothesis tests from statistics, generalizing a result of Saig et al. (NeurIPS’23). We evaluate our framework empirically by deriving contracts for a range of objectives and LLM evaluation benchmarks, and find that cost-robust contracts sacrifice only a marginal increase in objective value compared to their cost-aware counterparts."
Poster,IncomeSCM: From tabular data set to time-series simulator and causal estimation benchmark,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97776,Fredrik Johansson,"Evaluating observational estimators of causal effects demands information that is rarely available: unconfounded interventions and outcomes from the population of interest, created either by randomization or adjustment. As a result, it is customary to fall back on simulators when creating benchmark tasks. Simulators offer great control but are often too simplistic to make challenging tasks, either because they are hand-designed and lack the nuances of real-world data, or because they are fit to observational data without structural constraints. In this work, we propose a general, repeatable strategy for turning observational data into sequential structural causal models and challenging estimation tasks by following two simple principles: 1) fitting real-world data where possible, and 2) creating complexity by composing simple, hand-designed mechanisms. We implement these ideas in a highly configurable software package and apply it to the well-known Adult income data set to construct the IncomeSCM simulator. From this, we devise multiple estimation tasks and sample data sets to compare established estimators of causal effects. The tasks present a suitable challenge, with effect estimates varying greatly in quality between methods, despite similar performance in the modeling of factual outcomes, highlighting the need for dedicated causal estimators and model selection criteria."
Poster,In-Context Learning of a Linear Transformer Block: Benefits of the MLP Component and One-Step GD Initialization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95018,"Ruiqi Zhang, Jingfeng Wu, Peter Bartlett","We study the \emph{in-context learning} (ICL) ability of a \emph{Linear Transformer Block} (LTB) that combines a linear attention component and a linear multi-layer perceptron (MLP) component. For ICL of linear regression with a Gaussian prior and a \emph{non-zero mean}, we show that LTB can achieve nearly Bayes optimal ICL risk. In contrast, using only linear attention must incur an irreducible additive  approximation error. Furthermore, we establish a correspondence between LTB and one-step gradient descent estimators with learnable initialization ($\mathsf{GD}-\beta$), in the sense that every $\mathsf{GD}-\beta$ estimator can be implemented by an LTB estimator and every optimal LTB estimator that minimizes the in-class ICL risk is effectively a $\mathsf{GD}-\beta$ estimator.Finally, we show that $\mathsf{GD}-\beta$ estimators can be efficiently optimized with gradient flow, despite a non-convex training objective.Our results reveal that LTB achieves ICL by implementing $\mathsf{GD}-\beta$, and they highlight the role of MLP layers in reducing approximation error."
Poster,In-Context Learning State Vector with Inner and Momentum Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94117,"Dongfang Li, zhenyu liu, Xinshuo Hu, Zetian Sun, Baotian Hu, Min Zhang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited an impressive ability to perform In-Context Learning (ICL) from only a few examples. Recent works have indicated that the functions learned by ICL can be represented through compressed vectors derived from the transformer. However, the working mechanisms and optimization of these vectors are yet to be thoroughly explored. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting a comprehensive analysis of these compressed vectors, drawing parallels to the parameters trained with gradient descent, and introducing the concept of state vector. Inspired by the works on model soup and momentum-based gradient descent, we propose inner and momentum optimization methods that are applied to refine the state vector progressively as test-time adaptation. Moreover, we simulate state vector aggregation in the multiple example setting, where demonstrations comprising numerous examples are usually too lengthy for regular ICL, and further propose a divide-and-conquer aggregation method to address this challenge. We conduct extensive experiments using Llama-2 and GPT-J in both zero-shot setting and few-shot setting. The experimental results show that our optimization method effectively enhances the state vector and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks."
Poster,In-Context Learning with Representations: Contextual Generalization of Trained Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93991,"Tong Yang, Yu Huang, Yingbin Liang, Yuejie Chi","In-context learning (ICL) refers to a remarkable capability of pretrained large language models, which can learn a new task given a few examples during inference. However, theoretical understanding of ICL is largely under-explored, particularly whether transformers can be trained to generalize to unseen examples in a prompt, which will require the model to acquire contextual knowledge of the prompt for generalization. This paper investigates the training dynamics of  transformers by gradient descent through the lens of non-linear regression tasks. The contextual generalization here can be attained via  learning  the template function for each task in-context, where all template functions lie in a linear space with $m$ basis functions. We analyze the training dynamics of one-layer multi-head transformers to {in-contextly} predict unlabeled inputs given partially labeled prompts, where the labels contain Gaussian noise and the number of examples in each prompt  are not sufficient to determine the template. Under mild assumptions, we show that the training loss for a one-layer multi-head transformer converges linearly to a global minimum. Moreover, the transformer effectively learns to perform ridge regression over the basis functions. To our knowledge, this study is the first provable demonstration that transformers can learn contextual (i.e., template) information to generalize to both unseen examples and tasks when prompts contain only a small number of query-answer pairs."
Poster,In-Context Learning with Transformers: Softmax Attention Adapts to Function Lipschitzness,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93809,"Liam Collins, Advait Parulekar, Aryan Mokhtari, Sujay Sanghavi, Sanjay Shakkottai","A striking property of transformers is their ability to perform in-context learning (ICL), a machine learning framework in which the learner is presented with a novel context during inference implicitly through some data, and tasked with making a prediction in that context. As such, that learner must adapt to the context without additional training. We explore the role of *softmax* attention in an ICL setting where each context encodes a regression task. We show that an attention unit learns a window that it uses to implement a nearest-neighbors predictor adapted to the landscape of the pretraining tasks. Specifically, we show that this window widens with decreasing Lipschitzness and increasing label noise in the pretraining tasks. We also show that on low-rank, linear problems, the attention unit learns to project onto the appropriate subspace before inference. Further, we show that this adaptivity relies crucially on the softmax activation and thus cannot be replicated by the linear activation often studied in prior theoretical analyses."
