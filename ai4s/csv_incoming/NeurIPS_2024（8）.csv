Poster,Achievable Fairness on Your Data With Utility Guarantees,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95868,"Muhammad Faaiz Taufiq, Jean-Francois Ton, Yang Liu","In machine learning fairness, training models that minimize disparity across different sensitive groups often leads to diminished accuracy, a phenomenon known as the fairness-accuracy trade-off. The severity of this trade-off inherently depends on dataset characteristics such as dataset imbalances or biases and therefore, using a uniform fairness requirement across diverse datasets remains questionable. To address this, we present a computationally efficient approach to approximate the fairness-accuracy trade-off curve tailored to individual datasets, backed by rigorous statistical guarantees. By utilizing the You-Only-Train-Once (YOTO) framework, our approach mitigates the computational burden of having to train multiple models when approximating the trade-off curve. Crucially, we introduce a novel methodology for quantifying uncertainty in our estimates, thereby providing practitioners with a robust framework for auditing model fairness while avoiding false conclusions due to estimation errors. Our experiments spanning tabular (e.g., Adult), image (CelebA), and language (Jigsaw) datasets underscore that our approach not only reliably quantifies the optimum achievable trade-offs across various data modalities but also helps detect suboptimality in SOTA fairness methods."
Poster,Achieving $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon)$ Sample Complexity for Constrained Markov Decision Process,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93523,"Jiashuo Jiang, Yinyu Ye","We consider the reinforcement learning problem for the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), which plays a central role in satisfying safety or resource constraints in sequential learning and decision-making. In this problem, we are given finite resources and a MDP with unknown transition probabilities. At each stage, we take an action, collecting a reward and consuming some resources, all assumed to be unknown and need to be learned over time. In this work, we take the first step towards deriving optimal problem-dependent guarantees for the CMDP problems. We derive a logarithmic regret bound, which translates into a $O(\frac{1}{\Delta\cdot\epsilon}\cdot\log^2(1/\epsilon))$ sample complexity bound, with $\Delta$ being a problem-dependent parameter, yet independent of $\epsilon$. Our sample complexity bound improves upon the state-of-art $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity for CMDP problems established in the previous literature, in terms of the dependency on $\epsilon$. To achieve this advance, we develop a new framework for analyzing CMDP problems. To be specific, our algorithm operates in the primal space and we resolve the primal LP for the CMDP problem at each period in an online manner, with \textit{adaptive} remaining resource capacities. The key elements of our algorithm are: i) a characterization of the instance hardness via LP basis, ii) an eliminating procedure that identifies one optimal basis of the primal LP, and; iii) a resolving procedure that is adaptive to the remaining resources and sticks to the characterized optimal basis."
Poster,Achieving Constant Regret in Linear Markov Decision Processes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96956,"Weitong Zhang, Zhiyuan Fan, Jiafan He, Quanquan Gu","We study the constant regret guarantees in reinforcement learning (RL). Our objective is to design an algorithm that incurs only finite regret over infinite episodes with high probability. We introduce an algorithm, Cert-LSVI-UCB, for misspecified linear Markov decision processes (MDPs) where both the transition kernel and the reward function can be approximated by some linear function up to misspecification level $\zeta$. At the core of Cert-LSVI-UCB is an innovative certified estimator, which facilitates a fine-grained concentration analysis for multi-phase value-targeted regression, enabling us to establish an instance-dependent regret bound that is constant w.r.t. the number of episodes. Specifically, we demonstrate that for a linear MDP characterized by a minimal suboptimality gap $\Delta$, Cert-LSVI-UCB has a cumulative regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^3H^5/\Delta)$ with high probability, provided that the misspecification level $\zeta$ is below $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\Delta / (\sqrt{d}H^2))$. Here $d$ is the dimension of the feature space and $H$ is the horizon. Remarkably, this regret bound is independent of the number of episodes $K$. To the best of our knowledge, Cert-LSVI-UCB is the first algorithm to achieve a constant, instance-dependent, high-probability regret bound in RL with linear function approximation without relying on prior distribution assumptions."
Poster,Achieving Domain-Independent Certified Robustness via Knowledge Continuity,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93235,"Alan Sun, Chiyu Ma, Kenneth Ge, Soroush Vosoughi","We present *knowledge continuity*, a novel definition inspired by Lipschitz continuity which aims to certify the robustness of neural networks across input domains (such as continuous and discrete domains in vision and language, respectively). Most existing approaches that seek to certify robustness, especially Lipschitz continuity, lie within the continuous domain with norm and distribution-dependent guarantees. In contrast, our proposed definition yields certification guarantees that depend only on the loss function and the intermediate learned metric spaces of the neural network. These bounds are independent of domain modality, norms, and distribution. We further demonstrate that the expressiveness of a model class is not at odds with its knowledge continuity. This implies that achieving robustness by maximizing knowledge continuity should not theoretically hinder inferential performance. Finally, to complement our theoretical results, we present several applications of knowledge continuity such as regularization, a certification algorithm, and show that knowledge continuity can be used to localize vulnerable components of a neural network."
Poster,Achieving Linear Convergence with Parameter-Free Algorithms in Decentralized Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95853,"Ilya Kuruzov, Gesualdo Scutari, Alexander Gasnikov","This paper addresses the minimization of the sum of strongly convex, smoothfunctions over a network of agents without a centralized server. Existing decentralized algorithms require knowledge of functions and network parameters, such as the Lipschitz constant of the global gradient and/or network connectivity, forhyperparameter tuning. Agents usually cannot access this information, leadingto conservative selections and slow convergence or divergence. This paper introduces a decentralized algorithm that eliminates the need for specific parametertuning. Our approach employs an operator splitting technique with a novel variablemetric, enabling a local backtracking line-search to adaptively select the stepsizewithout global information or extensive communications. This results in favorableconvergence guarantees and dependence on optimization and network parameterscompared to existing nonadaptive methods. Notably, our method is the first adaptive decentralized algorithm that achieves linear convergence for strongly convex,smooth objectives. Preliminary numerical experiments support our theoreticalfindings, demonstrating superior performance in convergence speed and scalability."
Poster,Achieving Near-Optimal Convergence for Distributed Minimax Optimization with Adaptive Stepsizes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95391,"Yan Huang, Xiang Li, Yipeng Shen, Niao He, Jinming Xu","In this paper, we show that applying adaptive methods directly to distributed minimax problems can result in non-convergence due to inconsistency in locally computed adaptive stepsizes. To address this challenge, we propose D-AdaST, a Distributed Adaptive minimax method with Stepsize Tracking. The key strategy is to employ an adaptive stepsize tracking protocol involving the transmission of two extra (scalar) variables. This protocol ensures the consistency among stepsizes of nodes, eliminating the steady-state error due to the lack of coordination of stepsizes among nodes that commonly exists in vanilla distributed adaptive methods, and thus guarantees exact convergence. For nonconvex-strongly-concave distributed minimax problems, we characterize the specific transient times that ensure time-scale separation of stepsizes and quasi-independence of networks, leading to a near-optimal convergence rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( \epsilon ^{-\left( 4+\delta \right)} \right)$ for any small $\delta > 0$, matching that of the centralized counterpart. To our best knowledge, D-AdaST is the *first* distributed adaptive method achieving near-optimal convergence without knowing any problem-dependent parameters for nonconvex minimax problems. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our theoretical results."
Poster,Achieving Optimal Clustering in Gaussian Mixture Models with Anisotropic Covariance Structures,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94130,"Xin Chen, Anderson Ye Zhang","We study clustering under anisotropic Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), where covariance matrices from different clusters are unknown and are not necessarily the identity matrix. We analyze two anisotropic scenarios: homogeneous, with identical covariance matrices, and heterogeneous, with distinct matrices per cluster. For these models, we derive minimax lower bounds that illustrate the critical influence of covariance structures on clustering accuracy. To solve the clustering problem, we consider a variant of Lloyd's algorithm, adapted to estimate and utilize covariance information iteratively. We prove that the adjusted algorithm not only achieves the minimax optimality but also converges within a logarithmic number of iterations, thus bridging the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency."
Poster,Achieving Tractable Minimax Optimal Regret in Average Reward MDPs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95107,"Victor Boone, Zihan Zhang","In recent years, significant attention has been directed towards learning average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).However, existing algorithms either suffer from sub-optimal regret guarantees or computational inefficiencies.In this paper, we present the first *tractable* algorithm  with minimax optimal regret of $\mathrm{O}\left(\sqrt{\mathrm{sp}(h^*) S A T \log(SAT)}\right)$ where $\mathrm{sp}(h^*)$ is the span of the optimal bias function $h^*$, $S\times A$  is the size of the state-action space and $T$ the number of learning steps. Remarkably, our algorithm does not require prior information on $\mathrm{sp}(h^*)$. Our algorithm relies on a novel subroutine, **P**rojected **M**itigated **E**xtended **V**alue **I**teration (`PMEVI`), to compute bias-constrained optimal policies efficiently. This subroutine can be applied to various previous algorithms to obtain improved regret bounds."
Poster,A Closer Look at AUROC and AUPRC under Class Imbalance,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95133,"Matthew McDermott, Haoran Zhang, Lasse Hansen, Giovanni Angelotti, Jack Gallifant","In machine learning (ML), a widespread claim is that the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) is a superior metric for model comparison to the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) for tasks with class imbalance. This paper refutes this notion on two fronts. First, we theoretically characterize the behavior of AUROC and AUPRC in the presence of model mistakes, establishing clearly that AUPRC is not generally superior in cases of class imbalance. We further show that AUPRC can be a harmful metric as it can unduly favor model improvements in subpopulations with more frequent positive labels, heightening algorithmic disparities. Next, we empirically support our theory using experiments on both semi-synthetic and real-world fairness datasets. Prompted by these insights, we conduct a review of over 1.5 million scientific papers to understand the origin of this invalid claim, finding that it is often made without citation, misattributed to papers that do not argue this point, and aggressively over-generalized from source arguments. Our findings represent a dual contribution: a significant technical advancement in understanding the relationship between AUROC and AUPRC and a stark warning about unchecked assumptions in the ML community."
Poster,A Closer Look at the CLS Token for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93505,"Yixiong Zou, Shuai Yi, Yuhua Li, Ruixuan Li","Vision Transformer (ViT) has shown great power in learning from large-scale datasets. However, collecting sufficient data for expert knowledge is always difficult. To handle this problem, Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) has been proposed to transfer the source-domain knowledge learned from sufficient data to target domains where only scarce data is available. In this paper, we find an intriguing phenomenon neglected by previous works for the CDFSL task based on ViT: leaving the CLS token to random initialization, instead of loading source-domain trained parameters, could consistently improve target-domain performance. We then delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. We find **the CLS token naturally absorbs domain information** due to the inherent structure of the ViT, which is represented as the low-frequency component in the Fourier frequency space of images. Based on this phenomenon and interpretation, we further propose a method for the CDFSL task to decouple the domain information in the CLS token during the source-domain training, and adapt the CLS token on the target domain for efficient few-shot learning. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks validate our rationale and state-of-the-art performance. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Zoilsen/CLS_Token_CDFSL."
