Poster,"A Single-Step, Sharpness-Aware Minimization is All You Need to Achieve Efficient and Accurate Sparse Training",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95533,"Jie Ji, Gen Li, Jingjing Fu, Fatemeh Afghah, Linke Guo, Xiaoyong Yuan, Xiaolong Ma","Sparse training stands as a landmark approach in addressing the considerable training resource demands imposed by the continuously expanding size of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, the training of a sparse DNN encounters great challenges in achieving optimal generalization ability despite the efforts from the state-of-the-art sparse training methodologies. To unravel the mysterious reason behind the difficulty of sparse training, we connect the network sparsity with neural loss functions structure, and identify the cause of such difficulty lies in chaotic loss surface. In light of such revelation, we propose $S^{2} - SAM$, characterized by a **S**ingle-step **S**harpness_**A**ware **M**inimization that is tailored for **S**parse training. For the first time, $S^{2} - SAM$ innovates the traditional SAM-style optimization by approximating sharpness perturbation through prior gradient information, incurring *zero extra cost*. Therefore,  $S^{2} - SAM$ not only exhibits the capacity to improve generalization but also aligns with the efficiency goal of sparse training. Additionally, we study the generalization result of $S^{2} - SAM$ and provide theoretical proof for convergence. Through extensive experiments, $S^{2} - SAM$ demonstrates its universally applicable plug-and-play functionality, enhancing accuracy across various sparse training methods.

Poster,"Ask, Attend, Attack: An Effective Decision-Based Black-Box Targeted Attack for Image-to-Text Models",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96292,"Qingyuan Zeng, Zhenzhong Wang, Yiu-ming Cheung, Min JIANG","While image-to-text models have demonstrated significant advancements in various vision-language tasks, they remain susceptible to adversarial attacks. Existing white-box attacks on image-to-text models require access to the architecture, gradients, and parameters of the target model, resulting in low practicality. Although the recently proposed gray-box attacks have improved practicality, they suffer from semantic loss during the training process, which limits their targeted attack performance. To advance adversarial attacks of image-to-text models, this paper focuses on a challenging scenario: decision-based black-box targeted attacks where the attackers only have access to the final output text and aim to perform targeted attacks. Specifically, we formulate the decision-based black-box targeted attack as a large-scale optimization problem. To efficiently solve the optimization problem, a three-stage process \textit{Ask, Attend, Attack}, called \textit{AAA}, is proposed to coordinate with the solver. \textit{Ask} guides attackers to create target texts that satisfy the specific semantics. \textit{Attend} identifies the crucial regions of the image for attacking, thus reducing the search space for the subsequent \textit{Attack}. \textit{Attack} uses an evolutionary algorithm to attack the crucial regions, where the attacks are semantically related to the target texts of \textit{Ask}, thus achieving targeted attacks without semantic loss. Experimental results on transformer-based and CNN+RNN-based image-to-text models confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed \textit{AAA}."
Poster,A Sober Look at the Robustness of CLIPs to Spurious Features,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93146,"Qizhou Wang, Yong Lin, Yongqiang Chen, Ludwig Schmidt, Bo Han, Tong Zhang","Large vision language models, such as CLIP, demonstrate impressive robustness to spurious features than single-modal models trained on ImageNet. However, existing test datasets are typically curated based on ImageNet-trained models, which aim to capture the spurious features inherited in ImageNet. Benchmarking CLIP models based on the ImageNet-oriented spurious features may not be sufficient to reflect the extent to which CLIP models are robust to spurious correlations within CLIP training data, e.g., LAION. To this end, we craft a new challenging dataset named CounterAnimal designed to reveal the reliance of CLIP models on realistic spurious features. Specifically, we split animal photos into groups according to the backgrounds, and then identify a pair of groups for each class where a CLIP model shows high-performance drops across the two groups. Our evaluations show that the spurious features captured by CounterAnimal are generically learned by CLIP models with different backbones and pre-train data, yet have limited influence for ImageNet models. We provide theoretical insights that the CLIP objective cannot offer additional robustness. Furthermore, we also re-evaluate strategies such as scaling up parameters and high-quality pre-trained data. We find that they still help mitigate the spurious features, providing a promising path for future developments."
Poster,Assemblage: Automatic Binary Dataset Construction for Machine Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97592,"Chang Liu, Rebecca Saul, Yihao Sun, Edward Raff, Maya Fuchs, Townsend Southard Pantano, James Holt, Kristopher Micinski","Binary code is pervasive, and binary analysis is a key task in reverse engineering, malware classification, and vulnerability discovery. Unfortunately, while there exist large corpuses of malicious binaries, obtaining high-quality corpuses of benign binaries for modern systems has proven challenging (e.g., due to licensing issues). Consequently, machine learning based pipelines for binary analysis utilize either costly commercial corpuses (e.g., VirusTotal) or open-source binaries (e.g., coreutils) available in limited quantities. To address these issues, we present Assemblage: an extensible cloud-based distributed system that crawls, configures, and builds Windows PE binaries to obtain high-quality binary corpuses suitable for training state-of-the-art models in binary analysis. We have run Assemblage on AWS over the past year, producing 890k Windows PE and 428k Linux ELF binaries across 29 configurations. Assemblage is designed to be both reproducible and extensible, enabling users to publish ""recipes"" for their datasets, and facilitating the extraction of a wide array of features. We evaluated Assemblage by using its data to train modern learning-based pipelines for compiler provenance and binary function similarity. Our results illustrate the practical need for robust corpuses of high-quality Windows PE binaries in training modern learning-based binary analyses."
Poster,Assembly Fuzzy Representation on Hypergraph for Open-Set 3D Object Retrieval,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93088,"Yang Xu, Yifan Feng, Jun Zhang, Jun-Hai Yong, Yue Gao","The lack of object-level labels presents a significant challenge for 3D object retrieval in the open-set environment. However, part-level shapes of objects often share commonalities across categories but remain underexploited in existing retrieval methods. In this paper, we introduce the Hypergraph-Based Assembly Fuzzy Representation (HARF) framework, which navigates the intricacies of open-set 3D object retrieval through a bottom-up lens of Part Assembly. To tackle the challenge of assembly isomorphism and unification, we propose the Hypergraph Isomorphism Convolution (HIConv) for smoothing and adopt the Isomorphic Assembly Embedding (IAE) module to generate assembly embeddings with geometric-semantic consistency. To address the challenge of open-set category generalization, our method employs high-order correlations and fuzzy representation to mitigate distribution skew through the Structure Fuzzy Reconstruction (SFR) module, by constructing a leveraged hypergraph based on local certainty and global uncertainty correlations. We construct three open-set retrieval datasets for 3D objects with part-level annotations: OP-SHNP, OP-INTRA, and OP-COSEG. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on these three benchmarks show our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods."
Poster,Association of Objects May Engender Stereotypes: Mitigating Association-Engendered Stereotypes in Text-to-Image Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93379,"Junlei Zhou, Jiashi Gao, Xiangyu Zhao, Xin Yao, Xuetao Wei","Text-to-Image (T2I) has witnessed significant advancements, demonstrating superior performance for various generative tasks. However, the presence of stereotypes in T2I introduces harmful biases that require urgent attention as the T2I  technology becomes more prominent.Previous work for stereotype mitigation mainly concentrated on mitigating stereotypes engendered with individual objects within images, which failed to address stereotypes engendered by the association of multiple objects, referred to as *Association-Engendered Stereotypes*. For example, mentioning  ''black people'' and ''houses''  separately in prompts may not exhibit stereotypes. Nevertheless, when these two objects are associated in prompts, the association of ''black people'' with ''poorer houses'' becomes more pronounced. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel framework, MAS, to Mitigate Association-engendered Stereotypes. This framework models the stereotype problem as a probability distribution alignment problem, aiming to align the stereotype probability distribution of the generated image with the stereotype-free distribution. The MAS framework primarily consists of the *Prompt-Image-Stereotype CLIP* (*PIS CLIP*) and *Sensitive Transformer*. The *PIS CLIP* learns the association between prompts, images, and stereotypes, which can establish the mapping of prompts to stereotypes. The *Sensitive Transformer* produces the sensitive constraints, which guide the stereotyped image distribution to align with the stereotype-free probability distribution. Moreover, recognizing that existing metrics are insufficient for accurately evaluating association-engendered stereotypes, we propose a novel metric, *Stereotype-Distribution-Total-Variation*(*SDTV*), to evaluate stereotypes in T2I. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates association-engendered stereotypes."
Poster,Association Pattern-aware Fusion for Biological Entity Relationship Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95606,"Lingxiang Jia, Yuchen Ying, Zunlei Feng, Zipeng Zhong, Shaolun Yao, Jiacong Hu, Mingjiang Duan, Xingen Wang, Jie Song, Mingli Song","Deep learning-based methods significantly advance the exploration of associations among triple-wise biological entities (e.g., drug-target protein-adverse reaction), thereby facilitating drug discovery and safeguarding human health. However, existing researches only focus on entity-centric information mapping and aggregation, neglecting the crucial role of potential association patterns among different entities. To address the above limitation, we propose a novel association pattern-aware fusion method for biological entity relationship prediction, which effectively integrates the related association pattern information into entity representation learning. Additionally, to enhance the missing information of the low-order message passing, we devise a bind-relation module that considers the strong bind of low-order entity associations. Extensive experiments conducted on three biological datasets quantitatively demonstrate that the proposed method achieves about 4%-23% hit@1 improvements compared with state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, the interpretability of association patterns is elucidated in detail, thus revealing the intrinsic biological mechanisms and promoting it to be deployed in real-world scenarios.

Poster,"Assouad, Fano, and Le Cam with Interaction: A Unifying Lower Bound Framework and Characterization for Bandit Learnability",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94066,"Fan Chen, Dylan J Foster, Yanjun Han, Jian Qian, Alexander Rakhlin, Yunbei Xu","We develop a unifying framework for information-theoretic lower bound in statistical estimation and interactive decision making. Classical lower bound techniques---such as Fano's method, Le Cam's method, and Assouad's lemma---are central to the study of minimax risk in statistical estimation, yet are insufficient to provide tight lower bounds for \emph{interactive decision making} algorithms that collect data interactively (e.g., algorithms for bandits and reinforcement learning). Recent work of Foster et al. provides minimax lower bounds for interactive decision making using seemingly different analysis techniques from the classical methods. These results---which are proven using a complexity measure known as the \emph{Decision-Estimation Coefficient} (DEC)---capture difficulties unique to interactive learning, yet do not recover the tightest known lower bounds for passive estimation. We propose a unified view of these distinct methodologies through a new lower bound approach called \emph{interactive Fano method}. As an application, we introduce a novel complexity measure, the \emph{Fractional Covering Number}, which facilitates the new lower bounds for interactive decision making that extend the DEC methodology by incorporating the complexity of estimation. Using the fractional covering number, we (i) provide a unified characterization of learnability for \emph{any} stochastic bandit problem, (ii) close the remaining gap between the upper and lower bounds in Foster et al. (up to polynomial factors) for any interactive decision making problem in which the underlying model class is convex."
Poster,A StrongREJECT for Empty Jailbreaks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97752,"Alexandra Souly, Qingyuan Lu, Dillon Bowen, Tu Trinh, Elvis Hsieh, Sana Pandey, Pieter Abbeel, Justin Svegliato, Scott Emmons, Olivia Watkins, Sam Toyer","Most jailbreak papers claim the jailbreaks they propose are highly effective, often boasting near-100% attack success rates. However, it is perhaps more common than not for jailbreak developers to substantially exaggerate the effectiveness of their jailbreaks. We suggest this problem arises because jailbreak researchers lack a standard, high-quality benchmark for evaluating jailbreak performance, leaving researchers to create their own. To create a benchmark, researchers must choose a dataset of forbidden prompts to which a victim model will respond, along with an evaluation method that scores the harmfulness of the victim model’s responses. We show that existing benchmarks suffer from significant shortcomings and introduce the StrongREJECT benchmark to address these issues. StrongREJECT's dataset contains prompts that victim models must answer with specific, harmful information, while its automated evaluator measures the extent to which a response gives useful information to forbidden prompts. In doing so, the StrongREJECT evaluator achieves state-of-the-art agreement with human judgments of jailbreak effectiveness. Notably, we find that existing evaluation methods significantly overstate jailbreak effectiveness compared to human judgments and the StrongREJECT evaluator. We describe a surprising and novel phenomenon that explains this discrepancy: jailbreaks bypassing a victim model’s safety fine-tuning tend to reduce its capabilities. Together, our findings underscore the need for researchers to use a high-quality benchmark, such as StrongREJECT, when developing new jailbreak attacks. We release the StrongREJECT code and data at https://strong-reject.readthedocs.io/."
Poster,A Structure-Aware Framework for Learning Device Placements on Computation Graphs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95628,"Shukai Duan, Heng Ping, Nikos Kanakaris, Xiongye Xiao, Panagiotis Kyriakis, Nesreen K. Ahmed, Peiyu Zhang, Guixiang Ma, Mihai Capotă, Shahin Nazarian, Theodore Willke, Paul Bogdan","Computation graphs are Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) where the nodes correspond to mathematical operations and are used widely as abstractions in optimizations of neural networks. The device placement problem aims to identify optimal allocations of those nodes to a set of (potentially heterogeneous) devices. Existing approaches rely on two types of architectures known as grouper-placer and encoder-placer, respectively. In this work, we bridge the gap between encoder-placer and grouper-placer techniques and propose a novel framework for the task of device placement, relying on smaller computation graphs extracted from the OpenVINO toolkit. The framework consists of five steps, including graph coarsening, node representation learning and policy optimization. It facilitates end-to-end training and takes into account the DAG nature of the computation graphs. We also propose a model variant, inspired by graph parsing networks and complex network analysis, enabling graph representation learning and jointed, personalized graph partitioning, using an unspecified number of groups. To train the entire framework, we use reinforcement learning using the execution time of the placement as a reward. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our approach through multiple experiments with three benchmark models, namely Inception-V3, ResNet, and BERT. The robustness of the proposed framework is also highlighted through an ablation study. The suggested placements improve the inference speed for the benchmark models by up to $58.2\%$ over CPU execution and by up to $60.24\%$ compared to other commonly used baselines."
