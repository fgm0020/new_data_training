Poster,DOPPLER: Differentially Private Optimizers with Low-pass Filter for Privacy Noise Reduction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93453,"Xinwei Zhang, Zhiqi Bu, Mingyi Hong, Meisam Razaviyayn","Privacy is a growing concern in modern deep-learning systems and applications. Differentially private (DP) training prevents the leakage of sensitive information in the collected training data from the trained machine learning models. DP optimizers, including DP stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) and its variants, privatize the training procedure by gradient clipping and *DP noise* injection. However, in practice, DP models trained using DPSGD and its variants often suffer from significant model performance degradation. Such degradation prevents the application of DP optimization in many key tasks, such as foundation model pretraining. In this paper, we provide a novel *signal processing perspective* to the design and analysis of DP optimizers. We show that a ''frequency domain'' operation called *low-pass filtering* can be used to effectively reduce the impact of DP noise.  More specifically, by defining the ''frequency domain'' for both the gradient and differential privacy (DP) noise, we have developed a new component, called DOPPLER. This component is designed for DP algorithms and works by effectively amplifying the gradient while suppressing DP noise within this frequency domain. As a result, it maintains privacy guarantees and enhances the quality of the DP-protected model. Our experiments show that the proposed DP optimizers with a low-pass filter outperform their counterparts without the filter on various models and datasets. Both theoretical and practical evidence suggest that the  DOPPLER is effective in closing the gap between DP and non-DP training."
Poster,Do's and Don'ts: Learning Desirable Skills with Instruction Videos,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96441,"HYUNSEUNG KIM, BYUNG KUN LEE, Hojoon Lee, Dongyoon Hwang, Donghu Kim, Jaegul Choo","Unsupervised skill discovery is a learning paradigm that aims to acquire diverse behaviors without explicit rewards. However, it faces challenges in learning complex behaviors and often leads to learning unsafe or undesirable behaviors. For instance, in various continuous control tasks, current unsupervised skill discovery methods succeed in learning basic locomotions like standing but struggle with learning more complex movements such as walking and running. Moreover, they may acquire unsafe behaviors like tripping and rolling or navigate to undesirable locations such as pitfalls or hazardous areas. In response, we present **DoDont** (Do’s and Dont’s), an instruction-based skill discovery algorithm composed of two stages. First, in instruction learning stage, DoDont leverages action-free instruction videos to train an instruction network to distinguish desirable transitions from undesirable ones. Then, in the skill learning stage, the instruction network adjusts the reward function of the skill discovery algorithm to weight the desired behaviors. Specifically, we integrate the instruction network into a distance-maximizing skill discovery algorithm, where the instruction network serves as the distance function. Empirically, with less than 8 instruction videos, DoDont effectively learns desirable behaviors and avoids undesirable ones across complex continuous control tasks.

Poster,Double-Ended Synthesis Planning with Goal-Constrained Bidirectional Search,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95604,"Kevin Yu, Jihye Roh, Ziang Li, Wenhao Gao, Runzhong Wang, Connor Coley","Computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) algorithms have demonstrated expert-level abilities in planning retrosynthetic routes to molecules of low to moderate complexity. However, current search methods assume the sufficiency of reaching arbitrary building blocks, failing to address the common real-world constraint where using specific molecules is desired. To this end, we present a formulation of synthesis planning with starting material constraints. Under this formulation, we propose Double-Ended Synthesis Planning ($\texttt{DESP}$), a novel CASP algorithm under a _bidirectional graph search_ scheme that interleaves expansions from the target and from the goal starting materials to ensure constraint satisfiability. The search algorithm is guided by a goal-conditioned cost network learned offline from a partially observed hypergraph of valid chemical reactions. We demonstrate the utility of $\texttt{DESP}$ in improving solve rates and reducing the number of search expansions by biasing synthesis planning towards expert goals on multiple new benchmarks. $\texttt{DESP}$ can make use of existing one-step retrosynthesis models, and we anticipate its performance to scale as these one-step model capabilities improve."
Poster,Doubly Hierarchical Geometric Representations for Strand-based Human Hairstyle Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94097,"Yunlu Chen, Francisco Vicente Carrasco, Christian Häne, Giljoo Nam, Jean-Charles Bazin, Fernando D De la Torre","We introduce a doubly hierarchical generative representation for strand-based 3D hairstyle geometry that progresses from coarse, low-pass filtered guide hair to densely populated hair strands rich in high-frequency details. We employ the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to separate low-frequency structural curves from high-frequency curliness and noise, avoiding the Gibbs' oscillation issues associated with the standard Fourier transform in open curves. Unlike the guide hair sampled from the scalp UV map grids which may lose capturing details of the hairstyle in existing methods, our method samples optimal sparse guide strands by utilising $k$-medoids clustering centres from low-pass filtered dense strands, which more accurately retain the hairstyle's inherent characteristics. The proposed variational autoencoder-based generation network, with an architecture inspired by geometric deep learning and implicit neural representations, facilitates flexible, off-the-grid guide strand modelling and enables the completion of dense strands in any quantity and density, drawing on principles from implicit neural representations. Empirical evaluations confirm the capacity of the model to generate convincing guide hair and dense strands, complete with nuanced high-frequency details."
Poster,Doubly Mild Generalization for Offline Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96454,"Yixiu Mao, Qi Wang, Yun Qu, Yuhang Jiang, Xiangyang Ji","Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from the extrapolation error and value overestimation. From a generalization perspective, this issue can be attributed to the over-generalization of value functions or policies towards out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Significant efforts have been devoted to mitigating such generalization, and recent in-sample learning approaches have further succeeded in entirely eschewing it. Nevertheless, we show that mild generalization beyond the dataset can be trusted and leveraged to improve performance under certain conditions. To appropriately exploit generalization in offline RL, we propose Doubly Mild Generalization (DMG), comprising (i) mild action generalization and (ii) mild generalization propagation. The former refers to selecting actions in a close neighborhood of the dataset to maximize the Q values. Even so, the potential erroneous generalization can still be propagated, accumulated, and exacerbated by bootstrapping. In light of this, the latter concept is introduced to mitigate the generalization propagation without impeding the propagation of RL learning signals. Theoretically, DMG guarantees better performance than the in-sample optimal policy in the oracle generalization scenario. Even under worst-case generalization, DMG can still control value overestimation at a certain level and lower bound the performance. Empirically, DMG achieves state-of-the-art performance across Gym-MuJoCo locomotion tasks and challenging AntMaze tasks. Moreover, benefiting from its flexibility in both generalization aspects, DMG enjoys a seamless transition from offline to online learning and attains strong online fine-tuning performance."
Poster,DPIC: Decoupling Prompt and Intrinsic Characteristics for LLM Generated Text Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96185,"XIAO YU, Yuang Qi, Kejiang Chen, Guoqiang Chen, Xi Yang, Pengyuan Zhu, Xiuwei Shang, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu","Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to generate texts that pose risks of misuse, such as plagiarism, planting fake reviews on e-commerce platforms, or creating inflammatory false tweets. Consequently, detecting whether a text is generated by LLMs has become increasingly important. Existing high-quality detection methods usually require access to the interior of the model to extract the intrinsic characteristics. However, since we do not have access to the interior of the black-box model, we must resort to surrogate models, which impacts detection quality. In order to achieve high-quality detection of black-box models, we would like to extract deep intrinsic characteristics of the black-box model generated texts. We view the generation process as a coupled process of prompt and intrinsic characteristics of the generative model. Based on this insight, we propose to decouple prompt and intrinsic characteristics (DPIC) for LLM-generated text detection method. Specifically, given a candidate text, DPIC employs an auxiliary LLM to reconstruct the prompt corresponding to the candidate text, then uses the prompt to regenerate text by the auxiliary LLM, which makes the candidate text and the regenerated text align with their prompts, respectively. Then, the similarity between the candidate text and the regenerated text is used as a detection feature, thus eliminating the prompt in the detection process, which allows the detector to focus on the intrinsic characteristics of the generative model. Compared to the baselines, DPIC has achieved an average improvement of 6.76\% and 2.91\% in detecting texts from different domains generated by GPT4 and Claude3, respectively."
Poster,DRACO: A Denoising-Reconstruction Autoencoder for Cryo-EM,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93299,"YingJun Shen, Haizhao Dai, Qihe Chen, Yan Zeng, Jiakai Zhang, Yuan Pei, Jingyi Yu","Foundation models in computer vision have demonstrated exceptional performance in zero-shot and few-shot tasks by extracting multi-purpose features from large-scale datasets through self-supervised pre-training methods. However, these models often overlook the severe corruption in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) images by high-level noises. We introduce DRACO, a Denoising-Reconstruction Autoencoder for CryO-EM, inspired by the Noise2Noise (N2N) approach. By processing cryo-EM movies into odd and even images and treating them as independent noisy observations, we apply a denoising-reconstruction hybrid training scheme. We mask both images to create denoising and reconstruction tasks. For DRACO's pre-training, the quality of the dataset is essential, we hence build a high-quality, diverse dataset from an uncurated public database, including over 270,000 movies or micrographs. After pre-training, DRACO naturally serves as a generalizable cryo-EM image denoiser and a foundation model for various cryo-EM downstream tasks. DRACO demonstrates the best performance in denoising, micrograph curation, and particle picking tasks compared to state-of-the-art baselines."
Poster,Drago: Primal-Dual Coupled Variance Reduction for Faster Distributionally Robust Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93250,"Ronak Mehta, Jelena Diakonikolas, Zaid Harchaoui","We consider the penalized distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problem with a closed, convex uncertainty set, a setting that encompasses learning using $f$-DRO and spectral/$L$-risk minimization. We present Drago, a stochastic primal-dual algorithm which combines cyclic and randomized components with a carefully regularized primal update to achieve dual variance reduction. Owing to its design, Drago enjoys a state-of-the-art linear convergence rate on strongly convex-strongly concave DRO problems witha fine-grained dependency on primal and dual condition numbers. The theoretical results are supported with numerical benchmarks on regression and classification tasks."
Poster,DreamCatcher: A Wearer-aware Multi-modal Sleep Event Dataset Based on Earables in Non-restrictive Environments,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97709,"Zeyu Wang, Xiyuxing Zhang, Ruotong Yu, Yuntao Wang, Kenneth Christofferson, Jingru Zhang, Alex Mariakakis, Yuanchun Shi","Poor quality sleep can be characterized by the occurrence of events ranging from body movement to breathing impairment. Widely available earbuds equipped with sensors (also known as earables) can be combined with a sleep event detection algorithm to offer a convenient alternative to laborious clinical tests for individuals suffering from sleep disorders. Although various solutions utilizing such devices have been proposed to detect sleep events, they ignore the fact that individuals often share sleeping spaces with roommates or couples. To address this issue, we introduce DreamCatcher, the first publicly available dataset for wearer-aware sleep event algorithm development on earables. DreamCatcher encompasses eight distinct sleep events, including synchronous dual-channel audio and motion data collected from 12 pairs (24 participants) totaling 210 hours (420 hour.person) with fine-grained label. We tested multiple benchmark models on three tasks related to sleep event detection, demonstrating the usability and unique challenge of DreamCatcher. We hope that the proposed DreamCatcher can inspire other researchers to further explore efficient wearer-aware human vocal activity sensing on earables. DreamCatcher is publicly available at https://github.com/thuhci/DreamCatcher."
Poster,DreamClear: High-Capacity Real-World Image Restoration with Privacy-Safe Dataset Curation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96507,"Yuang Ai, Xiaoqiang Zhou, Huaibo Huang, Xiaotian Han, Zhengyu Chen, Quanzeng You, Hongxia Yang","Image restoration (IR) in real-world scenarios presents significant challenges due to the lack of high-capacity models and comprehensive datasets.To tackle these issues, we present a dual strategy: GenIR, an innovative data curation pipeline, and DreamClear, a cutting-edge Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image restoration model.**GenIR**, our pioneering contribution, is a dual-prompt learning pipeline that overcomes the limitations of existing datasets, which typically comprise only a few thousand images and thus offer limited generalizability for larger models. GenIR streamlines the process into three stages: image-text pair construction, dual-prompt based fine-tuning, and data generation \& filtering. This approach circumvents the laborious data crawling process, ensuring copyright compliance and providing a cost-effective, privacy-safe solution for IR dataset construction. The result is a large-scale dataset of one million high-quality images.Our second contribution, **DreamClear**, is a DiT-based image restoration model. It utilizes the generative priors of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models and the robust perceptual capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve photorealistic restoration. To boost the model's adaptability to diverse real-world degradations, we introduce the Mixture of Adaptive Modulator (MoAM). It employs token-wise degradation priors to dynamically integrate various restoration experts, thereby expanding the range of degradations the model can address.Our exhaustive experiments confirm DreamClear's superior performance, underlining the efficacy of our dual strategy for real-world image restoration.
