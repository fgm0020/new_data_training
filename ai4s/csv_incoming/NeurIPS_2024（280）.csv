Poster,Nonparametric Regression for 3D Point Cloud Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/98307,"Xinyi Li, Shan Yu, Yueying Wang, Guannan Wang, Li Wang, Ming-Jun Lai","In recent years, there has been an exponentially increased amount of point clouds collected with irregular shapes in various areas. Motivated by the importance of solid modeling for point clouds, we develop a novel and efficient smoothing tool based on multivariate splines over the triangulation to extract the underlying signal and build up a 3D solid model from the point cloud. The proposed method can denoise or deblur the point cloud effectively, provide a multi-resolution reconstruction of the actual signal, and handle sparse and irregularly distributed point clouds to recover the underlying trajectory. In addition, our method provides a natural way of numerosity data reduction. We establish the theoretical guarantees of the proposed method, including the convergence rate and asymptotic normality of the estimator, and show that the convergence rate achieves optimal nonparametric convergence. We also introduce a bootstrap method to quantify the uncertainty of the estimators. Through extensive simulation studies and a real data example, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over traditional smoothing methods in terms of estimation accuracy and efficiency of data reduction."
Poster,Non-Stationary Learning of Neural Networks with Automatic Soft Parameter Reset,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94222,"Alexandre Galashov, Michalis Titsias, András György, Clare Lyle, Razvan Pascanu, Yee Whye Teh, Maneesh Sahani","Neural networks are most often trained under the assumption that data come from a stationary distribution. However, settings in which this assumption is violated are of increasing importance; examples include supervised learning with distributional shifts, reinforcement learning, continual learning and non-stationary contextual bandits. Here, we introduce a novel learning approach that automatically models and adapts to non-stationarity by linking parameters through an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with an adaptive drift parameter. The adaptive drift draws the parameters towards the distribution used at initialisation, so the approach can be understood as a form of soft parameter reset. We show empirically that our approach performs well in non-stationary supervised, and off-policy reinforcement learning settings."
Poster,Nonstationary Sparse Spectral Permanental Process,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93960,"Zicheng Sun, Yixuan Zhang, Zenan Ling, Xuhui Fan, Feng Zhou","Existing permanental processes often impose constraints on kernel types or stationarity, limiting the model's expressiveness. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach utilizing the sparse spectral representation of nonstationary kernels. This technique relaxes the constraints on kernel types and stationarity, allowing for more flexible modeling while reducing computational complexity to the linear level. Additionally, we introduce a deep kernel variant by hierarchically stacking multiple spectral feature mappings, further enhancing the model's expressiveness to capture complex patterns in data. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in scenarios with pronounced data nonstationarity. Additionally, ablation studies are conducted to provide insights into the impact of various hyperparameters on model performance."
Poster,No-Regret Bandit Exploration based on Soft Tree Ensemble Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94426,"Shogo Iwazaki, Shinya Suzumura","We propose a novel stochastic bandit algorithm that employs reward estimates using a tree ensemble model. Specifically, our focus is on a soft tree model, a variant of the conventional decision tree that has undergone both practical and theoretical scrutiny in recent years. By deriving several non-trivial properties of soft trees, we extend the existing analytical techniques used for neural bandit algorithms to our soft tree-based algorithm. We demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a smaller cumulative regret compared to the existing ReLU-based neural bandit algorithms. We also show that this advantage comes with a trade-off: the hypothesis space of the soft tree ensemble model is more constrained than that of a ReLU-based neural network."
Poster,No-Regret Learning for Fair Multi-Agent Social Welfare Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96887,"Mengxiao Zhang, Ramiro Deo-Campo Vuong, Haipeng Luo","We consider the problem of online multi-agent Nash social welfare (NSW) maximization. While previous works of Hossain et al. [2021], Jones et al. [2023] study similar problems in stochastic multi-agent multi-armed bandits and show that $\sqrt{T}$-regret is possible after $T$ rounds, their fairness measure is the product of all agents' rewards, instead of their NSW (that is, their geometric mean). Given the fundamental role of NSW in the fairness literature, it is more than natural to ask whether no-regret fair learning with NSW as the objective is possible. In this work, we provide a complete answer to this question in various settings. Specifically, in stochastic $N$-agent $K$-armed bandits, we develop an algorithm with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(K^{\frac{2}{N}}T^{\frac{N-1}{N}})$ regret and prove that the dependence on $T$ is tight, making it a sharp contrast to the $\sqrt{T}$-regret bounds of Hossain et al. [2021], Jones et al. [2023]. We then consider a more challenging version of the problem with adversarial rewards. Somewhat surprisingly, despite NSW being a concave function, we prove that no algorithm can achieve sublinear regret. To circumvent such negative results, we further consider a setting with full-information feedback and design two algorithms with $\sqrt{T}$-regret: the first one has no dependence on $N$ at all and is applicable to not just NSW but a broad class of welfare functions, while the second one has better dependence on $K$ and is preferable when $N$ is small.Finally, we also show that logarithmic regret is possible whenever there exists one agent who is indifferent about different arms."
Poster,No-regret Learning in Harmonic Games: Extrapolation in the Face of Conflicting Interests,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95828,"Davide Legacci, Panayotis Mertikopoulos, Christos Papadimitriou, Georgios Piliouras, Bary Pradelski","The long-run behavior of multi-agent online learning -- and, in particular, no-regret learning -- is relatively well-understood in potential games, where players have common interests. By contrast, in general harmonic games -- the strategic complement of potential games, where players have competing interests -- very little is known outside the narrow subclass of $2$-player zero-sum games with a fully-mixed equilibrium. Our paper seeks to partially fill this gap by focusing on the full class of (generalized) harmonic games and examining the convergence properties of ""follow-the-regularized-leader"" (FTRL), the most widely studied class of no-regret learning schemes. As a first result, we show that the continuous-time dynamics of FTRL are Poincaré recurrent, i.e., they return arbitrarily close to their starting point infinitely often, and hence fail to converge. In discrete time, the standard, ""vanilla"" implementation of FTRL may lead to even worse outcomes, eventually trapping the players in a perpetual cycle of best-responses. However, if FTRL is augmented with a suitable extrapolation step -- which includes as special cases the optimistic and mirror-prox variants of FTRL -- we show that learning converges to a Nash equilibrium from any initial condition, and all players are guaranteed at most $\mathcal{O}(1)$ regret. These results provide an in-depth understanding of no-regret learning in harmonic games, nesting prior work on $2$-player zero-sum games, and showing at a high level that potential and harmonic games are complementary not only from the strategic but also from the dynamic viewpoint."
Poster,No-Regret M${}^{\natural}$-Concave Function Maximization: Stochastic Bandit Algorithms and NP-Hardness of Adversarial Full-Information Setting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95409,"Taihei Oki, Shinsaku Sakaue","M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions, a.k.a. gross substitute valuation functions, play a fundamental role in many fields, including discrete mathematics and economics. In practice, perfect knowledge of M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions is often unavailable a priori, and we can optimize them only interactively based on some feedback. Motivated by such situations, we study online M${}^{\natural}$-concave function maximization problems, which are interactive versions of the problem studied by Murota and Shioura (1999). For the stochastic bandit setting, we present $O(T^{-1/2})$-simple regret and $O(T^{2/3})$-regret algorithms under $T$ times access to unbiased noisy value oracles of M${}^{\natural}$-concave functions.  A key to proving these results is the robustness of the greedy algorithm to local errors in M${}^{\natural}$-concave function maximization, which is one of our main technical results. While we obtain those positive results for the stochastic setting, another main result of our work is an impossibility in the adversarial setting. We prove that, even with full-information feedback, no algorithms that run in polynomial time per round can achieve $O(T^{1-c})$ regret for any constant $c > 0$ unless $\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}$.  Our proof is based on a reduction from the matroid intersection problem for three matroids, which would be a novel idea in the context of online learning."
Poster,No Regrets: Investigating and Improving Regret Approximations for Curriculum Discovery,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94019,"Alexander Rutherford, Michael Beukman, Timon Willi, Bruno Lacerda, Nick Hawes, Jakob Foerster","What data or environments to use for training to improve downstream performance is a longstanding and very topical question in reinforcement learning. In particular, Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) methods have gained recent attention as their adaptive curricula promise to enable agents to be robust to in- and out-of-distribution tasks.This work investigates how existing UED methods select training environments, focusing on task prioritisation metrics.Surprisingly, despite methods aiming to maximise regret in theory, the practical approximations do not correlate with regret but with success rate.As a result, a significant portion of an agent's experience comes from environments it has already mastered, offering little to no contribution toward enhancing its abilities. Put differently, current methods fail to predict intuitive measures of *learnability*. Specifically, they are unable to consistently identify those scenarios that the agent can sometimes solve, but not always.Based on our analysis, we develop a method that directly trains on scenarios with high learnability. This simple and intuitive approach outperforms existing UED methods in several binary-outcome environments, including the standard domain of Minigrid and a novel setting closely inspired by a real-world robotics problem. We further introduce a new adversarial evaluation procedure for directly measuring robustness, closely mirroring the conditional value at risk (CVaR).We open-source all our code and present visualisations of final policies here: https://github.com/amacrutherford/sampling-for-learnability."
Poster,"No Representation, No Trust: Connecting Representation, Collapse, and Trust Issues in PPO",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94803,"Skander Moalla, Andrea Miele, Daniil Pyatko, Razvan Pascanu, Caglar Gulcehre","Reinforcement learning (RL) is inherently rife with non-stationarity since the states and rewards the agent observes during training depend on its changing policy.Therefore, networks in deep RL must be capable of adapting to new observations and fitting new targets.However, previous works have observed that networks trained under non-stationarity exhibit an inability to continue learning, termed loss of plasticity, and eventually a collapse in performance.For off-policy deep value-based RL methods, this phenomenon has been correlated with a decrease in representation rank and the ability to fit random targets, termed capacity loss.Although this correlation has generally been attributed to neural network learning under non-stationarity, the connection to representation dynamics has not been carefully studied in on-policy policy optimization methods.In this work, we empirically study representation dynamics in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) on the Atari and MuJoCo environments, revealing that PPO agents are also affected by feature rank deterioration and capacity loss.We show that this is aggravated by stronger non-stationarity, ultimately driving the actor's performance to collapse, regardless of the performance of the critic.We ask why the trust region, specific to methods like PPO, cannot alleviate or prevent the collapse and find a connection between representation collapse and the degradation of the trust region, one exacerbating the other.Finally, we present Proximal Feature Optimization (PFO), a novel auxiliary loss that, along with other interventions, shows that regularizing the representation dynamics mitigates the performance collapse of PPO agents.Code and run histories are available at https://github.com/CLAIRE-Labo/no-representation-no-trust."
Poster,Normal-GS: 3D Gaussian Splatting with Normal-Involved Rendering,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93867,"Meng Wei, Qianyi Wu, Jianmin Zheng, Hamid Rezatofighi, Jianfei Cai","Rendering and reconstruction are long-standing topics in computer vision and graphics. Achieving both high rendering quality and accurate geometry is a challenge. Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled high-fidelity novel view synthesis at real-time speeds. However, the noisy and discrete nature of 3D Gaussian primitives hinders accurate surface estimation. Previous attempts to regularize 3D Gaussian normals often degrade rendering quality due to the fundamental disconnect between normal vectors and the rendering pipeline in 3DGS-based methods. Therefore, we introduce Normal-GS, a novel approach that integrates normal vectors into the 3DGS rendering pipeline. The core idea is to model the interaction between normals and incident lighting using the physically-based rendering equation. Our approach re-parameterizes surface colors as the product of normals and a designed Integrated Directional Illumination Vector (IDIV). To optimize memory usage and simplify optimization, we employ an anchor-based 3DGS to implicitly encode locally-shared IDIVs. Additionally, Normal-GS leverages optimized normals and Integrated Directional Encoding (IDE) to accurately model specular effects, enhancing both rendering quality and surface normal precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Normal-GS achieves near state-of-the-art visual quality while obtaining accurate surface normals and preserving real-time rendering performance."
