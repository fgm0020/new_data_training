Poster,JourneyBench: A Challenging One-Stop Vision-Language Understanding Benchmark of Generated Images,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97518,"Zhecan Wang, Junzhang Liu, Chia-Wei Tang, Hani Alomari, Anushka Sivakumar, Rui Sun, Wenhao Li, Md. Atabuzzaman, Hammad Ayyubi, Haoxuan You, Alvi Md Ishmam, Kai-Wei Chang, Shih-Fu Chang, Christopher Thomas","Existing vision-language understanding benchmarks largely consist of images of objects in their usual contexts.As a consequence, recent multimodal large language models can perform well with only a shallow visual understanding by relying on background language biases. Thus, strong performance on these benchmarks does not necessarily correlate with strong visual understanding. In this paper, we release JourneyBench, a comprehensive human-annotated benchmark of generated images designed to assess the model's fine-grained multimodal reasoning abilities across five tasks: complementary multimodal chain of thought, multi-image VQA, imaginary image captioning, VQA with hallucination triggers, and fine-grained retrieval with sample-specific distractors.Unlike existing benchmarks, JourneyBench explicitly requires fine-grained multimodal reasoning in unusual imaginary scenarios where language bias and holistic image gist are insufficient. We benchmark state-of-the-art models on JourneyBench and analyze performance along a number of fine-grained dimensions. Results across all five tasks show that JourneyBench is exceptionally challenging for even the best models, indicating that models' visual reasoning abilities are not as strong as they first appear. We discuss the implications of our findings and propose avenues for further research."
Poster,Just Add $100 More: Augmenting Pseudo-LiDAR Point Cloud for Resolving Class-imbalance Problem,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95413,"Mincheol Chang, Siyeong Lee, Jinkyu Kim, Namil Kim","Typical LiDAR-based 3D object detection models are trained with real-world data collection, which is often imbalanced over classes.To deal with it, augmentation techniques are commonly used, such as copying ground truth LiDAR points and pasting them into scenes.However, existing methods struggle with the lack of sample diversity for minority classes and the limitation of suitable placement.In this work, we introduce a novel approach that utilizes pseudo LiDAR point clouds generated from low-cost miniatures or real-world videos, which is called Pseudo Ground Truth augmentation (PGT-Aug).PGT-Aug involves three key steps: (i) volumetric 3D instance reconstruction using a 2D-to-3D view synthesis model, (ii) object-level domain alignment with LiDAR intensity simulation, and (iii) a hybrid context-aware placement method from ground and map information. We demonstrate the superiority and generality of our method through performance improvements in extensive experiments conducted on popular benchmarks, i.e., nuScenes, KITTI, and Lyft, especially for the datasets with large domain gaps captured by different LiDAR configurations.The project webpage is https://just-add-100-more.github.io."
Poster,Kaleido Diffusion: Improving Conditional Diffusion Models with Autoregressive Latent Modeling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93489,"Jiatao Gu, Ying Shen, Shuangfei Zhai, Yizhe Zhang, Navdeep Jaitly, Joshua Susskind","Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for generating high-quality images from textual descriptions. Despite their successes, these models often exhibit limited diversity in the sampled images, particularly when sampling with a high classifier-free guidance weight. To address this issue, we present Kaleido, a novel approach that enhances the diversity of samples by incorporating autoregressive latent priors. Kaleido integrates an autoregressive language model that encodes the original caption and generates latent variables, serving as abstract and intermediary representations for guiding and facilitating the image generation process.In this paper, we explore a variety of discrete latent representations, including textual descriptions, detection bounding boxes, object blobs, and visual tokens. These representations diversify and enrich the input conditions to the diffusion models, enabling more diverse outputs.Our experimental results demonstrate that Kaleido effectively broadens the diversity of the generated image samples from a given textual description while maintaining high image quality. Furthermore, we show that Kaleido adheres closely to the guidance provided by the generated latent variables, demonstrating its capability to effectively control and direct the image generation process."
Poster,Kaleidoscope: Learnable Masks for Heterogeneous Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94860,"Xinran Li, Ling Pan, Jun Zhang","In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), parameter sharing is commonly employed to enhance sample efficiency. However, the popular approach of full parameter sharing often leads to homogeneous policies among agents, potentially limiting the performance benefits that could be derived from policy diversity. To address this critical limitation, we introduce \emph{Kaleidoscope}, a novel adaptive partial parameter sharing scheme that fosters policy heterogeneity while still maintaining high sample efficiency. Specifically, Kaleidoscope maintains one set of common parameters alongside multiple sets of distinct, learnable masks for different agents, dictating the sharing of parameters. It promotes diversity among policy networks by encouraging discrepancy among these masks, without sacrificing the efficiencies of parameter sharing. This design allows Kaleidoscope to dynamically balance high sample efficiency with a broad policy representational capacity, effectively bridging the gap between full parameter sharing and non-parameter sharing across various environments. We further extend Kaleidoscope to critic ensembles in the context of actor-critic algorithms, which could help improve value estimations. Our empirical evaluations across extensive environments, including multi-agent particle environment, multi-agent MuJoCo and StarCraft multi-agent challenge v2, demonstrate the superior performance of Kaleidoscope compared with existing parameter sharing approaches, showcasing its potential for performance enhancement in MARL. The code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/LXXXXR/Kaleidoscope}."
Poster,KALM: Knowledgeable Agents by Offline Reinforcement Learning from Large Language Model Rollouts,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93321,"Jing-Cheng Pang, Si-Hang Yang, Kaiyuan Li, Jiaji Zhang, Xiong-Hui Chen, Nan Tang, Yang Yu","Reinforcement learning (RL) traditionally trains agents using interaction data, which limits their capabilities to the scope of the training data. To create more knowledgeable agents, leveraging knowledge from large language models (LLMs) has shown a promising way. Despite various attempts to combine LLMs with RL, there is commonly a semantic gap between action signals and LLM tokens, which hinders their integration. This paper introduces a novel approach, KALM (Knowledgeable Agents from Language Model Rollouts), to learn knowledgeable agents by bridging this gap. KALM extracts knowledge from LLMs in the form of imaginary rollouts, which agents can learn through offline RL. To overcome the limitation that LLMs are inherently text-based and may be incompatible with numerical environmental data, KALM fine-tunes the LLM to perform bidirectional translation between textual goals and rollouts. This process enables the LLM to understand the environment better, facilitating the generation of meaningful rollouts. Experiments on robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that KALM allows agents to rephrase complex goals and tackle novel tasks requiring new optimal behaviors. KALM achieves a 46% success rate in completing 1400 various novel goals, significantly outperforming the 26% success rate of baseline methods. Project homepage: https://kalmneurips2024.github.io."
Poster,Kangaroo: Lossless Self-Speculative Decoding for Accelerating LLMs via Double Early Exiting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93829,"Fangcheng Liu, Yehui Tang, Zhenhua Liu, Yunsheng Ni, Duyu Tang, Kai Han, Yunhe Wang","Speculative decoding has demonstrated its effectiveness in accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) while maintaining an identical sampling distribution. However, the conventional approach of training separate draft model to achieve a satisfactory token acceptance rate can be costly and impractical. In this paper, we propose a novel self-speculative decoding framework \emph{Kangaroo} with \emph{double} early exiting strategy, which leverages the shallow sub-network and the \texttt{LM Head} of the well-trained target LLM to construct a self-drafting model. Then, the self-verification stage only requires computing the remaining layers over the \emph{early-exited} hidden states in parallel. To bridge the representation gap between the sub-network and the full model, we train a lightweight and efficient adapter module on top of the sub-network. One significant challenge that comes with the proposed method is that the inference latency of the self-draft model may no longer be negligible compared to the big model. To boost the token acceptance rate while minimizing the latency of the self-drafting model, we introduce an additional \emph{early exiting} mechanism for both single-sequence and the tree decoding scenarios. Specifically, we dynamically halt the small model's subsequent prediction during the drafting phase once the confidence level for the current step falls below a certain threshold. This approach reduces unnecessary computations and improves overall efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate our effectiveness, where Kangaroo achieves walltime speedups up to 2.04$\times$, outperforming Medusa-1 with 88.7\% fewer additional parameters. The code for Kangaroo is available at https://github.com/Equationliu/Kangaroo."
Poster,Keeping LLMs Aligned After Fine-tuning: The Crucial Role of Prompt Templates,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93091,"Kaifeng Lyu, Haoyu Zhao, Xinran Gu, Dingli Yu, Anirudh Goyal, Sanjeev Arora","Public LLMs such as the Llama 2-Chat underwent alignment training and were considered safe. Recently Qi et al. (2024) reported that even benign fine-tuning on seemingly safe datasets can give rise to unsafe behaviors in the models. The current paper is about methods and best practices to mitigate such loss of alignment. We focus on the setting where a public model is fine-tuned before serving users for specific usage, where the model should improve on the downstream task while maintaining alignment. Through extensive experiments on several chat models (Meta's Llama 2-Chat, Mistral AI's Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2, and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo), this paper uncovers that the prompt templates used during fine-tuning and inference play a crucial role in preserving safety alignment, and proposes the “Pure Tuning, Safe Testing” (PTST) strategy --- fine-tune models without a safety prompt, but include it at test time. This seemingly counterintuitive strategy incorporates an intended distribution shift to encourage alignment preservation. Fine-tuning experiments on GSM8K, ChatDoctor, and OpenOrca show that PTST significantly reduces the rise of unsafe behaviors."
Poster,Kermut: Composite kernel regression for protein variant effects,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93963,"Peter Mørch Groth, Mads Kerrn, Lars Olsen, Jesper Salomon, Wouter Boomsma","Reliable prediction of protein variant effects is crucial for both protein optimization and for advancing biological understanding. For practical use in protein engineering, it is important that we can also provide reliable uncertainty estimates for our predictions, and while prediction accuracy has seen much progress in recent years, uncertainty metrics are rarely reported. We here provide a Gaussian process regression model, Kermut, with a novel composite kernel for modeling mutation similarity, which obtains state-of-the-art performance for supervised protein variant effect prediction while also offering estimates of uncertainty through its posterior. An analysis of the quality of the uncertainty estimates demonstrates that our model provides meaningful levels of overall calibration, but that instance-specific uncertainty calibration remains more challenging."
Poster,Kernel-Based Function Approximation for Average Reward Reinforcement Learning: An Optimist No-Regret Algorithm,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94866,"Sattar Vakili, Julia Olkhovskaya","Reinforcement Learning (RL) utilizing kernel ridge regression to predict the expected value function represents a powerful method with great representational capacity. This setting is a highly versatile framework amenable to analytical results. We consider kernel-based function approximation for RL in the infinite horizon average reward setting, also referred to as the undiscounted setting. We propose an *optimistic* algorithm, similar to acquisition function based algorithms in the special case of bandits. We establish novel *no-regret* performance guarantees for our algorithm, under kernel-based modelling assumptions. Additionally, we derive a novel confidence interval for the kernel-based prediction of the expected value function, applicable across various RL problems."
Poster,Kernel Language Entropy: Fine-grained Uncertainty Quantification for LLMs from Semantic Similarities,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93979,"Alexander Nikitin, Jannik Kossen, Yarin Gal, Pekka Marttinen","Uncertainty quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for applications where safety and reliability are important. In particular, uncertainty can be used to improve the trustworthiness of LLMs by detecting factually incorrect model responses, commonly called hallucinations. Critically, one should seek to capture the model's semantic uncertainty, i.e., the uncertainty over the meanings of LLM outputs, rather than uncertainty over lexical or syntactic variations that do not affect answer correctness.To address this problem, we propose Kernel Language Entropy (KLE), a novel method for uncertainty estimation in white- and black-box LLMs. KLE defines positive semidefinite unit trace kernels to encode the semantic similarities of LLM outputs and quantifies uncertainty using the von Neumann entropy. It considers pairwise semantic dependencies between answers (or semantic clusters), providing more fine-grained uncertainty estimates than previous methods based on hard clustering of answers. We theoretically prove that KLE generalizes the previous state-of-the-art method called semantic entropy and empirically demonstrate that it improves uncertainty quantification performance across multiple natural language generation datasets and LLM architectures."
