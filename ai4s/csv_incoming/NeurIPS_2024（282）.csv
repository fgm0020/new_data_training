Poster,Nuclear Fusion Diamond Polishing Dataset,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97539,"Antonios Alexos, Junze Liu, Shashank Galla, Sean Hayes, Kshitij Bhardwaj, Alexander Schwartz, Monika Biener, Pierre Baldi, Satish Bukkapatnam, Suhas Bhandarkar","In the Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) process, roughly a 2mm spherical shell made of high-density carbon is used as a target for laser beams, which compress and heat it to energy levels needed for high fusion yield in nuclear fusion. These shells are polished meticulously to meet the standards for a fusion shot. However, the polishing of these shells involves multiple stages, with each stage taking several hours. To make sure that the polishing process is advancing in the right direction, we are able to measure the shell surface roughness. This measurement, however, is very labor-intensive, time-consuming, and requires a human operator. To help improve the polishing process we have released the first dataset to the public that consists of raw vibration signals with the corresponding polishing surface roughness changes. We show that this dataset can be used with a variety of neural network based methods for prediction of the change of polishing surface roughness, hence eliminating the need for the time-consuming manual process. This is the first dataset of its kind to be released in public and its use will allow the operator to make any necessary changes to the ICF polishing process for optimal results. This dataset contains the raw vibration data of multiple polishing runs with their extracted statistical features and the corresponding surface roughness values. Additionally, to generalize the prediction models to different polishing conditions, we also apply domain adaptation techniques to improve prediction accuracy for conditions unseen by the trained model. The dataset is available in \url{https://junzeliu.github.io/Diamond-Polishing-Dataset/}."
Poster,Nuclear Norm Regularization for Deep Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94255,"Christopher Scarvelis, Justin Solomon","Penalizing the nuclear norm of a function's Jacobian encourages it to locally behave like a low-rank linear map. Such functions vary locally along only a handful of directions, making the Jacobian nuclear norm a natural regularizer for machine learning problems. However, this regularizer is intractable for high-dimensional problems, as it requires computing a large Jacobian matrix and taking its SVD. We show how to efficiently penalize the Jacobian nuclear norm using techniques tailor-made for deep learning. We prove that for functions parametrized as compositions $f = g \circ h$, one may equivalently penalize the average squared Frobenius norm of $Jg$ and $Jh$. We then propose a denoising-style approximation that avoids the Jacobian computations altogether. Our method is simple, efficient, and accurate, enabling Jacobian nuclear norm regularization to scale to high-dimensional deep learning problems. We complement our theory with an empirical study of our regularizer's performance and investigate applications to denoising and representation learning."
Poster,Numerically Stable Sparse Gaussian Processes via Minimum Separation using Cover Trees,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/98323,"Alexander Terenin, David Burt, Artem Artemev, Seth Flaxman, Mark van der Wilk, Carl Edward Rasmussen, Hong Ge","Gaussian processes are frequently deployed as part of larger machine learning and decision-making systems, for instance in geospatial modeling, Bayesian optimization, or in latent Gaussian models. Within a system, the Gaussian process model needs to perform in a stable and reliable manner to ensure it interacts correctly with other parts of the system. In this work, we study the numerical stability of scalable sparse approximations based on inducing points. To do so, we first review numerical stability, and illustrate typical situations in which Gaussian process models can be unstable. Building on stability theory originally developed in the interpolation literature, we derive sufficient and in certain cases necessary conditions on the inducing points for the computations performed to be numerically stable. For low-dimensional tasks such as geospatial modeling, we propose an automated method for computing inducing points satisfying these conditions. This is done via a modification of the cover tree data structure, which is of independent interest. We additionally propose an alternative sparse approximation for regression with a Gaussian likelihood which trades off a small amount of performance to further improve stability. We provide illustrative examples showing the relationship between stability of calculations and predictive performance of inducing point methods on spatial tasks."
Poster,NVRC: Neural Video Representation Compression,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95793,"Ho Man Kwan, Ge Gao, Fan Zhang, Andrew Gower, David Bull","Recent advances in implicit neural representation (INR)-based video coding havedemonstrated its potential to compete with both conventional and other learning-based approaches. With INR methods, a neural network is trained to overfit avideo sequence, with its parameters compressed to obtain a compact representationof the video content. However, although promising results have been achieved,the best INR-based methods are still out-performed by the latest standard codecs,such as VVC VTM, partially due to the simple model compression techniquesemployed. In this paper, rather than focusing on representation architectures, whichis a common focus in many existing works, we propose a novel INR-based videocompression framework, Neural Video Representation Compression (NVRC),targeting compression of the representation. Based on its novel quantization andentropy coding approaches, NVRC is the first framework capable of optimizing anINR-based video representation in a fully end-to-end manner for the rate-distortiontrade-off. To further minimize the additional bitrate overhead introduced by theentropy models, NVRC also compresses all the network, quantization and entropymodel parameters hierarchically. Our experiments show that NVRC outperformsmany conventional and learning-based benchmark codecs, with a 23% averagecoding gain over VVC VTM (Random Access) on the UVG dataset, measuredin PSNR. As far as we are aware, this is the first time an INR-based video codecachieving such performance."
Poster,NYU CTF Bench: A Scalable Open-Source Benchmark Dataset for Evaluating LLMs in Offensive Security,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97547,"Minghao Shao, Sofija Jancheska, Meet Udeshi, Brendan Dolan-Gavitt, haoran xi, Kimberly Milner, Boyuan Chen, Max Yin, Siddharth Garg, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Farshad Khorrami, Ramesh Karri, Muhammad Shafique","Large Language Models (LLMs) are being deployed across various domains today. However, their capacity to solve Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges in cybersecurity has not been thoroughly evaluated. To address this, we develop a novel method to assess LLMs in solving CTF challenges by creating a scalable, open-source benchmark database specifically designed for these applications. This database includes metadata for LLM testing and adaptive learning, compiling a diverse range of CTF challenges from popular competitions. Utilizing the advanced function calling capabilities of LLMs, we build a fully automated system with an enhanced workflow and support for external tool calls. Our benchmark dataset and automated framework allow us to evaluate the performance of five LLMs, encompassing both black-box and open-source models. This work lays the foundation for future research into improving the efficiency of LLMs in interactive cybersecurity tasks and automated task planning. By providing a specialized benchmark, our project offers an ideal platform for developing, testing, and refining LLM-based approaches to vulnerability detection and resolution. Evaluating LLMs on these challenges and comparing with human performance yields insights into their potential for AI-driven cybersecurity solutions to perform real-world threat management. We make our benchmark dataset open source to public https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/NYU_CTF_Bench along with our playground automated framework https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/llm_ctf_automation."
Poster,OAM-TCD: A globally diverse dataset of high-resolution tree cover maps,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97767,"Josh Veitch-Michaelis, Andrew Cottam, Daniella Schweizer, Eben Broadbent, David Dao, Ce Zhang, Angelica Almeyda Zambrano, Simeon Max","Accurately quantifying tree cover is an important metric for ecosystem monitoring and for assessing progress in restored sites. Recent works have shown that deep learning-based segmentation algorithms are capable of accurately mapping trees at country and continental scales using high-resolution aerial and satellite imagery. Mapping at high (ideally sub-meter) resolution is necessary to identify individual trees, however there are few open-access datasets containing instance level annotations and those that exist are small or not geographically diverse. We present a novel open-access dataset for individual tree crown delineation (TCD) in high-resolution aerial imagery sourced from OpenAerialMap (OAM). Our dataset, OAM-TCD, comprises 5072 2048x2048 px images at 10 cm/px resolution with associated human-labeled instance masks for over 280k individual and 56k groups of trees. By sampling imagery from around the world, we are able to better capture the diversity and morphology of trees in different terrestrial biomes and in both urban and natural environments. Using our dataset, we train reference instance and semantic segmentation models that compare favorably to existing state-of-the-art models. We assess performance through k-fold cross-validation and comparison with existing datasets; additionally we demonstrate compelling results on independent aerial imagery captured over Switzerland and compare to municipal tree inventories and LIDAR-derived canopy maps in the city of Zurich. Our dataset, models and training/benchmark code are publicly released under permissive open-source licenses: Creative Commons (majority CC BY 4.0), and Apache 2.0 respectively."
Poster,OASIS: Conditional Distribution Shaping for Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96709,"Yihang Yao, Zhepeng Cen, Wenhao Ding, Haohong Lin, Shiqi Liu, Tingnan Zhang, Wenhao Yu, DING ZHAO","Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) aims to train a policy that satisfies con- straints using a pre-collected dataset. Most current methods struggle with the mismatch between imperfect demonstrations and the desired safe and rewarding performance. In this paper, we mitigate this issue from a data-centric perspective and introduce OASIS (cOnditionAl diStributIon Shaping), a new paradigm in offline safe RL designed to overcome these critical limitations. OASIS utilizes a conditional diffusion model to synthesize offline datasets, thus shaping the data dis- tribution toward a beneficial target domain. Our approach makes compliance with safety constraints through effective data utilization and regularization techniques to benefit offline safe RL training. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks and varying datasets showcase OASIS’s superiority in benefiting offline safe RL agents to achieve high-reward behavior while satisfying the safety constraints, out- performing established baselines. Furthermore, OASIS exhibits high data efficiency and robustness, making it suitable for real-world applications, particularly in tasks where safety is imperative and high-quality demonstrations are scarce.

Poster,Object segmentation from common fate: Motion energy processing enables human-like zero-shot generalization to random dot stimuli,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95285,"Matthias Tangemann, Matthias Kümmerer, Matthias Bethge","Humans excel at detecting and segmenting moving objects according to the {\it Gestalt} principle of “common fate”. Remarkably, previous works have shown that human perception generalizes this principle in a zero-shot fashion to unseen textures or random dots. In this work, we seek to better understand the computational basis for this capability by evaluating a broad range of optical flow models and a neuroscience inspired motion energy model for zero-shot figure-ground segmentation of random dot stimuli. Specifically, we use the extensively validated motion energy model proposed by Simoncelli and Heeger in 1998 which is fitted to neural recordings in cortex area MT. We find that a cross section of 40 deep optical flow models trained on different datasets struggle to estimate motion patterns in random dot videos, resulting in poor figure-ground segmentation performance. Conversely, the neuroscience-inspired model significantly outperforms all optical flow models on this task. For a direct comparison to human perception, we conduct a psychophysical study using a shape identification task as a proxy to measure human segmentation performance. All state-of-the-art optical flow models fall short of human performance, but only the motion energy model matches human capability. This neuroscience-inspired model successfully addresses the lack of human-like zero-shot generalization to random dot stimuli in current computer vision models, and thus establishes a compelling link between the Gestalt psychology of human object perception and cortical motion processing in the brain.Code, models and datasets are available at https://github.com/mtangemann/motion_energy_segmentation"
Poster,Observational Scaling Laws and the Predictability of Langauge Model Performance,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95350,"Yangjun Ruan, Chris Maddison, Tatsunori Hashimoto","Understanding how language model performance varies with scale is critical to benchmark and algorithm development. Scaling laws are one approach to building this understanding, but the requirement of training models across many different scales has limited their use. We propose an alternative, observational approach that bypasses model training and instead builds scaling laws from ~100 publically available models. Building a single scaling law from multiple model families is challenging due to large variations in their training compute efficiencies and capabilities. However, we show that these variations are consistent with a simple, generalized scaling law where language model performance is a function of a low-dimensional capability space, and model families only vary in their efficiency in converting training compute to capabilities. Using this approach, we show the surprising predictability of complex scaling phenomena: we show that several emergent phenomena follow a smooth, sigmoidal behavior and are predictable from small models; we show that the agent performance of models such as GPT-4 can be precisely predicted from simpler non-agentic benchmarks; and we show how to predict the impact of post-training interventions like Chain-of-Thought and Self-Consistency as language model capabilities continue to improve."
Poster,OccamLLM: Fast and Exact Language Model Arithmetic in a Single Step,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93221,"Owen Dugan, Donato Jiménez-Benetó, Charlotte Loh, Zhuo Chen, Rumen Dangovski, Marin Soljacic","Despite significant advancements in text generation and reasoning, Large Language Models (LLMs) still face challenges in accurately performing complex arithmetic operations. Language model systems often enable LLMs to generate code for arithmetic operations to achieve accurate calculations. However, this approach compromises speed and security, and fine-tuning risks the language model losing prior capabilities. We propose a framework that enables exact arithmetic in *a single autoregressive step*, providing faster, more secure, and more interpretable LLM systems with arithmetic capabilities. We use the hidden states of a LLM to control a symbolic architecture that performs arithmetic. Our implementation using Llama 3 with OccamNet as a symbolic model (OccamLlama) achieves 100\% accuracy on single arithmetic operations ($+,-,\times,\div,\sin{},\cos{},\log{},\exp{},\sqrt{}$), outperforming GPT 4o with and without a code interpreter. Furthermore, OccamLlama outperforms GPT 4o with and without a code interpreter on average across a range of mathematical problem solving benchmarks, demonstrating that OccamLLMs can excel in arithmetic tasks, even surpassing much larger models.
