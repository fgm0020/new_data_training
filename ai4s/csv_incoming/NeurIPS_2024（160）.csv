Poster,Frequency-aware Generative Models for Multivariate Time Series Imputation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94982,"XINYU YANG, Yu Sun, Yuan xiaojie, Xinyang Chen","Missing data in multivariate time series are common issues that can affect the analysis and downstream applications.Although multivariate time series data generally consist of the trend, seasonal and residual terms, existing works mainly focus on optimizing the modeling for the first two items. However, we find that the residual term is more crucial for getting accurate fillings, since it is more related to the diverse changes of data and the biggest component of imputation errors.Therefore, in this study, we introduce frequency-domain information and design Frequency-aware Generative Models for Multivariate Time Series Imputation (FGTI). Specifically, FGTI employs a high-frequency filter to boost the residual term imputation, supplemented by a dominant-frequency filter for the trend and seasonal imputation. Cross-domain representation learning module then fuses frequency-domain insights with deep representations.Experiments over various datasets with real-world missing values show that FGTI achieves superiority in both data imputation and downstream applications."
Poster,Freya PAGE: First Optimal Time Complexity for Large-Scale Nonconvex Finite-Sum Optimization with Heterogeneous Asynchronous Computations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96254,"Alexander Tyurin, Kaja Gruntkowska, Peter Richtarik","In practical distributed systems, workers are typically not homogeneous, and due to differences in hardware configurations and network conditions, can have highly varying processing times. We consider smooth nonconvex finite-sum (empirical risk minimization) problems in this setup and introduce a new parallel method, Freya PAGE, designed to handle arbitrarily heterogeneous and asynchronous computations. By being robust to ""stragglers"" and adaptively ignoring slow computations, Freya PAGE offers significantly improved time complexity guarantees compared to all previous methods, including Asynchronous SGD, Rennala SGD, SPIDER, and PAGE, while requiring weaker assumptions. The algorithm relies on novel generic stochastic gradient collection strategies with theoretical guarantees that can be of interest on their own, and may be used in the design of future optimization methods. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound for smooth nonconvex finite-sum problems in the asynchronous setup, providing a fundamental time complexity limit. This lower bound is tight and demonstrates the optimality of Freya PAGE in the large-scale regime, i.e., when $\sqrt{m} \geq n,$ where $n$ is \# of workers, and $m$ is \# of data samples."
Poster,Frieren: Efficient Video-to-Audio Generation Network with Rectified Flow Matching,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93527,"Yongqi Wang, Wenxiang Guo, Rongjie Huang, Jiawei Huang, Zehan Wang, Fuming You, Ruiqi Li, Zhou Zhao","Video-to-audio (V2A) generation aims to synthesize content-matching audio from silent video, and it remains challenging to build V2A models with high generation quality, efficiency, and visual-audio temporal synchrony. We propose Frieren, a V2A model based on rectified flow matching. Frieren regresses the conditional transport vector field from noise to spectrogram latent with straight paths and conducts sampling by solving ODE, outperforming autoregressive and score-based models in terms of audio quality. By employing a non-autoregressive vector field estimator based on a feed-forward transformer and channel-level cross-modal feature fusion with strong temporal alignment, our model generates audio that is highly synchronized with the input video. Furthermore, through reflow and one-step distillation with guided vector field, our model can generate decent audio in a few, or even only one sampling step. Experiments indicate that Frieren achieves state-of-the-art performance in both generation quality and temporal alignment on VGGSound, with alignment accuracy reaching 97.22\%, and 6.2\% improvement in inception score over the strong diffusion-based baseline. Audio samples and code are available at http://frieren-v2a.github.io."
Poster,From an Image to a Scene: Learning to Imagine the World from a Million 360° Videos,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93595,"Matthew Wallingford, Anand Bhattad, Aditya Kusupati, Vivek Ramanujan, Matt Deitke, Aniruddha Kembhavi, Roozbeh Mottaghi, Wei-Chiu Ma, Ali Farhadi","Three-dimensional (3D) understanding of objects and scenes play a key role in humans' ability to interact with the world and has been an active area of research in computer vision, graphics, and robotics. Large scale synthetic and object-centric 3D datasets have shown to be effective in training models that have 3D understanding of objects. However, applying a similar approach to real-world objects and scenes is difficult due to a lack of large-scale data. Videos are a potential source for real-world 3D data, but finding diverse yet corresponding views of the same content have shown to be difficult at scale. Furthermore, standard videos come with fixed viewpoints, determined at the time of capture. This restricts the ability to access scenes from a variety of more diverse and potentially useful perspectives. We argue that large scale ODIN videos can address these limitations to provide scalable corresponding frames from diverse views.  In this paper we introduce 360-1M, a 360° video dataset consisting of 1 million videos, and a process for efficiently finding corresponding frames from diverse viewpoints at scale. We train our diffusion-based model, ODIN, on 360-1M. Empowered by the largest real-world, multi-view dataset to date, ODIN is able to freely generate novel views of real-world scenes. Unlike previous methods, ODIN can move the camera through the environment, enabling the model to infer the geometry and layout of the scene. Additionally, we show improved performance on standard novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction benchmarks."
Poster,From Biased to Unbiased Dynamics: An Infinitesimal Generator Approach,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95044,"Timothée Devergne, Vladimir Kostic, Michele Parrinello, Massimiliano Pontil","We investigate learning the eigenfunctions of evolution operators for time-reversal invariant stochastic processes, a prime example being the Langevin equation used in molecular dynamics. Many physical or chemical processes described by this equation involve transitions between metastable states separated by high potential barriers that can hardly be crossed during a simulation. To overcome this bottleneck, data are collected via biased simulations that explore the state space more rapidly. We propose a framework for learning from biased simulations rooted in the infinitesimal generator of the process {and the associated resolvent operator}. We contrast our approach to more common ones based on the transfer operator, showing that it can provably learn the spectral properties of the unbiased system from biased data.  In experiments, we highlight the advantages of our method over transfer operator approaches  and recent developments based on generator learning, demonstrating its effectiveness in estimating eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. Importantly, we show that even with datasets containing only a few relevant transitions due to sub-optimal biasing, our approachrecovers relevant information about the transition mechanism."
Poster,From Causal to Concept-Based Representation Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93459,"Goutham Rajendran, Simon Buchholz, Bryon Aragam, Bernhard Schölkopf, Pradeep Ravikumar","To build intelligent machine learning systems, modern representation learning attempts to recover latent generative factors from data, such as in causal representation learning. A key question in this growing field is to provide rigorous conditions under which latent factors can be identified and thus, potentially learned. Motivated by extensive empirical literature on linear representations and concept learning, we propose to relax causal notions with a geometric notion of concepts. We formally define a notion of concepts and show rigorously that they can be provably recovered from diverse data. Instead of imposing assumptions on the ""true"" generative latent space, we assume that concepts can be represented linearly in this latent space. The tradeoff is that instead of identifying the ""true"" generative factors, we identify a subset of desired human-interpretable concepts that are relevant for a given application. Experiments on synthetic data, multimodal CLIP models and large language models supplement our results and show the utility of our approach. In this way, we provide a foundation for moving from causal representations to interpretable, concept-based representations by bringing together ideas from these two neighboring disciplines."
Poster,From Chaos to Clarity: 3DGS in the Dark,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93825,"Zhihao Li, Yufei Wang, Alex Kot, Bihan Wen","Novel view synthesis from raw images provides superior high dynamic range (HDR) information compared to reconstructions from low dynamic range RGB images. However, the inherent noise in unprocessed raw images compromises the accuracy of 3D scene representation. Our study reveals that 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is particularly susceptible to this noise, leading to numerous elongated Gaussian shapes that overfit the noise, thereby significantly degrading reconstruction quality and reducing inference speed, especially in scenarios with limited views. To address these issues, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning framework designed to reconstruct HDR 3DGS from a limited number of noisy raw images. This framework enhances 3DGS by integrating a noise extractor and employing a noise-robust reconstruction loss that leverages a noise distribution prior. Experimental results show that our method outperforms LDR/HDR 3DGS and previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised and supervised pre-trained models in both reconstruction quality and inference speed on the RawNeRF dataset across a broad range of training views. We will release the code upon paper acceptance."
Poster,From Dictionary to Tensor: A Scalable Multi-View Subspace Clustering Framework with Triple Information Enhancement,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93579,"Zhibin Gu, Songhe Feng","While Tensor-based Multi-view Subspace Clustering (TMSC) has garnered significant attention for its capacity to effectively capture high-order correlations among multiple views, three notable limitations in current TMSC methods necessitate consideration: 1) high computational complexity and reliance on dictionary completeness resulting from using observed data as the dictionary, 2) inaccurate subspace representation stemming from the oversight of local geometric information and 3) under-penalization of noise-related singular values within tensor data caused by treating all singular values equally. To address these limitations, this paper presents a \textbf{S}calable TMSC framework with \textbf{T}riple inf\textbf{O}rmatio\textbf{N} \textbf{E}nhancement (\textbf{STONE}). Notably, an enhanced anchor dictionary learning mechanism has been utilized to recover the low-rank anchor structure, resulting in reduced computational complexity and increased resilience, especially in scenarios with inadequate dictionaries. Additionally, we introduce an anchor hypergraph Laplacian regularizer to preserve the inherent geometry of the data within the subspace representation. Simultaneously, an improved hyperbolic tangent function has been employed as a precise approximation for tensor rank, effectively capturing the significant variations in singular values. Extensive experimentation on a variety of datasets demonstrates that our approach surpasses SOTA methods in both effectiveness and efficiency."
Poster,From Instance Training to Instruction Learning: Task Adapters Generation from Instructions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96123,"Huanxuan Liao, Shizhu He, Yao Xu, Yuanzhe Zhang, Yanchao Hao, Shengping Liu, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao","Large language models (LLMs) have acquired the ability to solve general tasks by utilizing instruction finetuning (IFT). However, IFT still relies heavily on instance training of extensive task data, which greatly limits the adaptability of LLMs to real-world scenarios where labeled task instances are scarce and broader task generalization becomes paramount. Contrary to LLMs, humans acquire skills and complete tasks not merely through repeated practice but also by understanding and following instructional guidelines. This paper is dedicated to simulating human learning to address the shortcomings of instance training, focusing on instruction learning to enhance cross-task generalization. Within this context, we introduce Task Adapters Generation from Instructions (TAGI), which automatically constructs the task-specific model in a parameter generation manner based on the given task instructions without retraining for unseen tasks.  Specifically, we utilize knowledge distillation to enhance the consistency between TAGI developed through Learning with Instruction and task-specific models developed through Training with Instance, by aligning the labels, output logits, and adapter parameters between them. TAGI is endowed with cross-task generalization capabilities through a two-stage training process that includes hypernetwork pretraining and finetuning. We evaluate TAGI on the Super-Natural Instructions and P3 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that TAGI can match or even outperform traditional meta-trained models and other hypernetwork models, while significantly reducing computational requirements. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/TAGI."
Poster,From Linear to Linearizable Optimization:  A Novel Framework with Applications to Stationary and Non-stationary DR-submodular Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94350,"Mohammad Pedramfar, Vaneet Aggarwal","This paper introduces the notion of upper-linearizable/quadratizable functions, a class that extends concavity and DR-submodularity in various settings, including monotone and non-monotone cases over different types of convex sets. A general meta-algorithm is devised to convert algorithms for linear/quadratic maximization into ones that optimize upper-linearizable/quadratizable functions, offering a unified approach to tackling concave and DR-submodular optimization problems. The paper extends these results to multiple feedback settings, facilitating conversions between semi-bandit/first-order feedback and bandit/zeroth-order feedback, as well as between first/zeroth-order feedback and semi-bandit/bandit feedback. Leveraging this framework, new algorithms are derived using existing results as base algorithms for convex optimization, improving upon state-of-the-art results in various cases. Dynamic and adaptive regret guarantees are obtained for DR-submodular maximization, marking the first algorithms to achieve such guarantees in these settings. Notably, the paper achieves these advancements with fewer assumptions compared to existing state-of-the-art results, underscoring its broad applicability and theoretical contributions to non-convex optimization."
