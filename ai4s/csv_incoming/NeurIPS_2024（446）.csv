Poster,What does guidance do? A fine-grained analysis in a simple setting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96240,"Muthu Chidambaram, Khashayar Gatmiry, Sitan Chen, Holden Lee, Jianfeng Lu","The use of guidance in diffusion models was originally motivated by the premise that the guidance-modified score is that of the data distribution tilted by a conditional likelihood raised to some power. In this work we clarify this misconception by rigorously proving that guidance fails to sample from the intended tilted distribution. Our main result is to give a fine-grained characterization of the dynamics of guidance in two cases, (1) mixtures of compactly supported distributions and (2) mixtures of Gaussians, which reflect salient properties of guidance that manifest on real-world data. In both cases, we prove that as the guidance parameter increases, the guided model samples more heavily from the boundary of the support of the conditional distribution. We also prove that for any nonzero level of score estimation error, sufficiently large guidance will result in sampling away from the support, theoretically justifying the empirical finding that large guidance results in distorted generations. In addition to verifying these results empirically in synthetic settings, we also show how our theoretical insights can offer useful prescriptions for practical deployment."
Poster,What do Graph Neural Networks learn? Insights from Tropical Geometry,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95336,"Tuan Anh Pham, Vikas Garg","Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been analyzed from multiple perspectives, including the WL-hierarchy, which exposes limits on their expressivity to distinguish graphs. However, characterizing the class of functions that they learn has remained unresolved. We address this fundamental question for message passing GNNs under ReLU activations, i.e., the de-facto choice for most GNNs.We first show that such GNNs learn tropical rational signomial maps or continuous piecewise linear functions, establishing an equivalence with feedforward networks (FNNs). We then elucidate the role of the choice of aggregation and update functions, and derive the first general upper and lower bounds on the geometric complexity (i.e., the number of linear regions), establishing new results for popular architectures such as GraphSAGE and GIN. We also introduce and theoretically analyze several new architectures to illuminate the relative merits of the feedforward and the message passing layers, and the tradeoffs involving depth and number of trainable parameters.  Finally, we also characterize the decision boundary for node and graph classification tasks."
Poster,What Factors Affect Multi-Modal In-Context Learning? An In-Depth Exploration,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95185,"Libo Qin, Qiguang Chen, Hao Fei, Zhi Chen, Min Li, Wanxiang Che","Recently, rapid advancements in Multi-Modal In-Context Learning (MM-ICL) have achieved notable success, which is capable of achieving superior performance across various tasks without requiring additional parameter tuning. However, the underlying rules for the effectiveness of MM-ICL remain under-explored. To fill this gap, this work aims to investigate the research question: ""_What factors affect the performance of MM-ICL?_"" To this end, we investigate extensive experiments on the three core steps of MM-ICL including demonstration retrieval, demonstration ordering, and prompt construction using 6 vision large language models and 20 strategies. Our findings highlight (1) the necessity of a multi-modal retriever for demonstration retrieval, (2) the importance of intra-demonstration ordering over inter-demonstration ordering, and (3) the enhancement of task comprehension through introductory instructions in prompts. We hope this study can serve as a foundational guide for optimizing MM-ICL strategies in future research."
Poster,What If the Input is Expanded in OOD Detection?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94752,"Boxuan Zhang, Jianing Zhu, Zengmao Wang, Tongliang Liu, Bo Du, Bo Han","Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to identify OOD inputs from unknown classes, which is important for the reliable deployment of machine learning models in the open world. Various scoring functions are proposed to distinguish it from in-distribution (ID) data. However, existing methods generally focus on excavating the discriminative information from a single input, which implicitly limits its representation dimension. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective, i.e., employing different common corruptions on the input space, to expand that. We reveal an interesting phenomenon termed *confidence mutation*, where the confidence of OOD data can decrease significantly under the corruptions, while the ID data shows a higher confidence expectation considering the resistance of semantic features. Based on that, we formalize a new scoring method, namely, *Confidence aVerage* (CoVer), which can capture the dynamic differences by simply averaging the scores obtained from different corrupted inputs and the original ones, making the OOD and ID distributions more separable in detection tasks. Extensive experiments and analyses have been conducted to understand and verify the effectiveness of CoVer."
Poster,What Is Missing For Graph Homophily? Disentangling Graph Homophily For Graph Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95879,"Yilun Zheng, Sitao Luan, Lihui Chen","Graph homophily refers to the phenomenon that connected nodes tend to share similar characteristics. Understanding this concept and its related metrics is crucial for designing effective Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The most widely used homophily metrics, such as edge or node homophily, quantify such ""similarity"" as label consistency across the graph topology. These metrics are believed to be able to reflect the performance of GNNs, especially on node-level tasks. However, many recent studies have empirically demonstrated that the performance of GNNs does not always align with homophily metrics, and how homophily influences GNNs still remains unclear and controversial. Then, a crucial question arises: What is missing in our current understanding of homophily? To figure out the missing part, in this paper, we disentangle the graph homophily into three aspects: label, structural, and feature homophily, which are derived from the three basic elements of graph data. We argue that the synergy of the three homophily can provide a more comprehensive understanding of GNN performance. Our new proposed structural and feature homophily consider the neighborhood consistency and feature dependencies among nodes, addressing the previously overlooked structural and feature aspects in graph homophily. To investigate their synergy, we propose a Contextual Stochastic Block Model with three types of Homophily (CSBM-3H), where the topology and feature generation are controlled by the three metrics. Based on the theoretical analysis of CSBM-3H, we derive a new composite metric, named Tri-Hom, that considers all three aspects and overcomes the limitations of conventional homophily metrics. The theoretical conclusions and the effectiveness of Tri-Hom have been verified through synthetic experiments on CSBM-3H. In addition, we conduct experiments on $31$ real-world benchmark datasets and calculate the correlations between homophily metrics and model performance. Tri-Hom has significantly higher correlation values than $17$ existing metrics that only focus on a single homophily aspect, demonstrating its superiority and the importance of homophily synergy.

Poster,What is my quantum computer good for? Quantum capability learning with physics-aware neural networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96649,"Daniel Hothem, Ashe Miller, Timothy Proctor","Quantum computers have the potential to revolutionize diverse fields, including quantum chemistry, materials science, and machine learning. However, contemporary quantum computers experience errors that often cause quantum programs run on them to fail. Until quantum computers can reliably execute large quantum programs, stakeholders will need fast and reliable methods for assessing a quantum computer’s capability—i.e., the programs it can run and how well it can run them. Previously, off-the-shelf neural network architectures have been used to model quantum computers' capabilities, but with limited success, because these networks fail to learn the complex quantum physics that determines real quantum computers' errors. We address this shortcoming with a new quantum-physics-aware neural network architecture for learning capability models. Our scalable architecture combines aspects of graph neural networks with efficient approximations to the physics of errors in quantum programs. This approach achieves up to $\sim50\%$ reductions in mean absolute error on both experimental and simulated data, over state-of-the-art models based on convolutional neural networks, and scales to devices with 100+ qubits."
Poster,What Makes and Breaks Safety Fine-tuning? A Mechanistic Study,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95726,"Samyak Jain, Ekdeep S Lubana, Kemal Oksuz, Tom Joy, Philip Torr, Amartya Sanyal, Puneet Dokania","Safety fine-tuning helps align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences for their safe deployment. To better understand the underlying factors that make models safe via safety fine-tuning, we design a synthetic data generation framework that captures salient aspects of an unsafe input by modeling the interaction between the task the model is asked to perform (e.g., “design”) versus the specific concepts the task is asked to be performed upon (e.g., a “cycle” vs. a “bomb”). Using this, we investigate three well-known safety fine-tuning methods—supervised safety fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and unlearning—and provide significant evidence demonstrating that these methods minimally transform MLP weights to specifically align unsafe inputs into its weights’ null space. This yields a clustering of inputs based on whether the model deems them safe or not. Correspondingly, when an adversarial input (e.g., a jailbreak) is provided, its activations are closer to safer samples, leading to the model processing such an input as if it were safe. Code is available at https://github.com/fiveai/understanding_safety_finetuning."
Poster,What Makes CLIP More Robust to Long-Tailed Pre-Training Data? A Controlled Study for Transferable Insights,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95296,"Xin Wen, Bingchen Zhao, Yilun Chen, Jiangmiao Pang, Xiaojuan Qi","Severe data imbalance naturally exists among web-scale vision-language datasets. Despite this, we find CLIP pre-trained thereupon exhibits notable robustness to the data imbalance compared to supervised learning, and demonstrates significant effectiveness in learning generalizable representations. With an aim to investigate the reasons behind this finding, we conduct controlled experiments to study various underlying factors, and reveal that CLIP's pretext task forms a dynamic classification problem wherein only a subset of classes is present in training. This isolates the bias from dominant classes and implicitly balances the learning signal. Furthermore, the robustness and discriminability of CLIP improve with more descriptive language supervision, larger data scale, and broader open-world concepts, which are inaccessible to supervised learning. Our study not only uncovers the mechanisms behind CLIP's generalizability beyond data imbalance but also provides transferable insights for the research community. The findings are validated in both supervised and self-supervised learning, enabling models trained on imbalanced data to achieve CLIP-level performance on diverse recognition tasks. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/clip-beyond-tail."
Poster,What Makes Partial-Label Learning Algorithms Effective?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95697,"Jiaqi Lv, Yangfan Liu, Shiyu Xia, Ning Xu, Miao Xu, Gang Niu, Min-Ling Zhang, Masashi Sugiyama, Xin Geng","A partial label (PL) specifies a set of candidate labels for an instance and partial-label learning (PLL) trains multi-class classifiers with PLs.Recently, many methods that incorporate techniques from other domains have shown strong potential.The expectation that stronger techniques would enhance performance has resulted in prominent PLL methods becoming not only highly complicated but also quite different from one another, making it challenging to choose the best direction for future algorithm design.While it is exciting to see higher performance, this leaves open a fundamental question: what makes a PLL method effective?We present a comprehensive empirical analysis of this question and summarize the success of PLL so far into some minimal algorithm design principles.Our findings reveal that high accuracy on benchmark-simulated datasets with PLs can misleadingly amplify the perceived effectiveness of some general techniques, which may improve representation learning but have limited impact on addressing the inherent challenges of PLs. We further identify the common behavior among successful PLL methods as a progressive transition from uniform to one-hot pseudo-labels, highlighting the critical role of mini-batch PL purification in achieving top performance.Based on our findings, we introduce a minimal working algorithm that is surprisingly simple yet effective, and propose an improved strategy to implement the design principles, suggesting a promising direction for improvements in PLL."
Poster,What makes unlearning hard and what to do about it,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95259,"KAIRAN ZHAO, Meghdad Kurmanji, George-Octavian Bărbulescu, Eleni Triantafillou, Peter Triantafillou","Machine unlearning is the problem of removing the effect of a subset of training data (the ``forget set'') from a trained model without damaging the model's utility e.g. to comply with users' requests to delete their data, or remove mislabeled, poisoned or otherwise problematic data.With unlearning research still being at its infancy, many fundamental open questions exist: Are there interpretable characteristics of forget sets that substantially affect the difficulty of the problem? How do these characteristics affect different state-of-the-art algorithms?With this paper, we present the first investigation aiming to answer these questions. We identify two key factors affecting unlearning difficulty and the performance of unlearning algorithms. Evaluation on forget sets that isolate these identified factors reveals previously-unknown behaviours of state-of-the-art algorithms that don't materialize on random forget sets.Based on our insights, we develop a framework coined Refined-Unlearning Meta-algorithm (RUM) that encompasses: (i) refining the forget set into homogenized subsets, according to different characteristics; and (ii) a meta-algorithm that employs existing algorithms to unlearn each subset and finally delivers a model that has unlearned the overall forget set. We find that RUM substantially improves top-performing unlearning algorithms. Overall, we view our work as an important step in (i) deepening our scientific understanding of unlearning and (ii) revealing new pathways to improving the state-of-the-art."
