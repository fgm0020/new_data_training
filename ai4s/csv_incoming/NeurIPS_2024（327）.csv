Poster,Query-Based Adversarial Prompt Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93975,"Jonathan Hayase, Ema Borevković, Nicholas Carlini, Florian Tramer, Milad Nasr","Recent work has shown it is possible to construct adversarial examples that cause aligned language models to emit harmful strings or perform harmful behavior.Existing attacks work either in the white-box setting (with full access to the model weights), or through _transferability_: the phenomenon that adversarial examples crafted on one model often remain effective on other models.We improve on prior work with a _query-based_ attack that leverages API access to a remote language model to construct adversarial examples that cause the model to emit harmful strings with (much) higher probability than with transfer-only attacks.We validate our attack on GPT-3.5 and OpenAI's safety classifier; we can cause GPT-3.5 to emit harmful strings that current transfer attacks fail at, and we can evade the OpenAI and Llama Guard safety classifiers with nearly 100% probability."
Poster,Query-Efficient Correlation Clustering with Noisy Oracle,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94832,"Yuko Kuroki, Atsushi Miyauchi, Francesco Bonchi, Wei Chen","We study a general clustering setting in which we have $n$ elements to be clustered, and we aim to perform as few queries as possible to an oracle that returns a noisy sample of the weighted similarity between two elements. Our setting encompasses many application domains in which the similarity function is costly to compute and inherently noisy. We introduce two novel formulations of online learning problems rooted in the paradigm of Pure Exploration in Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandits (PE-CMAB): fixed confidence and fixed budget settings. For both settings, we design algorithms that combine a sampling strategy with a classic approximation algorithm for correlation clustering and study their theoretical guarantees. Our results are the first examples of polynomial-time algorithms that work for the case of PE-CMAB in which the underlying offline optimization problem is NP-hard."
Poster,Questioning the Survey Responses of Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95348,"Ricardo Dominguez-Olmedo, Moritz Hardt, Celestine Mendler-Dünner","Surveys have recently gained popularity as a tool to study large language models. By comparing models’ survey responses to those of different human reference populations, researchers aim to infer the demographics, political opinions, or values best represented by current language models. In this work, we critically examine language models' survey responses on the basis of the well-established American Community Survey by the U.S. Census Bureau. Evaluating 43 different language models using de-facto standard prompting methodologies, we establish two dominant patterns. First, models' responses are governed by ordering and labeling biases, for example, towards survey responses labeled with the letter “A”. Second, when adjusting for these systematic biases through randomized answer ordering, models across the board trend towards uniformly random survey responses, irrespective of model size or training data. As a result, models consistently appear to better represent subgroups whose aggregate statistics are closest to uniform for the survey under consideration, leading to potentially misguided conclusions about model alignment."
Poster,QUEST: Quadruple Multimodal Contrastive Learning with Constraints and Self-Penalization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93850,"Qi Song, Tianxiang Gong, Shiqi Gao, Haoyi Zhou, Jianxin Li","Multimodal contrastive learning (MCL) has recently demonstrated significant success across various tasks. However, the existing MCL treats all negative samples equally and ignores the potential semantic association with positive samples, which limits the model's ability to achieve fine-grained alignment. In multi-view scenarios, MCL tends to prioritize shared information while neglecting modality-specific unique information across different views, leading to feature suppression and suboptimal performance in downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a novel contrastive framework name *QUEST: Quadruple Multimodal Contrastive Learning with Constraints and Self-Penalization*. In the QUEST framework, we propose quaternion contrastive objectives and orthogonal constraints to extract sufficient unique information. Meanwhile, a shared information-guided penalization is introduced to ensure that shared information does not excessively influence the optimization of unique information. Our method leverages quaternion vector spaces to simultaneously optimize shared and unique information. Experiments on multiple datasets show that our method achieves superior performance in multimodal contrastive learning benchmarks. On public benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, and on synthetic shortcut datasets, we outperform existing baseline methods by an average of 97.95\% on the CLIP model."
Poster,QUEST: Quality-Aware Metropolis-Hastings Sampling for Machine Translation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94343,"Gonçalo Faria, Sweta Agrawal, António Farinhas, Ricardo Rei, José de Souza, André Martins","An important challenge in machine translation (MT) is to generate high-quality and diverse translations. Prior work has shown that the estimated likelihood from the MT model correlates poorly with translation quality. In contrast, quality evaluation metrics (such as COMET or BLEURT) exhibit high correlations with human judgments, which has motivated their use as rerankers (such as quality-aware and minimum Bayes risk decoding). However, relying on a single translation with high estimated quality increases the chances of ""gaming the metric''. In this paper, we address the problem of sampling a set of high-quality and diverse translations. We provide a simple and effective way to avoid over-reliance on noisy quality estimates by using them as the energy function of a Gibbs distribution. Instead of looking for a mode in the distribution, we generate multiple samples from high-density areas through the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a simple Markov chain Monte Carlo approach.  The results show that our proposed method leads to high-quality and diverse outputs across multiple language pairs (English$\leftrightarrow$\{German, Russian\}) with two strong decoder-only LLMs (Alma-7b, Tower-7b)."
Poster,QueST: Self-Supervised Skill Abstractions for Learning Continuous Control,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95334,"Atharva Mete, Haotian Xue, Albert Wilcox, Yongxin Chen, Animesh Garg","Generalization capabilities, or rather a lack thereof, is one of the most important unsolved problems in the field of robot learning, and while several large scale efforts have set out to tackle this problem, unsolved it remains. In this paper, we hypothesize that learning temporal action abstractions using latent variable models (LVMs), which learn to map data to a compressed latent space and back, is apromising direction towards low-level skills that can readily be used for new tasks. Although several works have attempted to show this, they have generally been limited by architectures that do not faithfully capture sharable representations. To address this we present Quantized Skill Transformer (QueST), which learns a larger and more flexible latent encoding that is more capable of modeling the breadth of low-level skills necessary for a variety of tasks. To make use of this extra flexibility, QueST imparts causal inductive bias from the action sequence data into the latent space, leading to more semantically useful and transferable representations. We compare to state-of-the-art imitation learning and LVM baselines and see that QueST’s architecture leads to strong performance on several multitask and few-shot learning benchmarks.

Poster,Queueing Matching Bandits with Preference Feedback,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96929,"Jung-hun Kim, Min-hwan Oh","In this study, we consider multi-class multi-server asymmetric queueing systems consisting of $N$ queues on one side and $K$ servers on the other side, where jobs randomly arrive in queues at each time. The service rate of each job-server assignment is unknown and modeled by a feature-based Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) function. At each time, a scheduler assigns jobs to servers, and each server stochastically serves at most one job based on its preferences over the assigned jobs. The primary goal of the algorithm is to stabilize the queues in the system while learning the service rates of servers. To achieve this goal, we propose algorithms based on UCB and Thompson Sampling, which achieve system stability with an average queue length bound of $O(\min\\{N,K\\}/\epsilon)$ for a large time horizon $T$, where $\epsilon$ is a traffic slackness of the system. Furthermore, the algorithms achieve sublinear regret bounds of $\tilde{O}(\min\\{\sqrt{T}Q_{\max},T^{3/4}\\})$, where $Q_{\max}$ represents the maximum queue length over agents and times.  Lastly, we provide experimental results to demonstrate the performance of our algorithms."
Poster,QVAE-Mole: The Quantum VAE with Spherical Latent Variable Learning for 3-D Molecule Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95150,"Huaijin Wu, Xinyu Ye, Junchi Yan","Molecule generation ideally in its 3-D form has enjoyed wide applications in material, chemistry, life science, etc. We propose the first quantum parametric circuit for 3-D molecule generation for its potential quantum advantage especially considering the arrival of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. We choose the Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) scheme for its simplicity and one-shot generation ability, which we believe is more quantum-friendly compared with the auto-regressive generative models or diffusion models as used in classic approaches. Specifically, we present a quantum encoding scheme designed for 3-D molecules with qubits complexity $\mathcal{O}(C\log n)$ ($n$ is the number of atoms) and adopt a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributed latent space to meet the inherent coherence of the quantum system. We further design to encode conditions into quantum circuits for property-specified generation. Experimentally, our model could generate plausible 3-D molecules and achieve competitive quantitative performance with significantly reduced circuit parameters compared with their classic counterparts. The source code will be released upon publication."
Poster,Q-VLM: Post-training Quantization for Large Vision-Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94107,"Changyuan Wang, Ziwei Wang, Xiuwei Xu, Yansong Tang, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu","In this paper, we propose a post-training quantization framework of large vision-language models (LVLMs) for efficient multi-modal inference. Conventional quantization methods sequentially search the layer-wise rounding functions by minimizing activation discretization errors, which fails to acquire optimal quantization strategy without considering cross-layer dependency. On the contrary, we mine the cross-layer dependency that significantly influences discretization errors of the entire vision-language model, and embed this dependency into optimal quantization strategy searching with low search cost. Specifically, we observe the strong correlation between the activation entropy and the cross-layer dependency concerning output discretization errors. Therefore, we employ the entropy as the proxy to partition blocks optimally, which aims to achieve satisfying trade-offs between discretization errors and the search cost. Moreover, we optimize the visual encoder to disentangle the cross-layer dependency for fine-grained decomposition of search space, so that the search cost is further reduced without harming the quantization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method compresses the memory by 2.78x and increase generate speed by 1.44x about 13B LLaVA model without performance degradation on diverse multi-modal reasoning tasks."
Poster,QWO: Speeding Up Permutation-Based Causal Discovery in LiGAMs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96175,"Mohammad Shahverdikondori, Ehsan Mokhtarian, Negar Kiyavash","Causal discovery is essential for understanding relationships among variables of interest in many scientific domains. In this paper, we focus on permutation-based methods for learning causal graphs in Linear Gaussian Acyclic Models (LiGAMs), where the permutation encodes a causal ordering of the variables. Existing methods in this setting are not scalable due to their high computational complexity. These methods are comprised of two main components: (i) constructing a specific DAG, $\mathcal{G}^\pi$, for a given permutation $\pi$, which represents the best structure that can be learned from the available data while adhering to $\pi$, and (ii) searching over the space of permutations (i.e., causal orders) to minimize the number of edges in $\mathcal{G}^\pi$. We introduce QWO, a novel approach that significantly enhances the efficiency of computing $\mathcal{G}^\pi$ for a given permutation $\pi$. QWO has a speed-up of $O(n^2)$ ($n$ is the number of variables) compared to the state-of-the-art BIC-based method, making it highly scalable. We show that our method is theoretically sound and can be integrated into existing search strategies such as GRASP and hill-climbing-based methods to improve their performance."
