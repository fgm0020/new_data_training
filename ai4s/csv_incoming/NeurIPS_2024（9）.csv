Poster,A Combinatorial Algorithm for the Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport Problem,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94742,"Pankaj Agarwal, Sharath Raghvendra, Pouyan Shirzadian, Keegan Yao","Optimal Transport (OT, also known as the Wasserstein distance) is a popular metric for comparing probability distributions and has been successfully used in many machine-learning applications.In the semi-discrete $2$-Wasserstein problem, we wish to compute the cheapest way to transport all the mass from a continuous distribution $\mu$ to a discrete distribution $\nu$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d\ge 1$, where the cost of transporting unit mass between points $a$ and $b$ is $d(a,b)=||a-b||^2$. When both distributions are discrete, a simple combinatorial framework has been used to find the exact solution (see e.g. [Orlin, STOC 1988]). In this paper, we propose a combinatorial framework for the semi-discrete OT, which can be viewed as an extension of the combinatorial framework for the discrete OT but requires several new ideas. We present a new algorithm that given $\mu$ and $\nu$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and a parameter $\varepsilon>0$, computes an $\varepsilon$-additive approximate semi-discrete transport plan in $O(n^{4}\log n\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time (in the worst case), where $n$ is the support-size of the discrete distribution $\nu$ and we assume that the mass of $\mu$ inside a triangle can be computed in $O(1)$ time. Our algorithm is significantly faster than the known algorithms, and unlike many numerical algorithms, it does not make any assumptions on the smoothness of $\mu$.As an application of our algorithm, we describe a data structure to store a large discrete distribution $\mu$ (with support size $N$) using $O(N)$ space so that, given a query discrete distribution $\nu$ (with support size $k$), an $\varepsilon$-additive approximate transport plan can be computed in $O(k^{3}\sqrt{N}\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time in $2$ dimensions. Our algorithm and data structure extend to higher dimensions as well as to $p$-Wasserstein problem for any $p \ge 1$."
Poster,A Compositional Atlas for Algebraic Circuits,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93754,"Benjie Wang, Denis Mauá, Guy Van den Broeck, YooJung Choi","Circuits based on sum-product structure have become a ubiquitous representation to compactly encode knowledge, from Boolean functions to probability distributions. By imposing constraints on the structure of such circuits, certain inference queries become tractable, such as model counting and most probable configuration. Recent works have explored analyzing probabilistic and causal inference queriesas compositions of basic operators to derive tractability conditions. In this paper, we take an algebraic perspective for compositional inference, and show that a large class of queries—including marginal MAP, probabilistic answer set programming inference, and causal backdoor adjustment—correspond to a combination of basic operators over semirings: aggregation, product, and elementwise mapping. Using this framework, we uncover simple and general sufficient conditions for tractable composition of these operators, in terms of circuit properties (e.g., marginal determinism, compatibility) and conditions on the elementwise mappings. Applying our analysis, we derive novel tractability conditions for many such compositional queries. Our results unify tractability conditions for existing problems on circuits, while providing a blueprint for analysing novel compositional inference queries."
Poster,A Comprehensive Analysis on the Learning Curve in Kernel Ridge Regression,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95771,"Tin Sum Cheng, Aurelien Lucchi, Anastasis Kratsios, David Belius","This paper conducts a comprehensive study of the learning curves of kernel ridge regression (KRR) under minimal assumptions.Our contributions are three-fold: 1) we analyze the role of key properties of the kernel, such as its spectral eigen-decay, the characteristics of the eigenfunctions, and the smoothness of the kernel; 2) we demonstrate the validity of the Gaussian Equivalent Property (GEP), which states that the generalization performance of KRR remains the same when the whitened features are replaced by standard Gaussian vectors, thereby shedding light on the success of previous analyzes under the Gaussian Design Assumption; 3) we derive novel bounds that improve over existing bounds across a broad range of setting such as (in)dependent feature vectors and various combinations of eigen-decay rates in the over/underparameterized regimes."
Poster,A Concept-Based Explainability Framework for Large Multimodal Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95482,"Jayneel Parekh, Pegah KHAYATAN, Mustafa Shukor, Alasdair Newson, Matthieu Cord","Large multimodal models (LMMs) combine unimodal encoders and large language models (LLMs) to perform multimodal tasks. Despite recent advancements towards the interpretability of these models, understanding internal representations of LMMs remains largely a mystery. In this paper, we present a novel framework for the interpretation of LMMs. We propose a dictionary learning based approach, applied to the representation of tokens. The elements of the learned dictionary correspond to our proposed concepts. We show that these concepts are well semantically grounded in both vision and text. Thus we refer to these as ``multi-modal concepts''. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the results of the learnt concepts. We show that the extracted multimodal concepts are useful to interpret representations of test samples. Finally, we evaluate the disentanglement between different concepts and the quality of grounding concepts visually and textually. Our implementation is publicly available: https://github.com/mshukor/xl-vlms."
Poster,A Consistency-Aware Spot-Guided Transformer for Versatile and Hierarchical Point Cloud Registration,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94458,"Renlang Huang, Yufan Tang, Jiming Chen, Liang Li","Deep learning-based feature matching has shown great superiority for point cloud registration in the absence of pose priors. Although coarse-to-fine matching approaches are prevalent, the coarse matching of existing methods is typically sparse and loose without consideration of geometric consistency, which makes the subsequent fine matching rely on ineffective optimal transport and hypothesis-and-selection methods for consistency. Therefore, these methods are neither efficient nor scalable for real-time applications such as odometry in robotics. To address these issues, we design a consistency-aware spot-guided Transformer (CAST), which incorporates a spot-guided cross-attention module to avoid interfering with irrelevant areas, and a consistency-aware self-attention module to enhance matching capabilities with geometrically consistent correspondences. Furthermore, a lightweight fine matching module for both sparse keypoints and dense features can estimate the transformation accurately. Extensive experiments on both outdoor LiDAR point cloud datasets and indoor RGBD point cloud datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, efficiency, and robustness."
Poster,A Continuous-time Stochastic Gradient Descent Method for Continuous Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/98309,"Kexin Jin, Jonas Latz, Chenguang Liu, Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb","Optimization problems with continuous data appear in, e.g., robust machine learning, functional data analysis, and variational inference. Here, the target function is given as an integral over a family of (continuously) indexed target functions---integrated with respect to a probability measure. Such problems can often be solved by stochastic optimization methods:  performing optimization steps with respect to the indexed target function with randomly switched indices. In this work, we study a continuous-time variant of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm for optimization problems with continuous data. This so-called stochastic gradient process consists in a gradient flow minimizing an indexed target function that is coupled with a continuous-time index process determining the index. Index processes are, e.g., reflected diffusions, pure jump processes, or other Lévy processes on compact spaces. Thus, we study multiple sampling patterns for the continuous data space and allow for data simulated or streamed at runtime of the algorithm. We analyze the approximation properties of the stochastic gradient process and study its longtime behavior and ergodicity under constant and decreasing learning rates. We end with illustrating the applicability of the stochastic gradient process in a polynomial regression problem with noisy functional data, as well as in a physics-informed neural network."
Poster,Acoustic Volume Rendering for Neural Impulse Response Fields,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94712,"Zitong Lan, Chenhao Zheng, Zhiwei Zheng, Mingmin Zhao","Realistic audio synthesis that captures accurate acoustic phenomena is essential for creating immersive experiences in virtual and augmented reality. Synthesizing the sound received at any position relies on the estimation of impulse response (IR), which characterizes how sound propagates in one scene along different paths before arriving at the listener position. In this paper, we present Acoustic Volume Rendering (AVR), a novel approach that adapts volume rendering techniques to model acoustic impulse responses. While volume rendering has been successful in modeling radiance fields for images and neural scene representations, IRs present unique challenges as time-series signals. To address these challenges, we introduce frequency-domain volume rendering and use spherical integration to fit the IR measurements. Our method constructs an impulse response field that inherently encodes wave propagation principles and achieves state of-the-art performance in synthesizing impulse responses for novel poses. Experiments show that AVR surpasses current leading methods by a substantial margin. Additionally, we develop an acoustic simulation platform, AcoustiX, which provides more accurate and realistic IR simulations than existing simulators. Code for AVR and AcoustiX are available at https://zitonglan.github.io/avr."
Poster,A Critical Evaluation of AI Feedback for Aligning Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95962,"Archit Sharma, Sedrick Scott Keh, Eric Mitchell, Chelsea Finn, Kushal Arora, Thomas Kollar","Learning from AI feedback (LAIF) is a popular paradigm for improving the instruction-following abilities of powerful pre-trained language models. LAIF first performs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using demonstrations from a teacher model and then further fine-tunes the model with reinforcement learning (RL) or direct preference optimization (DPO), using feedback from a critic model. While recent popular open-source models have demonstrated substantial improvements in performance from the RL step, in this paper we question whether the complexity of this RL step is truly warranted for AI feedback. We show that the improvements of the RL step are virtually entirely due to the widespread practice of using a weaker teacher model (e.g. GPT-3.5) for SFT data collection than the critic (e.g., GPT-4) used for AI feedback generation. Specifically, we show that simple supervised fine-tuning with GPT-4 as the teacher outperforms existing LAIF pipelines. More generally, we find that the gains from LAIF vary substantially across base model families, test-time evaluation protocols, and critic models. Finally, we provide a mechanistic explanation for when SFT may outperform the full two-step LAIF pipeline as well as suggestions for making LAIF maximally useful in practice."
Poster,A Cross-Domain Benchmark for Active Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97719,"Thorben Werner, Johannes Burchert, Maximilian Stubbemann, Lars Schmidt-Thieme","Active Learning (AL) deals with identifying the most informative samples forlabeling to reduce data annotation costs for supervised learning tasks. ALresearch suffers from the fact that lifts from literature generalize poorly andthat only a small number of repetitions of experiments are conducted. To overcomethese obstacles, we propose CDALBench, the first active learning benchmarkwhich includes tasks in computer vision, natural language processing and tabularlearning. Furthermore, by providing an efficient, greedy oracle, CDALBenchcan be evaluated with 50 runs for each experiment. We show, that both thecross-domain character and a large amount of repetitions are crucial forsophisticated evaluation of AL research. Concretely, we show that thesuperiority of specific methods varies over the different domains, making itimportant to evaluate Active Learning with a cross-domain benchmark.Additionally, we show that having a large amount of runs is crucial. With onlyconducting three runs as often done in the literature, the superiority ofspecific methods can strongly vary with the specific runs. This effect is so strong, that, depending on the seed, even a well-established method's performance can be significantly better and significantlyworse than random for the same dataset."
Poster,ActAnywhere: Subject-Aware Video Background Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93659,"Boxiao Pan, Zhan Xu, Chun-Hao Huang, Krishna Kumar Singh, Yang Zhou, Leonidas Guibas, Jimei Yang","We study a novel problem to automatically generate video background that tailors to foreground subject motion. It is an important problem for the movie industry and visual effects community, which traditionally requires tedious manual efforts to solve. To this end, we propose ActAnywhere, a video diffusion model that takes as input a sequence of foreground subject segmentation and an image of a novel background and generates a video of the subject interacting in this background. We train our model on a large-scale dataset of 2.4M videos of human-scene interactions. Through extensive evaluation, we show that our model produces videos with realistic foreground-background interaction while strictly following the guidance of the condition image. Our model generalizes to diverse scenarios including non-human subjects, gaming and animation clips, as well as videos with multiple moving subjects. Both quantitative and qualitative comparisons demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing methods, which fail to accomplish the studied task.
