Poster,A Method for Evaluating Hyperparameter Sensitivity in Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96670,"Jacob Adkins, Michael Bowling, Adam White","The performance of modern reinforcement learning algorithms critically relieson tuning ever increasing numbers of hyperparameters. Often, small changes ina hyperparameter can lead to drastic changes in performance, and different environments require very different hyperparameter settings to achieve state-of-the-artperformance reported in the literature. We currently lack a scalable and widelyaccepted approach to characterizing these complex interactions. This work proposes a new empirical methodology for studying, comparing, and quantifying thesensitivity of an algorithm’s performance to hyperparameter tuning for a given setof environments. We then demonstrate the utility of this methodology by assessingthe hyperparameter sensitivity of several commonly used normalization variants ofPPO. The results suggest that several algorithmic performance improvements may,in fact, be a result of an increased reliance on hyperparameter tuning."
Poster,Amnesia as a Catalyst for Enhancing Black Box Pixel Attacks in Image Classification and Object Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95435,"Dongsu Song, Daehwa Ko, Jay Hoon Jung","It is well known that query-based attacks tend to have relatively higher successrates in adversarial black-box attacks. While research on black-box attacks is activelybeing conducted, relatively few studies have focused on pixel attacks thattarget only a limited number of pixels. In image classification, query-based pixelattacks often rely on patches, which heavily depend on randomness and neglectthe fact that scattered pixels are more suitable for adversarial attacks. Moreover, tothe best of our knowledge, query-based pixel attacks have not been explored in thefield of object detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel pixel-basedblack-box attack called Remember and Forget Pixel Attack using ReinforcementLearning(RFPAR), consisting of two main components: the Remember and Forgetprocesses. RFPAR mitigates randomness and avoids patch dependency byleveraging rewards generated through a one-step RL algorithm to perturb pixels.RFPAR effectively creates perturbed images that minimize the confidence scoreswhile adhering to limited pixel constraints. Furthermore, we advance our proposedattack beyond image classification to object detection, where RFPAR reducesthe confidence scores of detected objects to avoid detection. Experimentson the ImageNet-1K dataset for classification show that RFPAR outperformedstate-of-the-art query-based pixel attacks. For object detection, using the MSCOCOdataset with YOLOv8 and DDQ, RFPAR demonstrates comparable mAPreduction to state-of-the-art query-based attack while requiring fewer query. Furtherexperiments on the Argoverse dataset using YOLOv8 confirm that RFPAReffectively removed objects on a larger scale dataset. Our code is available athttps://github.com/KAU-QuantumAILab/RFPAR."
Poster,A Modular Conditional Diffusion Framework for Image Reconstruction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95501,"Magauiya Zhussip, Iaroslav Koshelev, Stamatios Lefkimmiatis","Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have been recently utilized to deal with various blind image restoration (IR) tasks, where they have demonstrated outstanding performance in terms of perceptual quality. However, the task-specific nature of existing solutions and the excessive computational costs related to their training, make such models impractical and challenging to use for different IR tasks than those that were initially trained for. This hinders their wider adoption especially by those who lack access to powerful computational resources and vast amounts of training data. In this work we aim to address the above issues and enable the successful adoption of DPMs in practical IR-related applications. Towards this goal, we propose a modular diffusion probabilistic IR framework (DP-IR), which allows us to combine the performance benefits of existing pre-trained state-of-the-art IR networks and generative DPMs, while it requires only the additional training of a small module (0.7M params) related to the particular IR task of interest. Moreover, the architecture of our proposed framework allows us to employ a sampling strategy that leads to at least four times reduction of neural function evaluations without any performance loss, while it can also be combined with existing acceleration techniques (e.g. DDIM). We evaluate our model on four benchmarks for the tasks of burst JDD-SR, dynamic scene deblurring, and super-resolution. Our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of perceptual quality while retaining a competitive performance in relation to fidelity metrics."
Poster,AmoebaLLM: Constructing Any-Shape Large Language Models for Efficient and Instant Deployment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95934,"Yonggan Fu, Zhongzhi Yu, Junwei Li, Jiayi Qian, Yongan Zhang, Xiangchi Yuan, Dachuan Shi, Roman Yakunin, Yingyan (Celine) Lin","Motivated by the transformative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across various natural language tasks, there has been a growing demand to deploy these models effectively across diverse real-world applications and platforms. However, the challenge of efficiently deploying LLMs has become increasingly pronounced due to the varying application-specific performance requirements and the rapid evolution of computational platforms, which feature diverse resource constraints and deployment flows. These varying requirements necessitate LLMs that can adapt their structures (depth and width) for optimal efficiency across different platforms and application specifications. To address this critical gap, we propose AmoebaLLM, a novel framework designed to enable the instant derivation of LLM subnets of arbitrary shapes, which achieve the accuracy-efficiency frontier and can be extracted immediately after a one-time fine-tuning. In this way, AmoebaLLM significantly facilitates rapid deployment tailored to various platforms and applications. Specifically, AmoebaLLM integrates three innovative components: (1) a knowledge-preserving subnet selection strategy that features a dynamic-programming approach for depth shrinking and an importance-driven method for width shrinking; (2) a shape-aware mixture of LoRAs to mitigate gradient conflicts among subnets during fine-tuning; and (3) an in-place distillation scheme with loss-magnitude balancing as the fine-tuning objective. Extensive experiments validate that AmoebaLLM not only sets new standards in LLM adaptability but also successfully delivers subnets that achieve state-of-the-art trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency."
Poster,AMOR: A Recipe for Building Adaptable Modular Knowledge Agents Through Process Feedback,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93967,"Jian Guan, Wei Wu, zujie wen, Peng Xu, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang","The notable success of large language models (LLMs) has sparked an upsurge in building language agents to complete various complex tasks. We present AMOR, an agent framework based on open-source LLMs, which reasons with external knowledge bases and adapts to specific domains through human supervision to the reasoning process. AMOR builds reasoning logic over a finite state machine (FSM)that solves problems through autonomous executions and transitions over disentangled modules. This allows humans to provide direct feedback to the individual modules, and thus naturally forms process supervision. Based on this reasoning and feedback framework, we develop AMOR through two-stage fine-tuning: warm-up and adaptation. The former fine-tunes the LLM with examples automatically constructed from various public datasets, enabling AMOR to generalize across different knowledge environments, while the latter tailors AMOR to specific domains using process feedback. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate the advantage of AMOR to strong baselines, thanks to its FSM-based reasoning and process feedback mechanism. The code and data are publicly available athttps://github.com/JianGuanTHU/AMOR."
Poster,Amortized Active Causal Induction with Deep Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96475,"Yashas Annadani, Panagiotis Tigas, Stefan Bauer, Adam Foster","We present Causal Amortized Active Structure Learning (CAASL), an active intervention design policy that can select interventions that are adaptive, real-time and that does not require access to the likelihood. This policy, an amortized network based on the transformer, is trained with reinforcement learning on a simulator of the design environment, and a reward function that measures how close the true causal graph is to a causal graph posterior inferred from the gathered data. On synthetic data and a single-cell gene expression simulator, we demonstrate empirically that the data acquired through our policy results in a better estimate of the underlying causal graph than alternative strategies.  Our design policy successfully achieves amortized intervention design on the distribution of the training environment while also generalizing well to distribution shifts in test-time design environments. Further, our policy also demonstrates excellent zero-shot generalization to design environments with dimensionality higher than that during training, and to intervention types that it has not been trained on."
Poster,Amortized Bayesian Experimental Design for Decision-Making,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92968,"Daolang Huang, Yujia Guo, Luigi Acerbi, Samuel Kaski","Many critical decisions, such as personalized medical diagnoses and product pricing, are made based on insights gained from designing, observing, and analyzing a series of experiments. This highlights the crucial role of experimental design, which goes beyond merely collecting information on system parameters as in traditional Bayesian experimental design (BED), but also plays a key part in facilitating downstream decision-making. Most recent BED methods use an amortized policy network to rapidly design experiments. However, the information gathered through these methods is suboptimal for down-the-line decision-making, as the experiments are not inherently designed with downstream objectives in mind. In this paper, we present an amortized decision-aware BED framework that prioritizes maximizing downstream decision utility. We introduce a novel architecture, the Transformer Neural Decision Process (TNDP), capable of instantly proposing the next experimental design, whilst inferring the downstream decision, thus effectively amortizing both tasks within a unified workflow. We demonstrate the performance of our method across several tasks, showing that it can deliver informative designs and facilitate accurate decision-making."
Poster,Amortized Eigendecomposition for Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95360,"Tianbo Li, Zekun Shi, Jiaxi Zhao, Min Lin","Performing eigendecomposition during neural network training is essential for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, network compression, image denoising, and graph learning. However, eigendecomposition is computationally expensive as it is orders of magnitude slower than other neural network operations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called ""amortized eigendecomposition"" that relaxes the exact eigendecomposition by introducing an additional loss term called eigen loss. Our approach offers significant speed improvements by replacing the computationally expensive eigendecomposition with a more affordable QR decomposition at each iteration. Theoretical analysis guarantees that the desired eigenpair is attained as optima of the eigen loss. Empirical studies on nuclear norm regularization, latent-space principal component analysis, and graphs adversarial learning demonstrate significant improvements in training efficiency while producing nearly identical outcomes to conventional approaches. This novel methodology promises to integrate eigendecomposition efficiently into neural network training, overcoming existing computational challenges and unlocking new potential for advanced deep learning applications."
Poster,Amortized Fourier Neural Operators,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94587,"Zipeng Xiao, Siqi Kou, Hao Zhongkai, Bokai Lin, Zhijie Deng","Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) have shown promise for solving partial differential equations (PDEs).Typically, FNOs employ separate parameters for different frequency modes to specify tunable kernel integrals in Fourier space, which, yet, results in an undesirably large number of parameters when solving high-dimensional PDEs. A workaround is to abandon the frequency modes exceeding a predefined threshold, but this limits the FNOs' ability to represent high-frequency details and poses non-trivial challenges for hyper-parameter specification. To address these, we propose AMortized Fourier Neural Operator (AM-FNO), where an amortized neural parameterization of the kernel function is deployed to accommodate arbitrarily many frequency modes using a fixed number of parameters. We introduce two implementations of AM-FNO, based on the recently developed, appealing Kolmogorov–Arnold Network (KAN) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) equipped with orthogonal embedding functions respectively. We extensively evaluate our method on diverse datasets from various domains and observe up to 31\% average improvement compared to competing neural operator baselines."
Poster,Amortized Planning with Large-Scale Transformers: A Case Study on Chess,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94747,"Anian Ruoss, Grégoire Delétang, Sourabh Medapati, Jordi Grau-Moya, Kevin Li, Elliot Catt, John Reid, Cannada Lewis, Joel Veness, Tim Genewein","This paper uses chess, a landmark planning problem in AI, to assess transformers’ performance on a planning task where memorization is futile — even at a large scale. To this end, we release ChessBench, a large-scale benchmark dataset of 10 million chess games with legal move and value annotations (15 billion data points)  provided by Stockfish 16, the state-of-the-art chess engine. We train transformers with up to 270 million parameters on ChessBench via supervised learning and perform extensive ablations to assess the impact of dataset size, model size, architecture type, and different prediction targets (state-values, action-values, and behavioral cloning). Our largest models learn to predict action-values for novel boards quite accurately, implying highly non-trivial generalization. Despite performing no explicit search, our resulting chess policy solves challenging chess puzzles and achieves a surprisingly strong Lichess blitz Elo of 2895 against humans (grandmaster level). We also compare to Leela Chess Zero and AlphaZero (trained without supervision via self-play) with and without search. We show that, although a remarkably good approximation of Stockfish’s search-based algorithm can be distilled into large-scale transformers via supervised learning, perfect distillation is still beyond reach, thus making ChessBench well-suited for future research."
