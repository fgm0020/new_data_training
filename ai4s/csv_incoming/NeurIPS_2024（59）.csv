Poster,Bridge the Modality and Capability Gaps in Vision-Language Model Selection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96960,"Chao Yi, Yuhang He, De-Chuan Zhan, Han-Jia Ye","Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel in zero-shot image classification by pairing images with textual category names. The expanding variety of Pre-Trained VLMs enhances the likelihood of identifying a suitable VLM for specific tasks. To better reuse the VLM resource and fully leverage its potential on different zero-shot image classification tasks, a promising strategy is selecting appropriate Pre-Trained VLMs from the VLM Zoo, relying solely on the text data of the target dataset without access to the dataset’s images. In this paper, we analyze two inherent challenges in assessing the ability of a VLM in this Language-Only VLM selection: the “Modality Gap”—the disparity in VLM’s embeddings across two different modalities, making text a less reliable substitute for images; and the “Capability Gap”— the discrepancy between the VLM’s overall ranking and its ranking for target dataset, hindering direct prediction of a model’s dataset-specific performance from its general performance. We propose VLM Selection With gAp Bridging (SWAB) to mitigate the negative impact of two gaps. SWAB first adopts optimal transport to capture the relevance between open-source and target datasets with a transportation matrix. It then uses this matrix to transfer useful statistics of VLMs from open-source datasets to the target dataset for bridging two gaps. By bridging two gaps to obtain better substitutes for test images, SWAB can accurately predict the performance ranking of different VLMs on the target task without the need for the dataset’s images. Experiments across various VLMs and image classification datasets validate SWAB’s effectiveness. Code is available at: https://github.com/YCaigogogo/SWAB."
Poster,Bridge the Points: Graph-based Few-shot Segment Anything Semantically,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93949,"Anqi Zhang, Guangyu Gao, Jianbo Jiao, Chi Liu, Yunchao Wei","The recent advancements in large-scale pre-training techniques have significantly enhanced the capabilities of vision foundation models, notably the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which can generate precise masks based on point and box prompts. Recent studies extend SAM to Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS), focusing on prompt generation for SAM-based automatic semantic segmentation. However, these methods struggle with selecting suitable prompts, require specific hyperparameter settings for different scenarios, and experience prolonged one-shot inference times due to the overuse of SAM, resulting in low efficiency and limited automation ability. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective approach based on graph analysis. In particular, a Positive-Negative Alignment module dynamically selects the point prompts for generating masks, especially uncovering the potential of the background context as the negative reference. Another subsequent Point-Mask Clustering module aligns the granularity of masks and selected points as a directed graph, based on mask coverage over points. These points are then aggregated by decomposing the weakly connected components of the directed graph in an efficient manner, constructing distinct natural clusters. Finally, the positive and overshooting gating, benefiting from graph-based granularity alignment, aggregates high-confident masks and filters the false-positive masks for final prediction, reducing the usage of additional hyperparameters and redundant mask generation. Extensive experimental analysis across standard FSS, One-shot Part Segmentation, and Cross Domain FSS datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach, surpassing state-of-the-art generalist models with a mIoU of 58.7% on COCO-20i and 35.2% on LVIS-92i.

Poster,Bridging Gaps: Federated Multi-View Clustering in Heterogeneous Hybrid Views,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95899,"Xinyue Chen, Yazhou Ren, Jie Xu, Fangfei Lin, Xiaorong Pu, Yang Yang","Recently, federated multi-view clustering (FedMVC) has emerged to explore cluster structures in multi-view data distributed on multiple clients. Many existing approaches tend to assume that clients are isomorphic and all of them belong to either single-view clients or multi-view clients. While these methods have succeeded, they may encounter challenges in practical FedMVC scenarios involving heterogeneous hybrid views, where a mixture of single-view and multi-view clients exhibit varying degrees of heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a novel FedMVC framework, which concurrently addresses two challenges associated with heterogeneous hybrid views, i.e., client gap and view gap. To address the client gap, we design a local-synergistic contrastive learning approach that helps single-view clients and multi-view clients achieve consistency for mitigating heterogeneity among all clients. To address the view gap, we develop a global-specific weighting aggregation method, which encourages global models to learn complementary features from hybrid views. The interplay between local-synergistic contrastive learning and global-specific weighting aggregation mutually enhances the exploration of the data cluster structures distributed on multiple clients. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can handle the heterogeneous hybrid views in FedMVC and outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
Poster,Bridging Geometric States via Geometric Diffusion Bridge,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92944,"Shengjie Luo, Yixian Xu, Di He, Shuxin Zheng, Tie-Yan Liu, Liwei Wang","The accurate prediction of geometric state evolution in complex systems is critical for advancing scientific domains such as quantum chemistry and material modeling. Traditional experimental and computational methods face challenges in terms of environmental constraints and computational demands, while current deep learning approaches still fall short in terms of precision and generality. In this work, we introduce the Geometric Diffusion Bridge (GDB), a novel generative modeling framework that accurately bridges initial and target geometric states. GDB leverages a probabilistic approach to evolve geometric state distributions, employing an equivariant diffusion bridge derived by a modified version of Doob's $h$-transform for connecting geometric states. This tailored diffusion process is anchored by initial and target geometric states as fixed endpoints and governed by equivariant transition kernels. Moreover, trajectory data can be seamlessly leveraged in our GDB framework by using a chain of equivariant diffusion bridges, providing a more detailed and accurate characterization of evolution dynamics. Theoretically, we conduct a thorough examination to confirm our framework's ability to preserve joint distributions of geometric states and capability to completely model the underlying dynamics inducing trajectory distributions with negligible error. Experimental evaluations across various real-world scenarios show that GDB surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, opening up a new pathway for accurately bridging geometric states and tackling crucial scientific challenges with improved accuracy and applicability."
Poster,Bridging Model-Based Optimization and Generative Modeling via Conservative Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92964,"Masatoshi Uehara, Yulai Zhao, Ehsan Hajiramezanali, Gabriele Scalia, Gokcen Eraslan, Avantika Lal, Sergey Levine, Tommaso Biancalani","AI-driven design problems, such as DNA/protein sequence design, are commonly tackled from two angles: generative modeling, which efficiently captures the feasible design space (e.g., natural images or biological sequences), and model-based optimization, which utilizes reward models for extrapolation. To combine the strengths of both approaches, we adopt a hybrid method that fine-tunes cutting-edge diffusion models by optimizing reward models through RL. Although prior work has explored similar avenues, they primarily focus on scenarios where accurate reward models are accessible. In contrast, we concentrate on an offline setting where a reward model is unknown, and we must learn from static offline datasets, a common scenario in scientific domains. In offline scenarios, existing approaches tend to suffer from overoptimization, as they may be misled by the reward model in out-of-distribution regions. To address this, we introduce a conservative fine-tuning approach, BRAID, by optimizing a conservative reward model, which includes additional penalization outside of offline data distributions. Through empirical and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to outperform the best designs in offline data, leveraging the extrapolation capabilities of reward models while avoiding the generation of invalid designs through pre-trained diffusion models."
Poster,Bridging Multicalibration and Out-of-distribution Generalization Beyond Covariate Shift,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94486,"Jiayun Wu, Jiashuo Liu, Peng Cui, Steven Wu","We establish a new model-agnostic optimization framework for out-of-distribution generalization via multicalibration, a criterion that ensures a predictor is calibrated across a family of overlapping groups. Multicalibration is shown to be associated with robustness of statistical inference under covariate shift. We further establish a link between multicalibration and robustness for prediction tasks both under and beyond covariate shift. We accomplish this by extending multicalibration to incorporate grouping functions that consider covariates and labels jointly. This leads to an equivalence of the extended multicalibration and invariance, an objective for robust learning in existence of concept shift. We show a linear structure of the grouping function class spanned by density ratios, resulting in a unifying framework for robust learning by designing specific grouping functions. We propose MC-Pseudolabel, a post-processing algorithm to achieve both extended multicalibration and out-of-distribution generalization. The algorithm, with lightweight hyperparameters and optimization through a series of supervised regression steps, achieves superior performance on real-world datasets with distribution shift."
Poster,Bridging OOD Detection and Generalization: A Graph-Theoretic View,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93462,"Han Wang, Sharon Li","In the context of modern machine learning, models deployed in real-world scenarios often encounter diverse data shifts like covariate and semantic shifts, leading to challenges in both out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and detection. Despite considerable attention to these issues separately, a unified framework for theoretical understanding and practical usage is lacking. To bridge the gap, we introduce a graph-theoretic framework to jointly tackle both OOD generalization and detection problems. By leveraging the graph formulation, data representations are obtained through the factorization of the graph's adjacency matrix, enabling us to derive provable error quantifying OOD generalization and detection performance. Empirical results showcase competitive performance in comparison to existing methods, thereby validating our theoretical underpinnings."
Poster,Bridging semantics and pragmatics in information-theoretic emergent communication,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96783,"Eleonora Gualdoni, Mycal Tucker, Roger Levy, Noga Zaslavsky","Human languages support both semantic categorization and local pragmatic interactions that require context-sensitive reasoning about meaning. While semantics and pragmatics are two fundamental aspects of language, they are typically studied independently and their co-evolution is largely under-explored. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by studying how a shared lexicon may emerge from local pragmatic interactions. To this end, we extend a recent information-theoretic framework for emergent communication in artificial agents, which integrates utility maximization, associated with pragmatics, with general communicative constraints that are believed to shape human semantic systems. Specifically, we show how to adapt this framework to train agents via unsupervised pragmatic interactions, and then evaluate their emergent lexical semantics. We test this approach in a rich visual domain of naturalistic images, and find that key human-like properties of the lexicon emerge when agents are guided by both context-specific utility and general communicative pressures, suggesting that both aspects are crucial for understanding how language may evolve in humans and in artificial agents."
Poster,Bridging the Divide: Reconsidering Softmax and Linear Attention,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95169,"Dongchen Han, Yifan Pu, Zhuofan Xia, Yizeng Han, Xuran Pan, Xiu Li, Jiwen Lu, Shiji Song, Gao Huang","Widely adopted in modern Vision Transformer designs, Softmax attention can effectively capture long-range visual information; however, it incurs excessive computational cost when dealing with high-resolution inputs. In contrast, linear attention naturally enjoys linear complexity and has great potential to scale up to higher-resolution images. Nonetheless, the unsatisfactory performance of linear attention greatly limits its practical application in various scenarios. In this paper, we take a step forward to close the gap between the linear and Softmax attention with novel theoretical analyses, which demystify the core factors behind the performance deviations. Specifically, we present two key perspectives to understand and alleviate the limitations of linear attention: the injective property and the local modeling ability. Firstly, we prove that linear attention is not injective, which is prone to assign identical attention weights to different query vectors, thus adding to severe semantic confusion since different queries correspond to the same outputs. Secondly, we confirm that effective local modeling is essential for the success of Softmax attention, in which linear attention falls short. The aforementioned two fundamental differences significantly contribute to the disparities between these two attention paradigms, which is demonstrated by our substantial empirical validation in the paper. In addition, more experiment results indicate that linear attention, as long as endowed with these two properties, can outperform Softmax attention across various tasks while maintaining lower computation complexity.

Poster,Bridging The Gap between Low-rank and Orthogonal Adaptation via Householder Reflection Adaptation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95554,"Shen Yuan, Haotian Liu, Hongteng Xu","While following different technical routes, both low-rank and orthogonal adaptation techniques can efficiently adapt large-scale pre-training models in specific tasks or domains based on a small piece of trainable parameters. In this study, we bridge the gap between these two techniques, proposing a simple but effective adaptation method based on Householder reflections. Given a pre-trained model, our method fine-tunes its layers by multiplying each frozen weight matrix with an orthogonal matrix constructed by a chain of learnable Householder reflections (HRs). This HR-based orthogonal fine-tuning is equivalent to an adaptive low-rank adaptation. Moreover, we show that the orthogonality of the reflection planes corresponding to the HRs impacts the model capacity and regularity. The analysis motivates us to regularize the orthogonality of the HRs, leading to different implementations of the proposed Householder reflection adaptation (HRA) method. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, HRA achieves superior performance with fewer learnable parameters when adapting large language models and conditional image generators. The code of the experiments is available at https://github.com/DaShenZi721/HRA, and the method has been merged into the [PEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) package."
