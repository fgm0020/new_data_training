Poster,DEPrune: Depth-wise Separable Convolution Pruning for Maximizing GPU Parallelism,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95510,"Cheonjun Park, Mincheol Park, Hyunchan Moon, Myung Kuk Yoon, Seokjin Go, Suhyun Kim, Won Woo Ro","Depth-wise Separable Convolution (DSConv) has a powerful representation even with fewer parameters and computation, leading to its adoption by almost all of the state-of-the-art CNN models. DSConv models are already compact making it hard to apply pruning, and there are few  previous pruning techniques that target depth-wise convolution (DW-conv).In this paper, we present Depth-wise Separable Convolution Pruning (DEPrune), a novel pruning method applied to both point-wise and depth-wise convolutions. DEPrune is optimized by analyzing the computation of DSConv on GPUs.DEPrune employs a fine-grained pruning approach, yet it achieves the structured sparsity typically absent in fine-grained pruning, enabling practical hardware acceleration. Moreover, this method maintains a high pruning ratio without causing any accuracy drop.We additionally represent techniques that further enhance DEPrune performance: 1) balanced workload tuning (BWT), and 2) hardware-aware sparsity recalibration (HSR).Experiment results show that DEPrune achieves up to $3.74\times$ practical speedup in DSConv inference on GPUs while maintaining the accuracy of EfficientNet-B0 on ImageNet."
Poster,Depth Anything V2,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94431,"Lihe Yang, Bingyi Kang, Zilong Huang, Zhen Zhao, Xiaogang Xu, Jiashi Feng, Hengshuang Zhao","This work presents Depth Anything V2. Without pursuing fancy techniques, we aim to reveal crucial findings to pave the way towards building a powerful monocular depth estimation model. Notably, compared with V1, this version produces much finer and more robust depth predictions through three key practices: 1) replacing all labeled real images with synthetic images, 2) scaling up the capacity of our teacher model, and 3) teaching student models via the bridge of large-scale pseudo-labeled real images. Compared with the latest models built on Stable Diffusion, our models are significantly more efficient (more than 10x faster) and more accurate. We offer models of different scales (ranging from 25M to 1.3B params) to support extensive scenarios. Benefiting from their strong generalization capability, we fine-tune them with metric depth labels to obtain our metric depth models. In addition to our models, considering the limited diversity and frequent noise in current test sets, we construct a versatile evaluation benchmark with sparse depth annotations to facilitate future research. Models are available at https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2."
Poster,Depth Anywhere: Enhancing 360 Monocular Depth Estimation via Perspective Distillation and Unlabeled Data Augmentation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94862,"Ning-Hsu (Albert) Wang, Yu-Lun Liu","Accurately estimating depth in 360-degree imagery is crucial for virtual reality, autonomous navigation, and immersive media applications. Existing depth estimation methods designed for perspective-view imagery fail when applied to 360-degree images due to different camera projections and distortions. We propose a new depth estimation framework that uses unlabeled 360-degree data effectively. Our approach uses state-of-the-art perspective depth estimation models as teacher models to generate pseudo labels through a six-face cube projection technique, enabling efficient labeling of depth in 360-degree images. This method leverages the increasing availability of large datasets. It includes two main stages: offline mask generation for invalid regions and an online semi-supervised joint training regime. We tested our approach on benchmark datasets such as Matterport3D and Stanford2D3D, showing significant improvements in depth estimation accuracy, particularly in zero-shot scenarios. Our proposed training pipeline can enhance any 360 monocular depth estimator and demonstrate effective knowledge transfer across different camera projections and data types."
Poster,Derandomizing Multi-Distribution Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93304,"Kasper Green Larsen, Omar Montasser, Nikita Zhivotovskiy","Multi-distribution or collaborative learning involves learning a single predictor that works well across multiple data distributions, using samples from each during training. Recent research on multi-distribution learning, focusing on binary loss and finite VC dimension classes, has shown near-optimal sample complexity that is achieved with oracle efficient algorithms. That is, these algorithms are computationally efficient given an efficient ERM for the class. Unlike in classical PAC learning, where the optimal sample complexity is achieved with deterministic predictors, current multi-distribution learning algorithms output randomized predictors. This raises the question: can these algorithms be derandomized to produce a deterministic predictor for multiple distributions? Through a reduction to discrepancy minimization, we show that derandomizing multi-distribution learning is computationally hard, even when ERM is computationally efficient. On the positive side, we identify a structural condition enabling an efficient black-box reduction, converting existing randomized multi-distribution predictors into deterministic ones."
Poster,Derivative-enhanced Deep Operator Network,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94851,"Yuan Qiu, Nolan Bridges, Peng Chen","The deep operator networks (DeepONet), a class of neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces, have recently been developed as surrogate models for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work we propose a derivative-enhanced deep operator network (DE-DeepONet), which leverages derivative information to enhance the solution prediction accuracy and provides a more accurate approximation of solution-to-parameter derivatives, especially when training data are limited. DE-DeepONet explicitly incorporates linear dimension reduction of high dimensional parameter input into DeepONet to reduce training cost and adds derivative loss in the loss function to reduce the number of required parameter-solution pairs. We further demonstrate that the use of derivative loss can be extended to enhance other neural operators, such as the Fourier neural operator (FNO). Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach."
Poster,Derivatives of Stochastic Gradient Descent in parametric optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96443,"Franck Iutzeler, Edouard Pauwels, Samuel Vaiter","We consider stochastic optimization problems where the objective depends on some parameter, as commonly found in hyperparameter optimization for instance. We investigate the behavior of the derivatives of the iterates of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with respect to that parameter and show that they are driven by an inexact SGD recursion on a different objective function, perturbed by the convergence of the original SGD. This enables us to establish that the derivatives of SGD converge to the derivative of the solution mapping in terms of mean squared error whenever the objective is strongly convex. Specifically, we demonstrate that with constant step-sizes, these derivatives stabilize within a noise ball centered at the solution derivative, and that with vanishing step-sizes they exhibit $O(\log(k)^2 / k)$ convergence rates. Additionally, we prove exponential convergence in the interpolation regime.  Our theoretical findings are illustrated by numerical experiments on synthetic tasks."
Poster,Designing Cell-Type-Specific Promoter Sequences Using Conservative Model-Based Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96002,"Aniketh Janardhan Reddy, Xinyang Geng, Michael Herschl, Sathvik Kolli, Aviral Kumar, Patrick Hsu, Sergey Levine, Nilah Ioannidis","Gene therapies have the potential to treat disease by delivering therapeutic genetic cargo to disease-associated cells. One limitation to their widespread use is the lack of short regulatory sequences, or promoters, that differentially induce the expression of delivered genetic cargo in target cells, minimizing side effects in other cell types. Such cell-type-specific promoters are difficult to discover using existing methods, requiring either manual curation or access to large datasets of promoter-driven expression from both targeted and untargeted cells. Model-based optimization (MBO) has emerged as an effective method to design biological sequences in an automated manner, and has recently been used in promoter design methods. However, these methods have only been tested using large training datasets that are expensive to collect, and focus on designing promoters for markedly different cell types, overlooking the complexities associated with designing promoters for closely related cell types that share similar regulatory features. Therefore, we introduce a comprehensive framework for utilizing MBO to design promoters in a data-efficient manner, with an emphasis on discovering promoters for similar cell types. We use conservative objective models (COMs) for MBO and highlight practical considerations such as best practices for improving sequence diversity, getting estimates of model uncertainty, and choosing the optimal set of sequences for experimental validation. Using three leukemia cell lines (Jurkat, K562, and THP1), we show that our approach discovers many novel cell-type-specific promoters after experimentally validating the designed sequences. For K562 cells, in particular, we discover a promoter that has 75.85\% higher cell-type-specificity than the best promoter from the initial dataset used to train our models. Our code and data will be available at https://github.com/young-geng/promoter_design."
Poster,Designs for Enabling Collaboration in Human-Machine Teaming via Interactive and Explainable Systems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94740,"Rohan Paleja, Michael Munje, Kimberlee Chang, Reed Jensen, Matthew Gombolay","Collaborative robots and machine learning-based virtual agents are increasingly entering the human workspace with the aim of increasing productivity and enhancing safety. Despite this, we show in a ubiquitous experimental domain, Overcooked-AI, that state-of-the-art techniques for human-machine teaming (HMT), which rely on imitation or reinforcement learning, are brittle and result in a machine agent that aims to decouple the machine and human’s actions to act independently rather than in a synergistic fashion. To remedy this deficiency, we develop HMT approaches that enable iterative, mixed-initiative team development allowing end-users to interactively reprogram interpretable AI teammates. Our 50-subject study provides several findings that we summarize into guidelines. While all approaches underperform a simple collaborative heuristic (a critical, negative result for learning-based methods), we find that white-box approaches supported by interactive modification can lead to significant team development, outperforming white-box approaches alone, and that black-box approaches are easier to train and result in better HMT performance highlighting a tradeoff between explainability and interactivity versus ease-of-training. Together, these findings present three important future research directions: 1) Improving the ability to generate collaborative agents with white-box models, 2) Better learning methods to facilitate collaboration rather than individualized coordination, and 3) Mixed-initiative interfaces that enable users, who may vary in ability, to improve collaboration."
Poster,DeSparsify: Adversarial Attack Against Token Sparsification Mechanisms,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96104,"Oryan Yehezkel, Alon Zolfi, Amit Baras, Yuval Elovici, Asaf Shabtai","Vision transformers have shown remarkable advancements in the computer vision domain, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in diverse tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection). However, their high computational requirements grow quadratically with the number of tokens used. Token sparsification mechanisms have been proposed to address this issue. These mechanisms employ an input-dependent strategy, in which uninformative tokens are discarded from the computation pipeline, improving the model’s efficiency. However, their dynamism and average-case assumption makes them vulnerable to a new threat vector – carefully crafted adversarial examples capable of fooling the sparsification mechanism, resulting in worst-case performance. In this paper, we present DeSparsify, an attack targeting the availability of vision transformers that use token sparsification mechanisms. The attack aims to exhaust the operating system’s resources, while maintaining its stealthiness. Our evaluation demonstrates the attack’s effectiveness on three token sparsification mechanisms and examines the attack’s transferability between them and its effect on the GPU resources. To mitigate the impact of the attack, we propose various countermeasures."
Poster,DETAIL: Task DEmonsTration Attribution for Interpretable In-context Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96644,"Zijian Zhou, Xiaoqiang Lin, Xinyi Xu, Alok Prakash, Daniela Rus, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low","In-context learning (ICL) allows transformer-based language models that are pre-trained on general text to quickly learn a specific task with a few ""task demonstrations""  without updating their parameters, significantly boosting their flexibility and generality. ICL possesses many distinct characteristics from conventional machine learning, thereby requiring new approaches to interpret this learning paradigm. Taking the viewpoint of recent works showing that transformers learn in context by formulating an internal optimizer, we propose an influence function-based attribution technique, DETAIL, that addresses the specific characteristics of ICL. We empirically verify the effectiveness of our approach for demonstration attribution while being computationally efficient. Leveraging the results, we then show how DETAIL can help improve model performance in real-world scenarios through demonstration reordering and curation. Finally, we experimentally prove the wide applicability of DETAIL by showing our attribution scores obtained on white-box models are transferable to black-box models in improving model performance."
