Poster,Emergence of heavy tails in homogenized stochastic gradient descent,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96047,"Zhezhe Jiao, Martin Keller-Ressel","It has repeatedly been observed that loss minimization by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) leads to heavy-tailed distributions of neural network parameters. Here, we analyze a continuous diffusion approximation of SGD, called homogenized stochastic gradient descent (hSGD), and show in a regularized linear regression framework that it leads to an asymptotically heavy-tailed parameter distribution, even though local gradient noise is Gaussian. We give explicit upper and lower bounds on the tail-index of the resulting parameter distribution and validate these bounds in numerical experiments. Moreover, the explicit form of these bounds enables us to quantify the interplay between optimization hyperparameters and the tail-index. Doing so, we contribute to the ongoing discussion on links between heavy tails and the generalization performance of neural networks as well as the ability of SGD to avoid suboptimal local minima."
Poster,Emergence of Hidden Capabilities: Exploring Learning Dynamics in Concept Space,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93592,"Core Francisco Park, Maya Okawa, Andrew Lee, Ekdeep S Lubana, Hidenori Tanaka","Modern generative models demonstrate impressive capabilities, likely stemming from an ability to identify and manipulate abstract concepts underlying their training data. However, fundamental questions remain: what determines the concepts a model learns, the order in which it learns them, and its ability to manipulate those concepts? To address these questions, we propose analyzing a model’s learning dynamics via a framework we call the concept space, where each axis represents an independent concept underlying the data generating process. By characterizing learning dynamics in this space, we identify how the speed at which a concept is learned, and hence the order of concept learning, is controlled by properties of the data we term concept signal. Further, we observe moments of sudden turns in the direction of a model’s learning dynamics in concept space. Surprisingly, these points precisely correspond to the emergence of hidden capabilities, i.e., where latent interventions show the model possesses the capability to manipulate a concept, but these capabilities cannot yet be elicited via naive input prompting. While our results focus on synthetically defined toy datasets, we hypothesize a general claim on emergence of hidden capabilities may hold: generative models possess latent capabilities that emerge suddenly and consistently during training, though a model might not exhibit these capabilities under naive input prompting."
Poster,emg2pose: A Large and Diverse Benchmark for Surface Electromyographic Hand Pose Estimation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97615,"Sasha Salter, Richard Warren, Collin Schlager, Adrian Spurr, Shangchen Han, Rohin Bhasin, Yujun Cai, Peter Walkington, Anuoluwapo Bolarinwa, Robert Wang, Nathan Danielson, Josh Merel, Eftychios Pnevmatikakis, Jesse Marshall","Hands are the primary means through which humans interact with the world. Reliable and always-available hand pose inference could yield new and intuitive control schemes for human-computer interactions, particularly in virtual and augmented reality. Computer vision is effective but requires one or multiple cameras and can struggle with occlusions, limited field of view, and poor lighting. Wearable wrist-based surface electromyography (sEMG) presents a promising alternative as an always-available modality sensing muscle activities that drive hand motion. However, sEMG signals are strongly dependent on user anatomy and sensor placement; existing sEMG models have thus required hundreds of users and device placements to effectively generalize for tasks other than pose inference. To facilitate progress on sEMG pose inference, we introduce the emg2pose benchmark, which is to our knowledge the first publicly available dataset of high-quality hand pose labels and wrist sEMG recordings. emg2pose contains 2kHz, 16 channel sEMG and pose labels from a 26-camera motion capture rig for 193 users, 370 hours, and 29 stages with diverse gestures - a scale comparable to vision-based hand pose datasets. We provide competitive baselines and challenging tasks evaluating real-world generalization scenarios: held-out users, sensor placements, and stages. This benchmark provides the machine learning community a platform for exploring complex generalization problems, holding potential to significantly enhance the development of sEMG-based human-computer interactions."
Poster,emg2qwerty: A Large Dataset with Baselines for Touch Typing using Surface Electromyography,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97743,"Viswanath Sivakumar, Jeffrey Seely, Alan Du, Sean Bittner, Adam Berenzweig, Anuoluwapo Bolarinwa, Alex Gramfort, Michael Mandel","Surface electromyography (sEMG) non-invasively measures signals generated by muscle activity with sufficient sensitivity to detect individual spinal neurons and richness to identify dozens of gestures and their nuances. Wearable wrist-based sEMG sensors have the potential to offer low friction, subtle, information rich, always available human-computer inputs. To this end, we introduce emg2qwerty, a large-scale dataset of non-invasive electromyographic signals recorded at the wrists while touch typing on a QWERTY keyboard, together with ground-truth annotations and reproducible baselines. With 1,135 sessions spanning 108 users and 346 hours of recording, this is the largest such public dataset to date. These data demonstrate non-trivial, but well defined hierarchical relationships both in terms of the generative process, from neurons to muscles and muscle combinations, as well as in terms of domain shift across users and user sessions. Applying standard modeling techniques from the closely related field of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), we show strong baseline performance on predicting key-presses using sEMG signals alone. We believe the richness of this task and dataset will facilitate progress in several problems of interest to both the machine learning and neuroscientific communities.

Poster,EMGBench: Benchmarking Out-of-Distribution Generalization and Adaptation for Electromyography,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97478,"Jehan Yang, Maxwell Soh, Vivianna Lieu, Douglas Weber, Zackory Erickson","This paper introduces the first generalization and adaptation benchmark using machine learning for evaluating out-of-distribution performance of electromyography (EMG) classification algorithms. The ability of an EMG classifier to handle inputs drawn from a different distribution than the training distribution is critical for real-world deployment as a control interface. By predicting the user’s intended gesture using EMG signals, we can create a wearable solution to control assistive technologies, such as computers, prosthetics, and mobile manipulator robots. This new out-of-distribution benchmark consists of two major tasks that have utility for building robust and adaptable control interfaces: 1) intersubject classification, and 2) adaptation using train-test splits for time-series. This benchmark spans nine datasets, the largest collection of EMG datasets in a benchmark. Among these, a new dataset is introduced, featuring a novel, easy-to-wear high-density EMG wearable for data collection. The lack of open-source benchmarks has made comparing accuracy results between papers challenging for the EMG research community. This new benchmark provides researchers with a valuable resource for analyzing practical measures of out-of-distribution performance for EMG datasets. Our code and data from our new dataset can be found at emgbench.github.io."
Poster,E-Motion: Future Motion Simulation via Event Sequence Diffusion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93547,"Song Wu, Zhiyu Zhu, Junhui Hou, GUANGMING Shi, Jinjian Wu","Forecasting a typical object's future motion is a critical task for interpreting and interacting with dynamic environments in computer vision. Event-based sensors, which could capture changes in the scene with exceptional temporal granularity, may potentially offer a unique opportunity to predict future motion with a level of detail and precision previously unachievable. Inspired by that, we propose to integrate the strong learning capacity of the video diffusion model with the rich motion information of an event camera as a motion simulation framework. Specifically, we initially employ pre-trained stable video diffusion models to adapt the event sequence dataset. This process facilitates the transfer of extensive knowledge from RGB videos to an event-centric domain. Moreover, we introduce an alignment mechanism that utilizes reinforcement learning techniques to enhance the reverse generation trajectory of the diffusion model, ensuring improved performance and accuracy. Through extensive testing and validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various complex scenarios, showcasing its potential to revolutionize motion flow prediction in computer vision applications such as autonomous vehicle guidance, robotic navigation, and interactive media. Our findings suggest a promising direction for future research in enhancing the interpretative power and predictive accuracy of computer vision systems.

Poster,Emotion-LLaMA: Multimodal Emotion Recognition and Reasoning with Instruction Tuning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93492,"Zebang Cheng, Zhi-Qi Cheng, Jun-Yan He, Kai Wang, Yuxiang Lin, Zheng Lian, Xiaojiang Peng, Alexander Hauptmann","Accurate emotion perception is crucial for various applications, including human-computer interaction, education, and counseling.However, traditional single-modality approaches often fail to capture the complexity of real-world emotional expressions, which are inherently multimodal. Moreover, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) face challenges in integrating audio and recognizing subtle facial micro-expressions. To address this, we introduce the MERR dataset, containing 28,618 coarse-grained and 4,487 fine-grained annotated samples across diverse emotional categories. This dataset enables models to learn from varied scenarios and generalize to real-world applications. Furthermore, we propose Emotion-LLaMA, a model that seamlessly integrates audio, visual, and textual inputs through emotion-specific encoders. By aligning features into a shared space and employing a modified LLaMA model with instruction tuning, Emotion-LLaMA significantly enhances both emotional recognition and reasoning capabilities. Extensive evaluations show Emotion-LLaMA outperforms other MLLMs, achieving top scores in Clue Overlap (7.83) and Label Overlap (6.25) on EMER, an F1 score of 0.9036 on MER2023-SEMI challenge, and the highest UAR (45.59) and WAR (59.37) in zero-shot evaluations on DFEW dataset."
Poster,Empowering Active Learning for 3D Molecular Graphs with Geometric Graph Isomorphism,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95817,"Ronast Subedi, Lu Wei, Wenhan Gao, Shayok Chakraborty, Yi Liu","Molecular learning is pivotal in many real-world applications, such as drug discovery. Supervised learning requires heavy human annotation, which is particularly challenging for molecular data, e.g., the commonly used density functional theory (DFT) is highly computationally expensive. Active learning (AL) automatically queries labels for most informative samples, thereby remarkably alleviating the annotation hurdle. In this paper, we present a principled AL paradigm for molecular learning, where we treat molecules as 3D molecular graphs. Specifically, we propose a new diversity sampling method to eliminate mutual redundancy built on distributions of 3D geometries. We first propose a set of new 3D graph isometries for 3D graph isomorphism analysis. Our method is provably at least as expressive as the Geometric Weisfeiler-Lehman (GWL) test. The moments of the distributions of the associated geometries are then extracted for efficient diversity computing. To ensure our AL paradigm selects samples with maximal uncertainties, we carefully design a Bayesian geometric graph neural network to compute uncertainties specifically for 3D molecular graphs. We pose active sampling as a quadratic programming (QP) problem using the proposed components. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our AL paradigm, as well as the proposed diversity and uncertainty methods."
Poster,Empowering and Assessing the Utility of Large Language Models in Crop Science,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97570,"Hang Zhang, Jiawei SUN, Renqi Chen, Wei Liu, Zhonghang Yuan, Xinzhe Zheng, Zhefan Wang, Zhiyuan Yang, Hang Yan, Han-Sen Zhong, Xiqing Wang, Wanli Ouyang, Fan Yang, Nanqing Dong","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy across knowledge-intensive tasks. Nevertheless, their untapped potential in crop science presents an opportunity for advancement. To narrow this gap, we introduce CROP, which includes a novel instruction tuning dataset specifically designed to enhance LLMs’ professional capabilities in the crop science sector, along with a benchmark that serves as a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs’ understanding of the domain knowledge. The CROP dataset is curated through a task-oriented and LLM-human integrated pipeline, comprising 210,038 single-turn and 1,871 multi-turn dialogues related to crop science scenarios. The CROP benchmark includes 5,045 multiple-choice questions covering three difficulty levels. Our experiments based on the CROP benchmark demonstrate notable enhancements in crop science-related tasks when LLMs are fine-tuned with the CROP dataset. To the best of our knowledge, CROP dataset is the first-ever instruction tuning dataset in the crop science domain. We anticipate that CROP will accelerate the adoption of LLMs in the domain of crop science, ultimately contributing to global food production."
Poster,Empowering Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification with Large Foundation Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93497,"Zhangyi Hu, Bin Yang, Mang Ye","Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification (VI-ReID) is a challenging cross-modal retrieval task due to significant modality differences, primarily resulting from the absence of color information in the infrared modality. The development of large foundation models like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) motivates us to explore a feasible solution to empower VI-ReID with off-the-shelf large foundation models. To this end, we propose a novel Text-enhanced VI-ReID framework driven by Large Foundation Models (TVI-LFM). The core idea is to enrich the representation of the infrared modality with textual descriptions automatically generated by VLMs. Specifically, we incorporate a pre-trained VLM to extract textual features from texts generated by VLM and augmented by LLM, and incrementally fine-tune the text encoder to minimize the domain gap between generated texts and original visual modalities. Meanwhile, to enhance the infrared modality with extracted textual representations, we leverage modality alignment capabilities of VLMs and VLM-generated feature-level filters. This enables the text model to learn complementary features from the infrared modality, ensuring the semantic structural consistency between the fusion modality and the visible modality. Furthermore, we introduce modality joint learning to align features across all modalities, ensuring that textual features maintain stable semantic representation of overall pedestrian appearance during complementary information learning. Additionally, a modality ensemble retrieval strategy is proposed to leverage complementary strengths of each query modality to improve retrieval effectiveness and robustness. Extensive experiments on three expanded VI-ReID datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves the retrieval performance, paving the way for the utilization of large foundation models in downstream multi-modal retrieval tasks."
