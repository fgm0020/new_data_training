Poster,Dendritic Integration Inspired Artificial Neural Networks Capture Data Correlation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96812,"Chongming Liu, Jingyang Ma, Songting Li, Douglas (Dongzhuo) Zhou","Incorporating biological neuronal properties into Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to enhance computational capabilities is under active investigation in the field of deep learning. Inspired by recent findings indicating that dendrites adhere to quadratic integration rule for synaptic inputs, this study explores the computational benefits of quadratic neurons. We theoretically demonstrate that quadratic neurons inherently capture correlation within structured data, a feature that grants them superior generalization abilities over traditional neurons. This is substantiated by few-shot learning experiments. Furthermore, we integrate the quadratic rule into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using a biologically plausible approach, resulting in innovative architectures—Dendritic integration inspired CNNs (Dit-CNNs). Our Dit-CNNs compete favorably with state-of-the-art models across multiple classification benchmarks, e.g., ImageNet-1K, while retaining the simplicity and efficiency of traditional CNNs.

Poster,DeNetDM: Debiasing by Network Depth Modulation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96916,"Silpa Vadakkeeveetil Sreelatha, Adarsh Kappiyath, ABHRA CHAUDHURI, Anjan Dutta","Neural networks trained on biased datasets tend to inadvertently learn spurious correlations, hindering generalization. We formally prove that (1) samples that exhibit spurious correlations lie on a lower rank manifold relative to the ones that do not; and (2) the depth of a network acts as an implicit regularizer on the rank of the attribute subspace that is encoded in its representations. Leveraging these insights, we present DeNetDM, a novel debiasing method that uses network depth modulation as a way of developing robustness to spurious correlations. Using a training paradigm derived from Product of Experts, we create both biased and debiased branches with deep and shallow architectures and then distill knowledge to produce the target debiased model. Our method requires no bias annotations or explicit data augmentation while performing on par with approaches that require either or both. We demonstrate that DeNetDM outperforms existing debiasing techniques on both synthetic and real-world datasets by 5\%. The project page is available at https://vssilpa.github.io/denetdm/."
Poster,DenoiseRep: Denoising Model for Representation Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95335,"zhengrui Xu, Guan&#x27;an Wang, Xiaowen Huang, Jitao Sang","The denoising model has been proven a powerful generative model but has little exploration of discriminative tasks. Representation learning is important in discriminative tasks, which is defined as *""learning representations (or features) of the data that make it easier to extract useful information when building classifiers or other predictors""*. In this paper, we propose a novel Denoising Model for Representation Learning (*DenoiseRep*) to improve feature discrimination with joint feature extraction and denoising. *DenoiseRep* views each embedding layer in a backbone as a denoising layer, processing the cascaded embedding layers as if we are recursively denoise features step-by-step. This unifies the frameworks of feature extraction and denoising, where the former progressively embeds features from low-level to high-level, and the latter recursively denoises features step-by-step. After that, *DenoiseRep* fuses the parameters of feature extraction and denoising layers, and *theoretically demonstrates* its equivalence before and after the fusion, thus making feature denoising computation-free. *DenoiseRep* is a label-free algorithm that incrementally improves features but also complementary to the label if available. Experimental results on various discriminative vision tasks, including re-identification (Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, MSMT17, CUHK-03, vehicleID), image classification (ImageNet, UB200, Oxford-Pet, Flowers), object detection (COCO), image segmentation (ADE20K) show stability and impressive improvements. We also validate its effectiveness on the CNN (ResNet) and Transformer (ViT, Swin, Vmamda) architectures."
Poster,Denoising Diffusion Path: Attribution Noise Reduction with An Auxiliary Diffusion Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94481,"Yiming Lei, Zilong Li, Junping Zhang, Hongming Shan","The explainability of deep neural networks (DNNs) is critical for trust and reliability in AI systems. Path-based attribution methods, such as integrated gradients (IG), aim to explain predictions by accumulating gradients along a path from a baseline to the target image. However, noise accumulated during this process can significantly distort the explanation. While existing methods primarily concentrate on finding alternative paths to circumvent noise, they overlook a critical issue: intermediate-step images frequently diverge from the distribution of training data, further intensifying the impact of noise. This work presents a novel Denoising Diffusion Path (DDPath) to tackle this challenge by harnessing the power of diffusionmodels for denoising. By exploiting the inherent ability of diffusion models to progressively remove noise from an image, DDPath constructs a piece-wise linear path. Each segment of this path ensures that samples drawn from a Gaussian distribution are centered around the target image. This approach facilitates a gradual reduction of noise along the path. We further demonstrate that DDPath adheres to essential axiomatic properties for attribution methods and can be seamlessly integrated with existing methods such as IG. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DDPath can significantly reduce noise in the attributions—resulting in clearer explanations—and achieves better quantitative results than traditional path-based methods."
Poster,Dense Associative Memory Through the Lens of Random Features,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96886,"Benjamin Hoover, Duen Horng Chau, Hendrik Strobelt, Parikshit Ram, Dmitry Krotov","Dense Associative Memories are high storage capacity variants of the Hopfield networks that are capable of storing a large number of memory patterns in the weights of the network of a given size. Their common formulations typically require storing each pattern in a separate set of synaptic weights, which leads to the increase of the number of synaptic weights when new patterns are introduced. In this work we propose an alternative formulation of this class of models using random features, commonly used in kernel methods. In this formulation the number of network's parameters remains fixed. At the same time, new memories can be added to the network by modifying existing weights. We show that this novel network closely approximates the energy function and dynamics of conventional Dense Associative Memories and shares their desirable computational properties."
Poster,Dense Connector for MLLMs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95751,"Huanjin Yao, Wenhao Wu, Taojiannan Yang, YuXin Song, Mengxi Zhang, Haocheng Feng, Yifan Sun, Zhiheng Li, Wanli Ouyang, Jingdong Wang","*Do we fully leverage the potential of visual encoder in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)?* The recent outstanding performance of MLLMs in multimodal understanding has garnered broad attention from both academia and industry. In the current MLLM rat race, the focus seems to be predominantly on the linguistic side. We witness the rise of larger and higher-quality instruction datasets, as well as the involvement of larger-sized LLMs. Yet, scant attention has been directed towards the visual signals utilized by MLLMs, often assumed to be the final high-level features extracted by a frozen visual encoder. In this paper, we introduce the **Dense Connector** - a simple, effective, and plug-and-play vision-language connector that significantly enhances existing MLLMs by leveraging multi-layer visual features, with minimal additional computational overhead. Building on this, we also propose the Efficient Dense Connector, which achieves performance comparable to LLaVA-v1.5 with only 25% of the visual tokens. Furthermore, our model, trained solely on images, showcases remarkable zero-shot capabilities in video understanding as well. Experimental results across various vision encoders, image resolutions, training dataset scales, varying sizes of LLMs (2.7B→70B), and diverse architectures of MLLMs (e.g., LLaVA-v1.5, LLaVA-NeXT and Mini-Gemini) validate the versatility and scalability of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 19 image and video benchmarks. We hope that this work will provide valuable experience and serve as a basic module for future MLLM development. Code is available at https://github.com/HJYao00/DenseConnector."
Poster,DenseFormer: Enhancing Information Flow in Transformers via Depth Weighted Averaging,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93902,"Matteo Pagliardini, Amirkeivan Mohtashami, François Fleuret, Martin Jaggi","The transformer architecture by Vaswani et al. (2017) is now ubiquitous across application domains, from natural language processing to speech processing and image understanding. We propose DenseFormer, a simple modification to the standard architecture that improves the perplexity of the model without increasing its size---adding a few thousand parameters for large-scale models in the 100B parameters range. Our approach relies on an additional averaging step after each transformer block, which computes a weighted average of current and past representations---we refer to this operation as Depth-Weighted-Average (DWA). The learned DWA weights exhibit coherent patterns of information flow, revealing the strong and structured reuse of activations from distant layers. Experiments demonstrate that DenseFormer is more data efficient, reaching the same perplexity of much deeper transformer models, and that for the same perplexity, these new models outperform transformer baselines in terms of memory efficiency and inference time."
Poster,DenseFusion-1M: Merging Vision Experts for Comprehensive Multimodal Perception,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97564,"Xiaotong Li, Fan Zhang, Haiwen Diao, Yueze Wang, Xinlong Wang, LINGYU DUAN","Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly emphasize complex understanding of various visual elements, including multiple objects, text information, spatial relations. Their development for comprehensive visual perception hinges on the availability of high-quality image-text datasets that offer diverse visual elements and throughout image descriptions. However, the scarcity of such hyper-detailed datasets currently hinders progress within the MLLM community. The bottleneck stems from the limited perceptual capabilities of current caption engines, which fall short in providing complete and accurate annotations. To facilitate the cutting-edge research of MLLMs on comprehensive vision perception, we thereby propose Perceptual Fusion, using a low-budget but highly effective caption engine for complete and accurate image descriptions.  Specifically, Perceptual Fusion integrates diverse perception experts as image priors to provide explicit information on visual elements and adopts an efficient MLLM as a centric pivot to mimic advanced MLLMs' perception abilities. We carefully select 1M highly representative images from uncurated LAION dataset and generate dense descriptions using our engine, dubbed DenseFusion-1M. Extensive experiments validate that our engine outperforms its counterparts, where the resulting dataset significantly improves the perception and cognition abilities of existing MLLMs across diverse vision-language benchmarks, especially with high-resolution images as inputs. The code and dataset are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/BAAI/DenseFusion-1M."
Poster,Density-based User Representation using Gaussian Process Regression for Multi-interest Personalized Retrieval,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95272,"Haolun Wu, Ofer Meshi, Masrour Zoghi, Fernando Diaz, Xue (Steve) Liu, Craig Boutilier, Maryam Karimzadehgan","Accurate modeling of the diverse and dynamic interests of users remains a significant challenge in the design of personalized recommender systems. Existing user modeling methods, like single-point and multi-point representations, have limitations w.r.t.\ accuracy, diversity, and adaptability. To overcome these deficiencies, we introduce density-based user representations (DURs), a novel method that leverages Gaussian process regression (GPR) for effective multi-interest recommendation and retrieval. Our approach, GPR4DUR, exploits DURs to capture user interest variability without manual tuning, incorporates uncertainty-awareness, and scales well to large numbers of users. Experiments using real-world offline datasets confirm the adaptability and efficiency of GPR4DUR, while online experiments with simulated users demonstrate its ability to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off by effectively utilizing model uncertainty."
Poster,DePLM: Denoising Protein Language Models for Property Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95517,"Zeyuan Wang, Keyan Ding, Ming Qin, Xiaotong Li, Xiang Zhuang, Yu Zhao, Jianhua Yao, Qiang Zhang, Huajun Chen","Protein optimization is a fundamental biological task aimed at enhancing theperformance of proteins by modifying their sequences. Computational methodsprimarily rely on evolutionary information (EI) encoded by protein languagemodels (PLMs) to predict fitness landscape for optimization. However, thesemethods suffer from a few limitations. (1) Evolutionary processes involve thesimultaneous consideration of multiple functional properties, often overshadowingthe specific property of interest. (2) Measurements of these properties tend to betailored to experimental conditions, leading to reduced generalizability of trainedmodels to novel proteins. To address these limitations, we introduce DenoisingProtein Language Models (DePLM), a novel approach that refines the evolutionaryinformation embodied in PLMs for improved protein optimization. Specifically, weconceptualize EI as comprising both property-relevant and irrelevant information,with the latter acting as “noise” for the optimization task at hand. Our approachinvolves denoising this EI in PLMs through a diffusion process conducted in therank space of property values, thereby enhancing model generalization and ensuringdataset-agnostic learning. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated thatDePLM not only surpasses the state-of-the-art in mutation effect prediction butalso exhibits strong generalization capabilities for novel proteins."
