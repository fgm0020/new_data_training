Poster,Nonconvex Federated Learning on Compact Smooth Submanifolds With Heterogeneous Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93275,"Jiaojiao Zhang, Jiang Hu, Anthony Man-Cho So, Mikael Johansson","Many machine learning tasks, such as principal component analysis and low-rank matrix completion, give rise to manifold optimization problems. Although there is a large body of work studying the design and analysis of algorithms for manifold optimization in the centralized setting, there are currently very few works addressing the federated setting. In this paper, we consider nonconvex federated learningover a compact smooth submanifold in the setting of heterogeneous client data. We propose an algorithm that leverages stochastic Riemannian gradients and a manifold projection operator to improve computational efficiency, uses local updates to improve communication efficiency, and avoids client drift. Theoretically, we show that our proposed algorithm converges sub-linearly to a neighborhood of a first-order optimal solution by using a novel analysis that jointly exploits the manifold structure and properties of the loss functions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm has significantly smaller computational and communication overhead than existing methods."
Poster,Non-convolutional graph neural networks.,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95728,"Yuanqing Wang, Kyunghyun Cho","Rethink convolution-based graph neural networks (GNN)---they characteristically suffer from limited expressiveness, over-smoothing, and over-squashing, and require specialized sparse kernels for efficient computation.Here, we design a simple graph learning module entirely free of convolution operators, coined _random walk with unifying memory_ (RUM) neural network, where an RNN merges the topological and semantic graph features along the random walks terminating at each node.Relating the rich literature on RNN behavior and graph topology, we theoretically show and experimentally verify that RUM attenuates the aforementioned symptoms and is more expressive than the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) isomorphism test.On a variety of node- and graph-level classification and regression tasks, RUM not only achieves competitive performance, but is also robust, memory-efficient, scalable, and faster than the simplest convolutional GNNs."
Poster,Non-Euclidean Mixture Model for Social Network Embedding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93658,"Roshni Iyer, Yewen Wang, Wei Wang, Yizhou Sun","It is largely agreed that social network links are formed due to either homophily or social influence. Inspired by this, we aim at understanding the generation of links via providing a novel embedding-based graph formation model. Different from existing graph representation learning, where link generation probabilities are defined as a simple function of the corresponding node embeddings, we model the link generation as a mixture model of the two factors. In addition, we model the homophily factor in spherical space and the influence factor in hyperbolic space to accommodate the fact that (1) homophily results in cycles and (2) influence results in hierarchies in networks. We also design a special projection to align these two spaces. We call this model Non-Euclidean Mixture Model, i.e., NMM. We further integrate NMM with our non-Euclidean graph variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, NMM-GNN. NMM-GNN learns embeddings through a unified framework which uses non-Euclidean GNN encoders, non-Euclidean Gaussian priors, a non-Euclidean decoder, and a novel space unification loss component to unify distinct non-Euclidean geometric spaces. Experiments on public datasets show NMM-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on social network generation and classification tasks, demonstrating its ability to better explain how the social network is formed."
Poster,Non-geodesically-convex optimization in the Wasserstein space,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95610,"Hoang Phuc Hau Luu, Hanlin Yu, Bernardo Williams, Petrus Mikkola, Marcelo Hartmann, Kai Puolamäki, Arto Klami","We study a class of optimization problems in the Wasserstein space (the space of probability measures) where the objective function is nonconvex along generalized geodesics. Specifically, the objective exhibits some difference-of-convex structure along these geodesics. The setting also encompasses sampling problems where the logarithm of the target distribution is difference-of-convex. We derive multiple convergence insights for a novel semi Forward-Backward Euler scheme under several nonconvex (and possibly nonsmooth) regimes. Notably, the semi Forward-Backward Euler is just a slight modification of the Forward-Backward Euler whose convergence is---to our knowledge---still unknown in our very general non-geodesically-convex setting."
Poster,Nonlinear dynamics of localization in neural receptive fields,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93650,"Leon Lufkin, Andrew Saxe, Erin Grant","Localized receptive fields—neurons that are selective for certain contiguous spatiotemporal features of their input—populate early sensory regions of the mammalian brain. Unsupervised learning algorithms that optimize explicit sparsity or independence criteria replicate features of these localized receptive fields, but fail to explain directly how localization arises through learning without efficient coding, as occurs in early layers of deep neural networks and might occur in early sensory regions of biological systems. We consider an alternative model in which localized receptive fields emerge without explicit top-down efficiency constraints—a feed-forward neural network trained on a data model inspired by the structure of natural images. Previous work identified the importance of non-Gaussian statistics to localization in this setting but left open questions about the mechanisms driving dynamical emergence. We address these questions by deriving the effective learning dynamics for a single nonlinear neuron, making precise how higher-order statistical properties of the input data drive emergent localization, and we demonstrate that the predictions of these effective dynamics extend to the many-neuron setting. Our analysis provides an alternative explanation for the ubiquity of localization as resulting from the nonlinear dynamics of learning in neural circuits"
Poster,Nonlocal Attention Operator: Materializing Hidden Knowledge Towards Interpretable Physics Discovery,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93271,"Yue Yu, Ning Liu, Fei Lu, Tian Gao, Siavash Jafarzadeh, Stewart A Silling","Despite recent popularity of attention-based neural architectures in core AI fields like natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), their potential in modeling complex physical systems remains under-explored. Learning problems in physical systems are often characterized as discovering operators that map between function spaces based on a few instances of function pairs. This task frequently presents a severely ill-posed PDE inverse problem. In this work, we propose a novel neural operator architecture based on the attention mechanism, which we coin Nonlocal Attention Operator (NAO), and explore its capability towards developing a foundation physical model. In particular, we show that the attention mechanism is equivalent to a double integral operator that enables nonlocal interactions among spatial tokens, with a data-dependent kernel characterizing the inverse mapping from data to the hidden parameter field of the underlying operator. As such, the attention mechanism extracts global prior information from training data generated by multiple systems, and suggests the exploratory space in the form of a nonlinear kernel map. Consequently, NAO can address ill-posedness and rank deficiency in inverse PDE problems by encoding regularization and achieving generalizability. Lastly, we empirically demonstrate the advantages of NAO over baseline neural models in terms of the generalizability to unseen data resolutions and system states. Our work not only suggests a novel neural operator architecture for learning an interpretable foundation model of physical systems, but also offers a new perspective towards understanding the attention mechanism."
Poster,Nonparametric Classification on Low Dimensional Manifolds using Overparameterized Convolutional Residual Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94112,"Zixuan Zhang, Kaiqi Zhang, Minshuo Chen, Yuma Takeda, Mengdi Wang, Tuo Zhao, Yu-Xiang Wang","Convolutional residual neural networks (ConvResNets), though overparametersized, can achieve remarkable prediction performance in practice, which cannot be well explained by conventional wisdom. To bridge this gap, we study the performance of ConvResNeXts trained with weight decay, which cover ConvResNets as a special case, from the perspective of nonparametric classification. Our analysis allows for infinitely many building blocks in ConvResNeXts, and shows that weight decay implicitly enforces sparsity on these blocks. Specifically, we consider a smooth target function supported on a low-dimensional manifold, then prove that ConvResNeXts can adapt to the function smoothness and low-dimensional structures and efficiently learn the function without suffering from the curse of dimensionality. Our findings partially justify the advantage of overparameterized ConvResNeXts over conventional machine learning models."
Poster,Non-parametric classification via expand-and-sparsify representation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96917,Kaushik Sinha,"In *expand-and-sparsify* (EaS) representation, a data point in $\mathcal{S}^{d-1}$ is first randomly mapped to higher dimension $\mathbb{R}^m$, where $m>d$, followed by a sparsification operation where the informative $k \ll m$ of the $m$ coordinates are set to one and the rest are set to zero. We propose two algorithms for non-parametric classification using such EaS representation. For our first algorithm, we use *winners-take-all* operation for the sparsification step and show that the proposed classifier admits the form of a locally weighted average classifier and establish its consistency via Stone's Theorem. Further, assuming that the conditional probability function $P(y=1|x)=\eta(x)$ is H\""{o}lder continuous and for optimal choice of $m$, we show that the convergence rate of this classifier is minimax-optimal. For our second algorithm, we use *empirical $k$-thresholding* operation for the sparsification step, and under the assumption that data lie on a low dimensional manifold of dimension $d_0\ll d$, we show that the convergence rate of this classifier depends only on $d_0$ and is again minimax-optimal. Empirical evaluations performed on real-world datasets corroborate our theoretical results."
Poster,Nonparametric Evaluation of Noisy ICA Solutions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95900,"Syamantak Kumar, Derek Bean, peter j bickel, Purnamrita Sarkar","Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was introduced in the 1980's as a model for Blind Source Separation (BSS), which refers to the process of recovering the sources underlying a mixture of signals, with little knowledge about the source signals or the mixing process. While there are many sophisticated algorithms for estimation, different methods have different shortcomings. In this paper, we develop a nonparametric score to adaptively pick the right algorithm for ICA with arbitrary Gaussian noise. The novelty of this score stems from the fact that it just assumes a finite second moment of the data and uses the characteristic function to evaluate the quality of the estimated mixing matrix without any knowledge of the parameters of the noise distribution. In addition, we propose some new contrast functions and algorithms that enjoy the same fast computability as existing algorithms like FASTICA and JADE but work in domains where the former may fail. While these also may have weaknesses, our proposed diagnostic, as shown by our simulations, can remedy them. Finally, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze the local and global convergence properties of our algorithms."
Poster,Nonparametric Instrumental Variable Regression through Stochastic Approximate Gradients,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94871,"Yuri Fonseca, Caio Peixoto, Yuri Saporito","Instrumental variables (IVs) provide a powerful strategy for identifying causal effects in the presence of unobservable confounders. Within the nonparametric setting (NPIV), recent methods have been based on nonlinear generalizations of Two-Stage Least Squares and on minimax formulations derived from moment conditions or duality. In a novel direction, we show how to formulate a functional stochastic gradient descent algorithm to tackle NPIV regression by directly minimizing the populational risk. We provide theoretical support in the form of bounds on the excess risk, and conduct numerical experiments showcasing our method's superior stability and competitive performance relative to current state-of-the-art alternatives. This algorithm enables flexible estimator choices, such as neural networks or kernel based methods, as well as non-quadratic loss functions, which may be suitable for structural equations beyond the setting of continuous outcomes and additive noise. Finally, we demonstrate this flexibility of our framework by presenting how it naturally addresses the important case of binary outcomes, which has received far less attention by recent developments in the NPIV literature."
