Poster,Pearls from Pebbles: Improved Confidence Functions for Auto-labeling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96327,"Harit Vishwakarma, Yi Chen, Sui Jiet Tay, Satya Sai Srinath Namburi, Frederic Sala, Ramya Korlakai Vinayak","Auto-labeling is an important family of techniques that produce labeled training sets with minimum manual annotation. A prominent variant, threshold-based auto-labeling (TBAL), works by finding thresholds on a model's confidence scores above which it can accurately automatically label unlabeled data. However, many models are known to produce overconfident scores, leading to poor TBAL  performance. While a natural idea is to apply off-the-shelf calibration methods to alleviate the overconfidence issue, we show that such methods fall short. Rather than experimenting with ad-hoc choices of confidence functions, we propose a framework for studying the optimal TBAL confidence function. We develop a tractable version of the framework to obtain Colander (Confidence functions for Efficient and Reliable Auto-labeling), a new post-hoc method specifically designed to maximize performance in TBAL systems. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation of Colander and compare it against methods designed for calibration. Colander achieves up to 60% improvement on coverage over the baselines while maintaining error level below 5% and using the same amount of labeled data."
Poster,Pedestrian-Centric 3D Pre-collision Pose and Shape Estimation from Dashcam Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93814,"MeiJun Wang, Yu Meng, Zhongwei Qiu, Chao Zheng, Yan Xu, Pengxiaorui, Jian Gao","Pedestrian pre-collision pose is one of the key factors to determine the degree of pedestrian-vehicle injury in collision. Human pose estimation algorithm is an effective method to estimate pedestrian emergency pose from accident video. However, the pose estimation model trained by the existing daily human pose datasets has poor robustness under specific poses such as pedestrian pre-collision pose, and it is difficult to obtain human pose datasets in the wild scenes, especially lacking scarce data such as pedestrian pre-collision pose in traffic scenes. In this paper, we collect pedestrian-vehicle collision pose from the dashcam perspective of dashcam and construct the first Pedestrian-Vehicle Collision Pose dataset (PVCP) in a semi-automatic way, including 40k+ accident frames and 20K+ pedestrian pre-collision pose annotation (2D, 3D, Mesh). Further, we construct a Pedestrian Pre-collision Pose Estimation Network (PPSENet) to estimate the collision pose and shape sequence of pedestrians from pedestrian-vehicle accident videos. The PPSENet first estimates the 2D pose from the image (Image to Pose, ITP) and then lifts the 2D pose to 3D mesh (Pose to Mesh, PTM). Due to the small size of the dataset, we introduce a pre-training model that learns the human pose prior on a large number of pose datasets, and use iterative regression to estimate the pre-collision pose and shape of pedestrians. Further, we classify the pre-collision pose sequence and introduce pose class loss, which achieves the best accuracy compared with the existing relevant \textit{state-of-the-art} methods.

Poster,"Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction with Missing Data: Datasets, Imputation, and Benchmarking",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97642,"Pranav Singh Chib, Pravendra Singh","Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for several applications such as robotics and self-driving vehicles. Significant progress has been made in the past decade thanks to the availability of pedestrian trajectory datasets, which enable trajectory prediction methods to learn from pedestrians' past movements and predict future trajectories. However, these datasets and methods typically assume that the observed trajectory sequence is complete, ignoring real-world issues such as sensor failure, occlusion, and limited fields of view that can result in missing values in observed trajectories. To address this challenge, we present TrajImpute, a pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset that simulates missing coordinates in the observed trajectory, enhancing real-world applicability. TrajImpute maintains a uniform distribution of missing data within the observed trajectories. In this work, we comprehensively examine several imputation methods to reconstruct the missing coordinates and benchmark them for imputing pedestrian trajectories. Furthermore, we provide a thorough analysis of recent trajectory prediction methods and evaluate the performance of these models on the imputed trajectories. Our experimental evaluation of the imputation and trajectory prediction methods offers several valuable insights. Our dataset provides a foundational resource for future research on imputation-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction, potentially accelerating the deployment of these methods in real-world applications. Publicly accessible links to the datasets and code files are available at https://github.com/Pranav-chib/TrajImpute."
Poster,PediatricsGPT: Large Language Models as Chinese Medical Assistants for Pediatric Applications,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94806,"Dingkang Yang, Jinjie Wei, Dongling Xiao, Shunli Wang, Tong Wu, Gang Li, Mingcheng Li, Shuaibing Wang, Jiawei Chen, Yue Jiang, Qingyao Xu, Ke Li, Peng Zhai, Lihua Zhang","Developing intelligent pediatric consultation systems offers promising prospects for improving diagnostic efficiency, especially in China, where healthcare resources are scarce. Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for Chinese medicine, their performance is sub-optimal in pediatric applications due to inadequate instruction data and vulnerable training procedures.To address the above issues, this paper builds PedCorpus, a high-quality dataset of over 300,000 multi-task instructions from pediatric textbooks, guidelines, and knowledge graph resources to fulfil diverse diagnostic demands. Upon well-designed PedCorpus, we propose PediatricsGPT, the first Chinese pediatric LLM assistant built on a systematic and robust training pipeline.In the continuous pre-training phase, we introduce a hybrid instruction pre-training mechanism to mitigate the internal-injected knowledge inconsistency of LLMs for medical domain adaptation. Immediately, the full-parameter Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is utilized to incorporate the general medical knowledge schema into the models. After that, we devise a direct following preference optimization to enhance the generation of pediatrician-like humanistic responses. In the parameter-efficient secondary SFT phase,a mixture of universal-specific experts strategy is presented to resolve the competency conflict between medical generalist and pediatric expertise mastery. Extensive results based on the metrics, GPT-4, and doctor evaluations on distinct downstream tasks show that PediatricsGPT consistently outperforms previous Chinese medical LLMs. The project and data will be released at https://github.com/ydk122024/PediatricsGPT."
Poster,Penalty-based Methods for Simple Bilevel Optimization under Hölderian Error Bounds,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93627,"Pengyu Chen, Xu Shi, Rujun Jiang, Jiulin Wang","This paper investigates simple bilevel optimization problems where we minimize a convex upper-level objective over the optimal solution set of a convex lower-level objective. Existing methods for such problems either only guarantee asymptotic convergence, have slow sublinear rates, or require strong assumptions. To address these challenges, we propose a penalization framework that delineates the relationship between approximate solutions of the original problem and its reformulated counterparts. This framework accommodates varying assumptions regarding smoothness and convexity, enabling the application of specific methods with different complexity results. Specifically, when both upper- and lower-level objectives are composite convex functions, under an $\alpha$-Hölderian error bound condition and certain mild assumptions, our algorithm attains an $(\epsilon,\epsilon^{\beta})$-optimal solution of the original problem for any $\beta> 0$ within $\mathcal{O}\left(\sqrt{{1}/{\epsilon^{\max\\{\alpha,\beta\\}}}}\right)$ iterations. The result can be improved further if the smooth part of the upper-level objective is strongly convex. We also establish complexity results when the upper- and lower-level objectives are general nonsmooth functions. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms."
Poster,Perceiving Longer Sequences With Bi-Directional Cross-Attention Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96564,"Markus Hiller, Krista A. Ehinger, Tom Drummond","We present a novel bi-directional Transformer architecture (BiXT) which scales linearly with input size in terms of computational cost and memory consumption, but does not suffer the drop in performance or limitation to only one input modality seen with other efficient Transformer-based approaches. BiXT is inspired by the Perceiver architectures but replaces iterative attention with an efficient bi-directional cross-attention module in which input tokens and latent variables attend to each other simultaneously, leveraging a naturally emerging attention-symmetry between the two. This approach unlocks a key bottleneck experienced by Perceiver-like architectures and enables the processing and interpretation of both semantics ('what') and location ('where') to develop alongside each other over multiple layers -- allowing its direct application to dense and instance-based tasks alike. By combining efficiency with the generality and performance of a full Transformer architecture, BiXT can process longer sequences like point clouds, text or images at higher feature resolutions and achieves competitive performance across a range of tasks like point cloud part segmentation, semantic image segmentation, image classification, hierarchical sequence modeling and document retrieval. Our experiments demonstrate that BiXT models outperform larger competitors by leveraging longer sequences more efficiently on vision tasks like classification and segmentation, and perform on par with full Transformer variants on sequence modeling and document retrieval -- but require 28\% fewer FLOPs and are up to $8.4\times$ faster."
Poster,Perception of Knowledge Boundary for Large Language Models through Semi-open-ended Question Answering,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95575,"Zhihua Wen, Zhiliang Tian, Zexin Jian, Zhen Huang, Pei Ke, Yifu Gao, Minlie Huang, Dongsheng Li","Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for knowledge-seeking purposes yet suffer from hallucinations. The knowledge boundary of an LLM limits its factual understanding, beyond which it may begin to hallucinate. Investigating the perception of LLMs' knowledge boundary is crucial for detecting hallucinations and LLMs' reliable generation. Current studies perceive LLMs' knowledge boundary on questions with concrete answers (close-ended questions) while paying limited attention to semi-open-ended questions that correspond to many potential answers. Some researchers achieve it by judging whether the question is answerable or not. However, this paradigm is not so suitable for semi-open-ended questions, which are usually ``partially answerable questions'' containing both answerable answers and ambiguous (unanswerable) answers. Ambiguous answers are essential for knowledge-seeking, but it may go beyond the knowledge boundary of LLMs. In this paper, we perceive the LLMs' knowledge boundary with semi-open-ended questions by discovering more ambiguous answers. First, we apply an LLM-based approach to construct semi-open-ended questions and obtain answers from a target LLM. Unfortunately, the output probabilities of mainstream black-box LLMs are inaccessible to sample more low-probability ambiguous answers. Therefore, we apply an open-sourced auxiliary model to explore ambiguous answers for the target LLM. We calculate the nearest semantic representation for existing answers to estimate their probabilities, with which we reduce the generation probability of high-probability existing answers to achieve a more effective generation. Finally, we compare the results from the RAG-based evaluation and LLM self-evaluation to categorize four types of ambiguous answers that are beyond the knowledge boundary of the target LLM. Following our method, we construct a dataset to perceive the knowledge boundary for GPT-4. We find that GPT-4 performs poorly on semi-open-ended questions and is often unaware of its knowledge boundary. Besides, our auxiliary model, LLaMA-2-13B, is effective in discovering many ambiguous answers, including correct answers neglected by GPT-4 and delusive wrong answers GPT-4 struggles to identify."
Poster,Perceptual Fairness in Image Restoration,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95549,"Guy Ohayon, Michael Elad, Tomer Michaeli","Fairness in image restoration tasks is the desire to treat different sub-groups of images equally well. Existing definitions of fairness in image restoration are highly restrictive. They consider a reconstruction to be a correct outcome for a group (e.g., women) *only* if it falls within the group's set of ground truth images (e.g., natural images of women); otherwise, it is considered *entirely* incorrect. Consequently, such definitions are prone to controversy, as errors in image restoration can manifest in various ways. In this work we offer an alternative approach towards fairness in image restoration, by considering the *Group Perceptual Index* (GPI), which we define as the statistical distance between the distribution of the group's ground truth images and the distribution of their reconstructions. We assess the fairness of an algorithm by comparing the GPI of different groups, and say that it achieves perfect *Perceptual Fairness* (PF) if the GPIs of all groups are identical. We motivate and theoretically study our new notion of fairness, draw its connection to previous ones, and demonstrate its utility on state-of-the-art face image restoration algorithms."
Poster,PeRFlow: Piecewise Rectified Flow as Universal Plug-and-Play Accelerator,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93469,"Hanshu Yan, Xingchao Liu, Jiachun Pan, Jun Hao Liew, Qiang Liu, Jiashi Feng","We present Piecewise Rectified Flow (PeRFlow), a flow-based method for accelerating diffusion models. PeRFlow divides the sampling process of generative flows into several time windows and straightens the trajectories in each interval via the reflow operation, thereby approaching piecewise linear flows. PeRFlow achieves superior performance in a few-step generation. Moreover, through dedicated parameterizations, the PeRFlow models inherit knowledge from the pretrained diffusion models. Thus, the training converges fast and the obtained models show advantageous transfer ability, serving as universal plug-and-play accelerators that are compatible with various workflows based on the pre-trained diffusion models."
Poster,Performative Control for Linear Dynamical Systems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96423,"Songfu Cai, Fei Han, Xuanyu Cao","We introduce the framework of performative control, where the policy chosen by the controller affects the underlying dynamics of the control system. This results in a sequence of policy-dependent system state data with policy-dependent temporal correlations. Following the recent literature on performative prediction \cite{perdomo2020performative}, we introduce the concept of a performatively stable control (PSC) solution. We first propose a sufficient condition for the performative control problem to admit a unique PSC solution with a problem-specific structure of distributional sensitivity propagation and aggregation. We further analyze the impacts of system stability on the existence of the PSC solution. Specifically, for {almost surely strongly stable} policy-dependent dynamics, the PSC solution exists if the sum of the distributional sensitivities is small enough. However, for almost surely unstable policy-dependent dynamics, the existence of the PSC solution will necessitate a temporally backward decaying of the distributional sensitivities. We finally provide a repeated stochastic gradient descent scheme that converges to the PSC solution and analyze its non-asymptotic convergence rate. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis."
