Poster,Efficient Adversarial Training in LLMs with Continuous Attacks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96357,"Sophie Xhonneux, Alessandro Sordoni, Stephan Günnemann, Gauthier Gidel, Leo Schwinn","Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can bypass their safety guardrails. In many domains, adversarial training has proven to be one of the most promising methods to reliably improve robustness against such attacks. Yet, in the context of LLMs, current methods for adversarial training are hindered by the high computational costs required to perform discrete adversarial attacks at each training iteration. We address this problem by instead calculating adversarial attacks in the continuous embedding space of the LLM, which is orders of magnitudes more efficient. We propose a fast adversarial training algorithm (C-AdvUL) composed of two losses: the first makes the model robust on continuous embedding attacks computed on an adversarial behaviour dataset; the second ensures the usefulness of the final model by fine-tuning on utility data. Moreover, we introduce C-AdvIPO, an adversarial variant of IPO that does not require utility data for adversarially robust alignment. Our empirical evaluation on five models from different families (Gemma, Phi3, Mistral, Zephyr, Llama2) and at different scales (2B, 3.8B, 7B) shows that both algorithms substantially enhance LLM robustness against discrete attacks (GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR), while maintaining utility. Our results demonstrate that robustness to continuous perturbations can extrapolate to discrete threat models. Thereby, we present a path toward scalable adversarial training algorithms for robustly aligning LLMs."
Poster,Efficient and Private Marginal Reconstruction with Local Non-Negativity,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93838,"Brett Mullins, Miguel Fuentes, Yingtai Xiao, Daniel Kifer, Cameron Musco, Daniel Sheldon","Differential privacy is the dominant standard for formal and quantifiable privacy and has been used in major deployments that impact millions of people. Many differentially private algorithms for query release and synthetic data contain steps that reconstruct answers to queries from answers to other queries that have been measured privately.  Reconstruction is an important subproblem for such mechanisms to economize the privacy budget, minimize error on reconstructed answers, and allow for scalability to high-dimensional datasets. In this paper, we introduce a principled and efficient postprocessing method ReM (Residuals-to-Marginals) for reconstructing answers to marginal queries. Our method builds on recent work on efficient mechanisms for marginal query release, based on making measurements using a residual query basis that admits efficient pseudoinversion, which is an important primitive used in reconstruction. An extension GReM-LNN (Gaussian Residuals-to-Marginals with Local Non-negativity) reconstructs marginals under Gaussian noise satisfying consistency and non-negativity, which often reduces error on reconstructed answers.  We demonstrate the utility of ReM and GReM-LNN by applying them to improve existing private query answering mechanisms."
Poster,Efficient and Sharp Off-Policy Evaluation in Robust Markov Decision Processes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95603,"Andrew Bennett, Nathan Kallus, Miruna Oprescu, Wen Sun, Kaiwen Wang","We study the evaluation of a policy under best- and worst-case perturbations to a Markov decision process (MDP), using transition observations from the original MDP, whether they are generated under the same or a different policy. This is an important problem when there is the possibility of a shift between historical and future environments, \emph{e.g.} due to unmeasured confounding, distributional shift, or an adversarial environment. We propose a perturbation model that allows changes in the transition kernel densities up to a given multiplicative factor or its reciprocal, extending the classic marginal sensitivity model (MSM) for single time-step decision-making to infinite-horizon RL. We characterize the sharp bounds on policy value under this model -- \emph{i.e.}, the tightest possible bounds based on transition observations from the original MDP -- and we study the estimation of these bounds from such transition observations. We develop an estimator with several important guarantees: it is semiparametrically efficient, and remains so even when certain necessary nuisance functions, such as worst-case Q-functions, are estimated at slow, nonparametric rates. Our estimator is also asymptotically normal, enabling straightforward statistical inference using Wald confidence intervals. Moreover, when certain nuisances are estimated inconsistently, the estimator still provides valid, albeit possibly not sharp, bounds on the policy value. We validate these properties in numerical simulations. The combination of accounting for environment shifts from train to test (robustness), being insensitive to nuisance-function estimation (orthogonality), and addressing the challenge of learning from finite samples (inference) together leads to credible and reliable policy evaluation."
Poster,Efficient Availability Attacks against Supervised and Contrastive Learning Simultaneously,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95958,"Yihan Wang, Yifan Zhu, Xiao-Shan Gao","Availability attacks provide a tool to prevent the unauthorized use of private data and commercial datasets by generating imperceptible noise and crafting unlearnable examples before release. Ideally, the obtained unlearnability can prevent algorithms from training usable models. When supervised learning (SL) algorithms have failed, a malicious data collector possibly resorts to contrastive learning (CL) algorithms to bypass the protection.Through evaluation, we have found that most existing methods are unable to achieve both supervised and contrastive unlearnability, which poses risks to data protection by availability attacks.Different from recent methods based on contrastive learning, we employ contrastive-like data augmentations in supervised learning frameworks to obtain attacks effective for both SL and CL.Our proposed AUE and AAP attacks achieve state-of-the-art worst-case unlearnability across SL and CL algorithms with less computation consumption, showcasing prospects in real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/EhanW/AUE-AAP."
Poster,EfficientCAPER: An End-to-End Framework for Fast and Robust Category-Level Articulated Object Pose Estimation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95615,"Xinyi Yu, Haonan Jiang, Li Zhang, Lin Yuanbo Wu, Linlin Ou, Liu Liu","Human life is populated with articulated objects. Pose estimation for category-level articulated objects is a significant challenge due to their inherent complexity and diverse kinematic structures. Current methods for this task usually meet the problems of insufficient consideration of kinematic constraints, self-occlusion, and optimization requirements. In this paper, we propose EfficientCAPER, an end-to-end Category-level Articulated object Pose EstimatoR, eliminating the need for optimization functions as post-processing and utilizing the kinematic structure for joint-centric pose modeling, thus enhancing the efficiency and applicability. Given a partial point cloud as input, the EfficientCAPER firstly estimates the pose for the free part of an articulated object using decoupled rotation representation. Next, we canonicalize the input point cloud to estimate constrained parts' poses by predicting the joint parameters and states as replacements. Evaluations on three diverse datasets, ArtImage, ReArtMix, and RobotArm, show EfficientCAPER's effectiveness and generalization ability to real-world scenarios. The framework exhibits excellent static pose estimation performance for articulated objects, contributing to the advancement of category-level pose estimation. Codes will be made publicly available."
Poster,Efficient Centroid-Linkage Clustering,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96585,"Mohammadhossein Bateni, Laxman Dhulipala, Willem Fletcher, Kishen N. Gowda, D Ellis Hershkowitz, Rajesh Jayaram, Jakub Lacki","We give an algorithm for Centroid-Linkage Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC), which computes a $c$-approximate clustering in roughly $n^{1+O(1/c^2)}$ time. We obtain our result by combining a new centroid-linkage HAC algorithm with a novel fully dynamic data structure for nearest neighbor search which works under adaptive updates.We also evaluate our algorithm empirically. By leveraging a state-of-the-art nearest-neighbor search library, we obtain a fast and accurate centroid-linkage HAC algorithm. Compared to an existing state-of-the-art exact baseline, our implementation maintains the clustering quality while delivering up to a $36\times$ speedup due to performing fewer distance comparisons."
Poster,Efficient Combinatorial Optimization via Heat Diffusion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93524,"Hengyuan Ma, Wenlian Lu, Jianfeng Feng","Combinatorial optimization problems are widespread but inherently challenging due to their discrete nature. The primary limitation of existing methods is that they can only access a small fraction of the solution space at each iteration, resulting in limited efficiency for searching the global optimal. To overcome this challenge, diverging from conventional efforts of expanding the solver's search scope, we focus on enabling information to actively propagate to the solver through heat diffusion. By transforming the target function while preserving its optima, heat diffusion facilitates information flow from distant regions to the solver, providing more efficient navigation. Utilizing heat diffusion, we propose a framework for solving general combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed methodology demonstrates superior performance across a range of the most challenging and widely encountered combinatorial optimizations. Echoing recent advancements in harnessing thermodynamics for generative artificial intelligence, our study further reveals its significant potential in advancing combinatorial optimization."
Poster,Efficient Contextual LLM Cascades through Budget-Constrained Policy Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94574,"Xuechen Zhang, Zijian Huang, Ege Onur Taga, Carlee Joe-Wong, Samet Oymak, Jiasi Chen","Recent successes in natural language processing have led to the proliferation of large language models (LLMs) by multiple providers. Each LLM offering has different inference accuracy, monetary cost, and latency, and their accuracy further depends on the exact wording of the question (i.e., the specific prompt). At the same time, users often have a limit on monetary budget and latency to answer all their questions, and they do not know which LLMs to choose for each question to meet their accuracy and long term budget requirements. To navigate this rich design space, we propose TREACLE (Thrifty Reasoning via Context-Aware LLM and Prompt Selection), a reinforcement learning policy that jointly selects the model and prompting scheme while respecting the user's monetary cost and latency constraints. TREACLE uses the problem context, including question text embeddings (reflecting the type or difficulty of a query) and the response history (reflecting the consistency of previous responses) to make smart decisions. Our evaluations on standard reasoning datasets (GSM8K, CSQA, and LLC) with various LLMs and prompts show that TREACLE enables cost savings of up to 85% compared to baselines, while maintaining high accuracy. Importantly, it provides the user with the ability to gracefully trade off accuracy for cost."
Poster,Efficient Convex Algorithms for Universal Kernel Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/98322,"Aleksandr Talitckii, Brendon Colbert, Matthew Peet","The accuracy and complexity of machine learning algorithms based on kernel optimization are determined by the set of kernels over which they are able to optimize. An ideal set of kernels should: admit a linear parameterization (for tractability); be dense in the set of all kernels (for robustness); be universal (for accuracy). Recently, a framework was proposed for using positive matrices to parameterize a class of positive semi-separable kernels. Although this class can be shown to meet all three criteria, previous algorithms for optimization of such kernels were limited to classification and furthermore relied on computationally complex Semidefinite Programming (SDP) algorithms. In this paper, we pose the problem of learning semiseparable kernels as a minimax optimization problem and propose a SVD-QCQP primal-dual algorithm which dramatically reduces the computational complexity as compared with previous SDP-based approaches. Furthermore, we provide an efficient implementation of this algorithm for both classification and regression -- an implementation which enables us to solve problems with 100 features and up to 30,000 datums. Finally, when applied to benchmark data, the algorithm demonstrates the potential for significant improvement in accuracy over typical (but non-convex) approaches such as Neural Nets and Random Forest with similar or better computation time."
Poster,Efficient Discrepancy Testing for Learning with Distribution Shift,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93605,"Gautam Chandrasekaran, Adam Klivans, Vasilis Kontonis, Konstantinos Stavropoulos, Arsen Vasilyan","A fundamental notion of distance between train and test distributions from the field of domain adaptation is discrepancy distance. While in general hard to compute, here we provide the first set of provably efficient algorithms for testing *localized* discrepancy distance, where discrepancy is computed with respect to a fixed output classifier.  These results imply a broad set of new, efficient learning algorithms in the recently introduced model of Testable Learning with Distribution Shift (TDS learning) due to Klivans et al. (2023).Our approach generalizes and improves all prior work on TDS learning: (1) we obtain *universal* learners that succeed simultaneously for large classes of test distributions, (2) achieve near-optimal error rates, and (3) give exponential improvements for constant depth circuits. Our methods further extend to semi-parametric settings and imply the first positive results for low-dimensional convex sets. Additionally, we separate learning and testing phases and obtain algorithms that run in fully polynomial time at test time."
