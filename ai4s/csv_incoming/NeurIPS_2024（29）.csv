Poster,An Expectation-Maximization Algorithm for Training Clean Diffusion Models from Corrupted Observations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93958,"Weimin Bai, Yifei Wang, Wenzheng Chen, He Sun","Diffusion models excel in solving imaging inverse problems due to their ability to model complex image priors. However, their reliance on large, clean datasets for training limits their practical use where clean data is scarce. In this paper, we propose EMDiffusion, an expectation-maximization (EM) approach to train diffusion models from corrupted observations. Our method alternates between reconstructing clean images from corrupted data using a known diffusion model (E-step) and refining diffusion model weights based on these reconstructions (M-step). This iterative process leads the learned diffusion model to gradually converge to a local optimum, that is, to approximate the true clean data distribution. We validate our method through extensive experiments on diverse computational imaging tasks, including random inpainting, denoising, and deblurring, achieving new state-of-the-art performance."
Poster,An eye for an ear: zero-shot audio description leveraging an image captioner with audio-visual token distribution matching,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94989,"Hugo Malard, Michel Olvera, Stéphane Lathuilière, Slim Essid","Multimodal large language models have fueled progress in image captioning. These models, fine-tuned on vast image datasets, exhibit a deep understanding of semantic concepts.In this work, we show that this ability can be re-purposed for audio captioning, where the joint image-language decoder can be leveraged to describe auditory content associated with image sequences within videos featuring audiovisual content. This can be achieved via multimodal alignment.Yet, this multimodal alignment task is non-trivial due to the inherent disparity between audible and visible elements in real-world videos. Moreover, multimodal representation learning often relies on contrastive learning, facing the challenge of the so-called modality gap which hinders smooth integration between modalities. In this work, we introduce a novel methodology for bridging the audiovisual modality gap by matching the distributions of tokens produced by an audio backbone and those of an image captioner. Our approach aligns the audio token distribution with that of the image tokens, enabling the model to perform zero-shot audio captioning in an unsupervised fashion. This alignment allows for the use of either audio or audiovisual input by combining or substituting the image encoder with the aligned audio encoder. Our method achieves significantly improved performances in zero-shot audio captioning, compared to existing approaches."
Poster,An Image is Worth 32 Tokens for Reconstruction and Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93338,"Qihang Yu, Mark Weber, Xueqing Deng, Xiaohui Shen, Daniel Cremers, Liang-Chieh Chen","Recent advancements in generative models have highlighted the crucial role of image tokenization in the efficient synthesis of high-resolution images. Tokenization, which transforms images into latent representations, reduces computational demands compared to directly processing pixels and enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of the generation process. Prior methods, such as VQGAN, typically utilize 2D latent grids with fixed downsampling factors. However, these 2D tokenizations face challenges in managing the inherent redundancies present in images, where adjacent regions frequently display similarities. To overcome this issue, we introduce **T**ransformer-based 1-D**i**mensional **Tok**enizer (TiTok), an innovative approach that tokenizes images into 1D latent sequences. TiTok provides a more compact latent representation, yielding substantially more efficient and effective representations than conventional techniques. For example, a 256 × 256 × 3 image can be reduced to just **32** discrete tokens, a significant reduction from the 256 or 1024 tokens obtained by prior methods. Despite its compact nature, TiTok achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, using the same generator framework, TiTok attains **1.97** gFID, outperforming MaskGIT baseline significantly by 4.21 at ImageNet 256 × 256 benchmark. The advantages of TiTok become even more significant when it comes to higher resolution. At ImageNet 512 × 512 benchmark, TiTok not only outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion model DiT-XL/2 (gFID 2.74 vs. 3.04), but also reduces the image tokens by 64×, leading to **410× faster** generation process. Our best-performing variant can significantly surpasses DiT-XL/2 (gFID **2.13** vs. 3.04) while still generating high-quality samples **74× faster**.

Poster,Animal-Bench: Benchmarking Multimodal Video Models for Animal-centric Video Understanding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96080,"Yinuo Jing, Ruxu Zhang, Kongming Liang, Yongxiang Li, Zhongjiang He, Zhanyu Ma, Jun Guo","With the emergence of large pre-trained multimodal video models, multiple benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate model capabilities. However, most of the benchmarks are human-centric, with evaluation data and tasks centered around human applications. Animals are an integral part of the natural world, and animal-centric video understanding is crucial for animal welfare and conservation efforts. Yet, existing benchmarks overlook evaluations focused on animals, limiting the application of the models. To address this limitation, our work established an animal-centric benchmark, namely Animal-Bench, to allow for a comprehensive evaluation of model capabilities in real-world contexts, overcoming agent-bias in previous benchmarks. Animal-Bench includes 13 tasks encompassing both common tasks shared with humans and special tasks relevant to animal conservation, spanning 7 major animal categories and 819 species, comprising a total of 41,839 data entries. To generate this benchmark, we defined a task system centered on animals and proposed an automated pipeline for animal-centric data processing. To further validate the robustness of models against real-world challenges, we utilized a video editing approach to simulate realistic scenarios like weather changes and shooting parameters due to animal movements. We evaluated 8 current multimodal video models on our benchmark and found considerable room for improvement. We hope our work provides insights for the community and opens up new avenues for research in multimodal video models. Our data and code will be released at https://github.com/PRIS-CV/Animal-Bench."
Poster,Animate3D: Animating Any 3D Model with Multi-view Video Diffusion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95850,"Yanqin Jiang, Chaohui Yu, Chenjie Cao, Fan Wang, Weiming Hu, Jin Gao","Recent advances in 4D generation mainly focus on generating 4D content by distilling pre-trained text or single-view image conditioned models. It is inconvenient for them to take advantage of various off-the-shelf 3D assets with multi-view attributes, and their results suffer from spatiotemporal inconsistency owing to the inherent ambiguity in the supervision signals. In this work, we present Animate3D, a novel framework for animating any static 3D model. The core idea is two-fold: 1) We propose a novel multi-view video diffusion model (MV-VDM) conditioned on multi-view renderings of the static 3D object, which is trained on our presented large-scale multi-view video dataset (MV-Video). 2) Based on MV-VDM, we introduce a framework combining reconstruction and 4D Score Distillation Sampling (4D-SDS) to leverage the multi-view video diffusion priors for animating 3D objects. Specifically, for MV-VDM, we design a new spatiotemporal attention module to enhance spatial and temporal consistency by integrating 3D and video diffusion models. Additionally, we leverage the static 3D model’s multi-view renderings as conditions to preserve its identity. For animating 3D models, an effective two-stage pipeline is proposed: we first reconstruct coarse motions directly from generated multi-view videos, followed by the introduced 4D-SDS to model fine-level motions. Benefiting from accurate motion learning, we could achieve straightforward mesh animation. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that Animate3D significantly outperforms previous approaches. Data, code, and models are open-released."
Poster,An Improved Empirical Fisher Approximation for Natural Gradient Descent,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95572,"Xiaodong Wu, Wenyi Yu, Chao Zhang, Phil Woodland","Approximate Natural Gradient Descent (NGD) methods are an important family of optimisers for deep learning models, which use approximate Fisher information matrices to pre-condition gradients during training. The empirical Fisher (EF) method approximates the Fisher information matrix empirically by reusing the per-sample gradients collected during back-propagation. Despite its ease of implementation, the EF approximation has its theoretical and practical limitations. This paper investigates the *inversely-scaled projection* issue of EF, which is shown to be a major cause of its poor empirical approximation quality. An improved empirical Fisher (iEF) method is proposed to address this issue, which is motivated as a generalised NGD method from a loss reduction perspective, meanwhile retaining the practical convenience of EF. The exact iEF and EF methods are experimentally evaluated using practical deep learning setups, including widely-used setups for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained models (T5-base with LoRA and Prompt-Tuning on GLUE tasks, and ViT with LoRA for CIFAR100). Optimisation experiments show that applying exact iEF directly as an optimiser provides strong convergence and generalisation. It achieves the best test performance and the lowest training loss for the majority of the tasks, even when compared to well-tuned AdamW/Adafactor baselines. Additionally, under a novel empirical evaluation framework, the proposed iEF method shows consistently better approximation quality to exact Natural Gradient updates than both the EF and the more expensive sampled Fisher methods, meanwhile demonstrating the superior property of being robust to the choice of damping across tasks and training stages. Improving existing approximate NGD optimisers with iEF is expected to lead to better convergence and robustness. Furthermore, the iEF method also serves as a better approximation method to the Fisher information matrix itself, which enables the improvement of a variety of Fisher-based methods, not limited to the scope of optimisation."
Poster,An In-depth Investigation of Sparse Rate Reduction in Transformer-like Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96159,"Yunzhe Hu, Difan Zou, Dong Xu","Deep neural networks have long been criticized for being black-box. To unveil the inner workings of modern neural architectures, a recent work proposed an information-theoretic objective function called Sparse Rate Reduction (SRR) and interpreted its unrolled optimization as a Transformer-like model called Coding Rate Reduction Transformer (CRATE). However, the focus of the study was primarily on the basic implementation, and whether this objective is optimized in practice and its causal relationship to generalization remain elusive. Going beyond this study, we derive different implementations by analyzing layer-wise behaviors of CRATE, both theoretically and empirically. To reveal the predictive power of SRR on generalization, we collect a set of model variants induced by varied implementations and hyperparameters and evaluate SRR as a complexity measure based on its correlation with generalization. Surprisingly, we find out that SRR has a positive correlation coefficient and outperforms other baseline measures, such as path-norm and sharpness-based ones. Furthermore, we show that generalization can be improved using SRR as regularization on benchmark image classification datasets. We hope this paper can shed light on leveraging SRR to design principled models and study their generalization ability."
Poster,An Information Theoretic Perspective on Conformal Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94151,"Alvaro Correia, Fabio Valerio Massoli, Christos Louizos, Arash Behboodi","Conformal Prediction (CP) is a distribution-free uncertainty estimation framework that constructs prediction sets guaranteed to contain the true answer with a user-specified probability. Intuitively, the size of the prediction set encodes a general notion of uncertainty, with larger sets associated with higher degrees of uncertainty. In this work, we leverage information theory to connect conformal prediction to other notions of uncertainty. More precisely, we prove three different ways to upper bound the intrinsic uncertainty, as described by the conditional entropy of the target variable given the inputs, by combining CP with information theoretical inequalities. Moreover, we demonstrate two direct and useful applications of such connection between conformal prediction and information theory: (i) more principled and effective conformal training objectives that generalize previous approaches and enable end-to-end training of machine learning models from scratch, and (ii) a natural mechanism to incorporate side information into conformal prediction. We empirically validate both applications in centralized and federated learning settings, showing our theoretical results translate to lower inefficiency (average prediction set size) for popular CP methods."
Poster,Annealed Multiple Choice Learning: Overcoming limitations of Winner-takes-all with annealing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94844,"David Perera, Victor Letzelter, Theo Mariotte, Adrien Cortes, Mickael Chen, Slim Essid, Gaël Richard","We introduce Annealed Multiple Choice Learning (aMCL) which combines simulated annealing with MCL. MCL is a learning framework handling ambiguous tasks by predicting a small set of plausible hypotheses. These hypotheses are trained using the Winner-takes-all (WTA) scheme, which promotes the diversity of the predictions. However, this scheme may converge toward an arbitrarily suboptimal local minimum, due to the greedy nature of WTA. We overcome this limitation using annealing, which enhances the exploration of the hypothesis space during training. We leverage insights from statistical physics and information theory to provide a detailed description of the model training trajectory. Additionally, we validate our algorithm by extensive experiments on synthetic datasets, on the standard UCI benchmark, and on speech separation."
Poster,An Offline Adaptation Framework for Constrained Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95257,"Qian Lin, Zongkai Liu, Danying Mo, Chao Yu","In recent years, significant progress has been made in multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL) research, which aims to balance multiple objectives by incorporating preferences for each objective. In most existing studies, specific preferences must be provided during deployment to indicate the desired policies explicitly. However, designing these preferences depends heavily on human prior knowledge, which is typically obtained through extensive observation of high-performing demonstrations with expected behaviors. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective offline adaptation framework for multi-objective RL problems without assuming handcrafted target preferences, but only given several demonstrations to implicitly indicate the preferences of expected policies. Additionally, we demonstrate that our framework can naturally be extended to meet constraints on safety-critical objectives by utilizing safe demonstrations, even when the safety thresholds are unknown. Empirical results on offline multi-objective and safe tasks demonstrate the capability of our framework to infer policies that align with real preferences while meeting the constraints implied by the provided demonstrations."
