Poster,Convergence Analysis of Split Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93262,"Pengchao Han, Chao Huang, Geng Tian, Ming Tang, Xin Liu","Split federated learning (SFL) is a recent distributed approach for collaborative model training among multiple clients. In SFL, a global model is typically split into two parts, where clients train one part in a parallel federated manner, and a main server trains the other. Despite the recent research on SFL algorithm development, the convergence analysis of SFL is missing in the literature, and this paper aims to fill this gap. The analysis of SFL can be more challenging than that of federated learning (FL), due to the potential dual-paced updates at the clients and the main server. We provide convergence analysis of SFL for strongly convex and general convex objectives on heterogeneous data. The convergence rates are $O(1/T)$ and $O(1/\sqrt[3]{T})$, respectively, where $T$ denotes the total number of rounds for SFL training. We further extend the analysis to non-convex objectives and where some clients may be unavailable during training. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical results and show that SFL outperforms FL and split learning (SL) when data is highly heterogeneous across a large number of clients."
Poster,Convergence of $\text{log}(1/\epsilon)$ for Gradient-Based Algorithms in Zero-Sum Games without the Condition Number: A Smoothed Analysis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94042,"Ioannis Anagnostides, Tuomas Sandholm","Gradient-based algorithms have shown great promise in solving large (two-player) zero-sum games. However, their success has been mostly confined to the low-precision regime since the number of iterations grows polynomially in $1/\epsilon$, where $\epsilon > 0$ is the duality gap. While it has been well-documented that linear convergence---an iteration complexity scaling as $\text{log}(1/\epsilon)$---can be attained even with gradient-based algorithms, that comes at the cost of introducing a dependency on certain condition number-like quantities which can be exponentially large in the description of the game. To address this shortcoming, we examine the iteration complexity of several gradient-based algorithms in the celebrated framework of smoothed analysis, and we show that they have polynomial smoothed complexity, in that their number of iterations grows as a polynomial in the dimensions of the game, $\text{log}(1/\epsilon)$, and $1/\sigma$, where $\sigma$ measures the magnitude of the smoothing perturbation. Our result applies to optimistic gradient and extra-gradient descent/ascent, as well as a certain iterative variant of Nesterov's smoothing technique. From a technical standpoint, the proof proceeds by characterizing and performing a smoothed analysis of a certain error bound, the key ingredient driving linear convergence in zero-sum games. En route, our characterization also makes a natural connection between the convergence rate of such algorithms and perturbation-stability properties of the equilibrium, which is of interest beyond the model of smoothed complexity."
Poster,Convergence of No-Swap-Regret Dynamics in Self-Play,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96155,"Renato Leme, Georgios Piliouras, Jon Schneider","In this paper, we investigate the question of whether no-swap-regret dynamics have stronger convergence properties in repeated games than regular no-external-regret dynamics. We prove that in almost all symmetric zero-sum games under symmetric initializations of the agents, no-swap-regret dynamics in self-play are guaranteed to converge in a strong ``frequent-iterate'' sense to the Nash equilibrium: in all but a vanishing fraction of the rounds, the players must play a strategy profile close to a symmetric Nash equilibrium.  Remarkably, relaxing any of these three constraints, i.e. by allowing either i) asymmetric initial conditions, or ii) an asymmetric game or iii) no-external regret dynamics suffices to destroy this result and lead to complex non-equilibrating or even chaotic behavior. In a dual type of result, we show that the power of no-swap-regret dynamics comes at a cost of imposing a time-asymmetry on its inputs. While no-external-regret dynamics can be completely determined by the cumulative reward vector received by each player, we show there does not exist any general no-swap-regret dynamics defined on the same state space. In fact, we prove that any no-swap-regret learning algorithm must play a time-asymmetric function over the set of previously observed rewards, ruling out any dynamics based on a symmetric function of the current set of rewards."
Poster,Convolutional Differentiable Logic Gate Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96650,"Felix Petersen, Hilde Kuehne, Christian Borgelt, Julian Welzel, Stefano Ermon","With the increasing inference cost of machine learning models, there is a growing interest in models with fast and efficient inference. Recently, an approach for learning logic gate networks directly via a differentiable relaxation was proposed. Logic gate networks are faster than conventional neural network approaches because their inference only requires logic gate operators such as NAND, OR, and XOR, which are the underlying building blocks of current hardware and can be efficiently executed. We build on this idea, extending it by deep logic gate tree convolutions, logical OR pooling, and residual initializations. This allows scaling logic gate networks up by over one order of magnitude and utilizing the paradigm of convolution. On CIFAR-10, we achieve an accuracy of 86.29% using only 61 million logic gates, which improves over the SOTA while being 29x smaller."
Poster,Convolutions and More as Einsum: A Tensor Network Perspective with Advances for Second-Order Methods,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94434,Felix Dangel,"Despite their simple intuition, convolutions are more tedious to analyze than dense layers, which complicates the transfer of theoretical and algorithmic ideas to convolutions. We simplify convolutions by viewing them as tensor networks (TNs) that allow reasoning about the underlying tensor multiplications by drawing diagrams, manipulating them to perform function transformations like differentiation, and efficiently evaluating them with `einsum`. To demonstrate their simplicity and expressiveness, we derive diagrams of various autodiff operations and popular curvature approximations with full hyper-parameter support, batching, channel groups, and generalization to any convolution dimension. Further, we provide convolution-specific transformations based on the connectivity pattern which allow to simplify diagrams before evaluation. Finally, we probe performance. Our TN implementation accelerates a recently-proposed KFAC variant up to 4.5 x while removing the standard implementation's memory overhead, and enables new hardware-efficient tensor dropout for approximate backpropagation."
Poster,Co-occurrence is not Factual Association in Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93076,"Xiao Zhang, Miao Li, Ji Wu","Pretrained language models can encode a large amount of knowledge and utilize it for various reasoning tasks, yet they can still struggle to learn novel factual knowledge effectively from finetuning on limited textual demonstrations. In this work, we show that the reason for this deficiency is that language models are biased to learn word co-occurrence statistics instead of true factual associations. We identify the differences between two forms of knowledge representation in language models: knowledge in the form of co-occurrence statistics is encoded in the middle layers of the transformer model and does not generalize well to reasoning scenarios beyond simple question answering, while true factual associations are encoded in the lower layers and can be freely utilized in various reasoning tasks. Based on these observations, we propose two strategies to improve the learning of factual associations in language models. We show that training on text with implicit rather than explicit factual associations can force the model to learn factual associations instead of co-occurrence statistics, significantly improving the generalization of newly learned knowledge. We also propose a simple training method to actively forget the learned co-occurrence statistics, which unblocks and enhances the learning of factual associations when training on plain narrative text. On both synthetic and real-world corpora, the two proposed strategies improve the generalization of the knowledge learned during finetuning to reasoning scenarios such as indirect and multi-hop question answering."
Poster,CooHOI: Learning Cooperative Human-Object Interaction with Manipulated Object Dynamics,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93997,"Jiawei Gao, Ziqin Wang, Zeqi Xiao, Jingbo Wang, Tai WANG, Jinkun Cao, Xiaolin Hu, Si Liu, Jifeng Dai, Jiangmiao Pang","Enabling humanoid robots to clean rooms has long been a pursued dream within humanoid research communities. However, many tasks require multi-humanoid collaboration, such as carrying large and heavy furniture together. Given the scarcity of motion capture data on multi-humanoid collaboration and the efficiency challenges associated with multi-agent learning, these tasks cannot be straightforwardly addressed using training paradigms designed for single-agent scenarios. In this paper, we introduce **Coo**perative **H**uman-**O**bject **I**nteraction (**CooHOI**), a framework designed to tackle the challenge of multi-humanoid object transportation problem through a two-phase learning paradigm: individual skill learning and subsequent policy transfer. First, a single humanoid character learns to interact with objects through imitation learning from human motion priors. Then, the humanoid learns to collaborate with others by considering the shared dynamics of the manipulated object using centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent RL algorithms. When one agent interacts with the object, resulting in specific object dynamics changes, the other agents learn to respond appropriately, thereby achieving implicit communication and coordination between teammates. Unlike previous approaches that relied on tracking-based methods for multi-humanoid HOI, CooHOI is inherently efficient, does not depend on motion capture data of multi-humanoid interactions, and can be seamlessly extended to include more participants and a wide range of object types."
Poster,Cooperate or Collapse:  Emergence of Sustainable Cooperation in a Society of LLM Agents,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96895,"Giorgio Piatti, Zhijing Jin, Max Kleiman-Weiner, Bernhard Schölkopf, Mrinmaya Sachan, Rada Mihalcea","As AI systems pervade human life, ensuring that large language models (LLMs) make safe decisions remains a significant challenge. We introduce the Governance of the Commons Simulation (GovSim), a generative simulation platform designed to study strategic interactions and cooperative decision-making in LLMs. In GovSim, a society of AI agents must collectively balance exploiting a common resource with sustaining it for future use. This environment enables the study of how ethical considerations, strategic planning, and negotiation skills impact cooperative outcomes. We develop an LLM-based agent architecture and test it with the leading open and closed LLMs. We find that all but the most powerful LLM agents fail to achieve a sustainable equilibrium in GovSim, with the highest survival rate below 54%. Ablations reveal that successful multi-agent communication between agents is critical for achieving cooperation in these cases. Furthermore, our analyses show that the failure to achieve sustainable cooperation in most LLMs stems from their inability to formulate and analyze hypotheses about the long-term effects of their actions on the equilibrium of the group. Finally, we show that agents that leverage ""Universalization""-based reasoning, a theory of moral thinking, are able to achieve significantly better sustainability. Taken together, GovSim enables us to study the mechanisms that underlie sustainable self-government with specificity and scale. We open source the full suite of our research results, including the simulation environment, agent prompts, and a comprehensive web interface."
Poster,"Cooperation, Competition, and Maliciousness: LLM-Stakeholders Interactive Negotiation",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97850,"Sahar Abdelnabi, Amr Gomaa, Sarath Sivaprasad, Lea Schönherr, Mario Fritz","There is a growing interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems to tackle interactive real-world tasks that require effective collaboration and assessing complex situations. Yet, we have a limited understanding of LLMs' communication and decision-making abilities in multi-agent setups. The fundamental task of negotiation spans many key features of communication, such as cooperation, competition, and manipulation potentials. Thus, we propose using scorable negotiation to evaluate LLMs. We create a testbed of complex multi-agent, multi-issue, and semantically rich negotiation games. To reach an agreement, agents must have strong arithmetic, inference, exploration, and planning capabilities while integrating them in a dynamic and multi-turn setup. We propose metrics to rigorously quantify agents' performance and alignment with the assigned role. We provide procedures to create new games and increase games' difficulty to have an evolving benchmark. Importantly, we evaluate critical safety aspects such as the interaction dynamics between agents influenced by greedy and adversarial players. Our benchmark is highly challenging; GPT-3.5 and small models mostly fail, and GPT-4 and SoTA large models (e.g., Llama-3 70b) still underperform in reaching agreement in non-cooperative and more difficult games."
Poster,Cooperative Hardware-Prompt Learning for Snapshot Compressive Imaging,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92924,"JIAMIAN WANG, Zongliang Wu, Yulun Zhang, Xin Yuan, Tao Lin, Zhiqiang Tao","Existing reconstruction models in snapshot compressive imaging systems (SCI) are trained with a single well-calibrated hardware instance, making their perfor- mance vulnerable to hardware shifts and limited in adapting to multiple hardware configurations. To facilitate cross-hardware learning, previous efforts attempt to directly collect multi-hardware data and perform centralized training, which is impractical due to severe user data privacy concerns and hardware heterogeneity across different platforms/institutions. In this study, we explicitly consider data privacy and heterogeneity in cooperatively optimizing SCI systems by proposing a Federated Hardware-Prompt learning (FedHP) framework. Rather than mitigating the client drift by rectifying the gradients, which only takes effect on the learning manifold but fails to solve the heterogeneity rooted in the input data space, FedHP learns a hardware-conditioned prompter to align inconsistent data distribution across clients, serving as an indicator of the data inconsistency among different hardware (e.g., coded apertures). Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FedHP coordinates the pre-trained model to multiple hardware con- figurations, outperforming prevalent FL frameworks for 0.35dB under challenging heterogeneous settings. Moreover, a Snapshot Spectral Heterogeneous Dataset has been built upon multiple practical SCI systems. Data and code are aveilable at https://github.com/Jiamian-Wang/FedHP-Snapshot-Compressive-Imaging.git"
