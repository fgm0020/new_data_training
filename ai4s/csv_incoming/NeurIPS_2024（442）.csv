Poster,VLKEB: A Large Vision-Language Model Knowledge Editing Benchmark,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97679,"Han Huang, Haitian Zhong, Tao Yu, Qiang Liu, Shu Wu, Liang Wang, Tieniu Tan","Recently, knowledge editing on large language models (LLMs) has received considerable attention. Compared to this, editing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) faces extra challenges from diverse data modalities and complicated model components, and data for LVLMs editing are limited. The existing LVLM editing benchmark, which comprises three metrics (Reliability, Locality, and Generality), falls short in the quality of synthesized evaluation images and cannot assess whether models apply edited knowledge in relevant content. Therefore, we employ more reliable data collection methods to construct a new Large $\textbf{V}$ision-$\textbf{L}$anguage Model $\textbf{K}$nowledge $\textbf{E}$diting $\textbf{B}$enchmark, $\textbf{VLKEB}$, and extend the Portability metric for more comprehensive evaluation. Leveraging a multi-modal knowledge graph, our image data are bound with knowledge entities. This can be further used to extract entity-related knowledge, which constitutes the base of editing data. We conduct experiments of different editing methods on five LVLMs, and thoroughly analyze how do they impact the models. The results reveal strengths and deficiencies of these methods and hopefully provide insights for future research. The codes and dataset are available at: https://github.com/VLKEB/VLKEB."
Poster,VLM4Bio: A Benchmark Dataset to Evaluate Pretrained Vision-Language Models for Trait Discovery from Biological Images,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97668,"M. Maruf, Arka Daw, Kazi Sajeed Mehrab, Harish Babu Manogaran, Abhilash Neog, Medha Sawhney, Mridul Khurana, James Balhoff, Yasin Bakis, Bahadir Altintas, Matthew Thompson, Elizabeth Campolongo, Josef Uyeda, Hilmar Lapp, Henry Bart, Paula Mabee, Yu Su, Wei-Lun (Harry) Chao, Charles Stewart, Tanya Berger-Wolf, Wasila Dahdul, Anuj Karpatne","Images are increasingly becoming the currency for documenting biodiversity on the planet, providing novel opportunities for accelerating scientific discoveries in the field of organismal biology, especially with the advent of large vision-language models (VLMs). We ask if pre-trained VLMs can aid scientists in answering a range of biologically relevant questions without any additional fine-tuning. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of $12$ state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs in the field of organismal biology using a novel dataset, VLM4Bio, consisting of $469K$ question-answer pairs involving $30K$ images from three groups of organisms: fishes, birds, and butterflies, covering five biologically relevant tasks. We also explore the effects of applying prompting techniques and tests for reasoning hallucination on the performance of VLMs, shedding new light on the capabilities of current SOTA VLMs in answering biologically relevant questions using images."
Poster,VLM Agents Generate Their Own Memories: Distilling Experience into Embodied Programs of Thought,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96600,"Gabriel Sarch, Lawrence Jang, Michael Tarr, William Cohen, Kenneth Marino, Katerina Fragkiadaki","Large-scale generative language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs) excel in few-shot in-context learning for decision making and instruction following. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a task demonstration that may contain inefficiencies or mistakes, a VLM abstracts the trajectory into a generalized program by correcting inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: causal relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task-relevant visual elements. These abstractions are iteratively improved and adapted through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting examples, when used as exemplars in the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Moreover, as the agent's library of examples grows, it becomes more efficient, relying less on human feedback and requiring fewer environment interactions per demonstration. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over the SOTA from 14.3% to 22.7% using GPT4V. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on manual prompt engineering and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such abstractions."
Poster,VLMimic: Vision Language Models are Visual Imitation Learner for Fine-grained Actions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96165,"Guangyan Chen, Meiling Wang, Te Cui, Yao Mu, Haoyang Lu, Tianxing Zhou, Zicai Peng, Mengxiao Hu, Haizhou Li, Li Yuan, Yi Yang, Yufeng Yue","Visual imitation learning (VIL) provides an efficient and intuitive strategy for robotic systems to acquire novel skills. Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in vision and language reasoning capabilities for VIL tasks. Despite the progress, current VIL methods naively employ VLMs to learn high-level plans from human videos, relying on pre-defined motion primitives for executing physical interactions, which remains a major bottleneck. In this work, we present VLMimic, a novel paradigm that harnesses VLMs to directly learn even fine-grained action levels, only given a limited number of human videos. Specifically, VLMimic first grounds object-centric movements from human videos, and learns skills using hierarchical constraint representations, facilitating the derivation of skills with fine-grained action levels from limited human videos. These skills are refined and updated through an iterative comparison strategy, enabling efficient adaptation to unseen environments. Our extensive experiments exhibit that our VLMimic, using only 5 human videos, yields significant improvements of over 27% and 21% in RLBench and real-world manipulation tasks, and surpasses baselines by more than 37% in long-horizon tasks.

Poster,VMamba: Visual State Space Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94617,"Yue Liu, Yunjie Tian, Yuzhong Zhao, Hongtian Yu, Lingxi Xie, Yaowei Wang, Qixiang Ye, Jianbin Jiao, Yunfan Liu","Designing computationally efficient network architectures remains an ongoing necessity in computer vision. In this paper, we adapt Mamba, a state-space language model, into VMamba, a vision backbone with linear time complexity. At the core of VMamba is a stack of Visual State-Space (VSS) blocks with the 2D Selective Scan (SS2D) module. By traversing along four scanning routes, SS2D bridges the gap between the ordered nature of 1D selective scan and the non-sequential structure of 2D vision data, which facilitates the collection of contextual information from various sources and perspectives. Based on the VSS blocks, we develop a family of VMamba architectures and accelerate them through a succession of architectural and implementation enhancements. Extensive experiments demonstrate VMamba’s promising performance across diverse visual perception tasks, highlighting its superior input scaling efficiency compared to existing benchmark models.

Poster,Vocal Call Locator Benchmark (VCL) for localizing rodent vocalizations from multi-channel audio,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97470,"Ralph Peterson, Aramis Tanelus, Christopher Ick, Bartul Mimica, Niegil Francis Muttath Joseph, Violet Ivan, Aman Choudhri, Annegret Falkner, Mala Murthy, David Schneider, Dan Sanes, Alex Williams","Understanding the behavioral and neural dynamics of social interactions is a goalof contemporary neuroscience. Many machine learning methods have emergedin recent years to make sense of complex video and neurophysiological data thatresult from these experiments. Less focus has been placed on understanding howanimals process acoustic information, including social vocalizations. A criticalstep to bridge this gap is determining the senders and receivers of acoustic infor-mation in social interactions. While sound source localization (SSL) is a classicproblem in signal processing, existing approaches are limited in their ability tolocalize animal-generated sounds in standard laboratory environments. Advancesin deep learning methods for SSL are likely to help address these limitations,however there are currently no publicly available models, datasets, or benchmarksto systematically evaluate SSL algorithms in the domain of bioacoustics. Here,we present the VCL Benchmark: the first large-scale dataset for benchmarkingSSL algorithms in rodents. We acquired synchronized video and multi-channelaudio recordings of 767,295 sounds with annotated ground truth sources across 9conditions. The dataset provides benchmarks which evaluate SSL performance onreal data, simulated acoustic data, and a mixture of real and simulated data. Weintend for this benchmark to facilitate knowledge transfer between the neuroscienceand acoustic machine learning communities, which have had limited overlap."
Poster,Voila-A: Aligning Vision-Language Models with User's Gaze Attention,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94630,"Kun Yan, Zeyu Wang, Lei Ji, Yuntao Wang, Nan Duan, Shuai Ma","In recent years, the integration of vision and language understanding has led to significant advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly through Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, existing VLMs face challenges in handling real-world applications with complex scenes and multiple objects, as well as aligning their focus with the diverse attention patterns of human users. In this paper, we introduce gaze information, feasibly collected by ubiquitous wearable devices such as MR glasses, as a proxy for human attention to guide VLMs. We propose a novel approach, Voila-A, for gaze alignment to enhance the effectiveness of these models in real-world applications. First, we collect hundreds of minutes of gaze data to demonstrate that we can mimic human gaze modalities using localized narratives. We then design an automatic data annotation pipeline utilizing GPT-4 to generate the VOILA-COCO dataset. Additionally, we introduce a new model VOILA-A that integrate gaze information into VLMs while maintain pretrained knowledge from webscale dataset. We evaluate Voila-A using a hold-out validation set and a newly collected VOILA-GAZE testset, which features real-life scenarios captured with a gaze-tracking device. Our experimental results demonstrate that Voila-A significantly outperforms several baseline models. By aligning model attention with human gaze patterns, Voila-A paves the way for more intuitive, user-centric VLMs and fosters engaging human-AI interaction across a wide range of applications."
Poster,Voxel Mamba: Group-Free State Space Models for Point Cloud based 3D Object Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94155,"Guowen Zhang, Lue Fan, Chenhang HE, Zhen Lei, ZHAO-XIANG ZHANG, Lei Zhang","Serialization-based methods, which serialize the 3D voxels and group them into multiple sequences before inputting to Transformers, have demonstrated their effectiveness in 3D object detection. However, serializing 3D voxels into 1D sequences will inevitably sacrifice the voxel spatial proximity. Such an issue is hard to be addressed by enlarging the group size with existing serialization-based methods due to the quadratic complexity of Transformers with feature sizes. Inspired by the recent advances of state space models (SSMs), we present a Voxel SSM, termed as Voxel Mamba, which employs a group-free strategy to serialize the whole space of voxels into a single sequence. The linear complexity of SSMs encourages our group-free design, alleviating the loss of spatial proximity of voxels. To further enhance the spatial proximity, we propose a Dual-scale SSM Block to establish a hierarchical structure, enabling a larger receptive field in the 1D serialization curve, as well as more complete local regions in 3D space. Moreover, we implicitly apply window partition under the group-free framework by positional encoding, which further enhances spatial proximity by encoding voxel positional information. Our experiments on Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes dataset show that Voxel Mamba not only achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, but also demonstrates significant advantages in computational efficiency.

Poster,Voxel Proposal Network via Multi-Frame Knowledge Distillation for Semantic Scene Completion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96957,"Lubo Wang, Di Lin, Kairui Yang, Ruonan Liu, Qing Guo, Wuyuan Xie, Miaohui Wang, Lingyu Liang, Yi Wang, Ping Li","Semantic scene completion is a difficult task that involves completing the geometry and semantics of a scene from point clouds in a large-scale environment. Many current methods use 3D/2D convolutions or attention mechanisms, but these have limitations in directly constructing geometry and accurately propagating features from related voxels, the completion likely fails while propagating features in a single pass without considering multiple potential pathways. And they are generally only suitable for static scenes and struggle to handle dynamic aspects. This paper introduces Voxel Proposal Network (VPNet) that completes scenes from 3D and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) perspectives. It includes Confident Voxel Proposal based on voxel-wise coordinates to propose confident voxels with high reliability for completion. This method reconstructs the scene geometry and implicitly models the uncertainty of voxel-wise semantic labels by presenting multiple possibilities for voxels. VPNet employs Multi-Frame Knowledge Distillation based on the point clouds of multiple adjacent frames to accurately predict the voxel-wise labels by condensing various possibilities of voxel relationships. VPNet has shown superior performance and achieved state-of-the-art results on the SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS datasets."
Poster,V-PETL Bench: A Unified Visual Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning Benchmark,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97434,"Yi Xin, Siqi Luo, Xuyang Liu, Yuntao Du., Haodi Zhou, Xinyu Cheng, Christina Lee, Junlong Du, Haozhe Wang, MingCai Chen, Ting Liu, Guimin Hu, Zhongwei Wan, rongchao zhang, Aoxue Li, Mingyang Yi, Xiaohong Liu","Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) methods show promise in adapting a pre-trained model to various downstream tasks while training only a few parameters. In the computer vision (CV) domain, numerous PETL algorithms have been proposed, but their direct employment or comparison remains inconvenient. To address this challenge, we construct a Unified Visual PETL Benchmark (V-PETL Bench) for the CV domain by selecting 30 diverse, challenging, and comprehensive datasets from image recognition, video action recognition, and dense prediction tasks. On these datasets, we systematically evaluate 25 dominant PETL algorithms and open-source a modular and extensible codebase for fair evaluation of these algorithms. V-PETL Bench runs on NVIDIA A800 GPUs and requires approximately 310 GPU days. We release all the benchmark, making it more efficient and friendly to researchers. Additionally, V-PETL Bench will be continuously updated for new PETL algorithms and CV tasks."
