Poster,AROMA: Preserving Spatial Structure for Latent PDE Modeling with Local Neural Fields,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96233,"Louis Serrano, Thomas X Wang, Etienne Le Naour, Jean-Noël Vittaut, Patrick Gallinari","We present AROMA (Attentive Reduced Order Model with Attention), a framework designed to enhance the modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs) using local neural fields. Our flexible encoder-decoder architecture can obtain smooth latent representations of spatial physical fields from a variety of data types, including irregular-grid inputs and point clouds. This versatility eliminates the need for patching and allows efficient processing of diverse geometries. The sequential nature of our latent representation can be interpreted spatially and permits the use of a conditional transformer for modeling the temporal dynamics of PDEs. By employing a diffusion-based formulation, we achieve greater stability and enable longer rollouts compared to conventional MSE training. AROMA's superior performance in simulating 1D and 2D equations underscores the efficacy of our approach in capturing complex dynamical behaviors."
Poster,AR-Pro: Counterfactual Explanations for Anomaly Repair with Formal Properties,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93784,"Xiayan Ji, Anton Xue, Eric Wong, Oleg Sokolsky, Insup Lee","Anomaly detection is widely used for identifying critical errors and suspicious behaviors, but current methods lack interpretability.We leverage common properties of existing methods and recent advances in generative models to introduce counterfactual explanations for anomaly detection.Given an input, we generate its counterfactual as a diffusion-based repair that shows what a non-anomalous version $\textit{should have looked like}$.A key advantage of this approach is that it enables a domain-independent formal specification of explainability desiderata, offering a unified framework for generating and evaluating explanations.We demonstrate the effectiveness of our anomaly explainability framework, AR-Pro, on vision (MVTec, VisA) and time-series (SWaT, WADI, HAI) anomaly datasets. The code used for the experiments is accessible at: https://github.com/xjiae/arpro."
Poster,ART: Automatic Red-teaming for Text-to-Image Models to Protect Benign Users,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95859,"Guanlin Li, Kangjie Chen, Shudong Zhang, Jie Zhang, Tianwei Zhang","Large-scale pre-trained generative models are taking the world by storm, due to their abilities in generating creative content. Meanwhile, safeguards for these generative models are developed, to protect users' rights and safety, most of which are designed for large language models. Existing methods primarily focus on jailbreak and adversarial attacks, which mainly evaluate the model's safety under malicious prompts. Recent work found that manually crafted safe prompts can unintentionally trigger unsafe generations. To further systematically evaluate the safety risks of text-to-image models, we propose a novel Automatic Red-Teaming framework, ART. Our method leverages both vision language model and large language model to establish a connection between unsafe generations and their prompts, thereby more efficiently identifying the model's vulnerabilities. With our comprehensive experiments, we reveal the toxicity of the popular open-source text-to-image models. The experiments also validate the effectiveness, adaptability, and great diversity of ART. Additionally, we introduce three large-scale red-teaming datasets for studying the safety risks associated with text-to-image models. Datasets and models can be found in https://github.com/GuanlinLee/ART."
Poster,Artemis:  Towards Referential Understanding in Complex Videos,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95960,"Jihao Qiu, Yuan Zhang, Xi Tang, Lingxi Xie, Tianren Ma, Pengyu Yan, DAVID DOERMANN, Qixiang Ye, Yunjie Tian","Videos carry rich visual information including object description, action, interaction, etc., but the existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) fell short in referential understanding scenarios such as video-based referring. In this paper, we present Artemis, an MLLM that pushes video-based referential understanding to a finer level. Given a video, Artemis receives a natural-language question with a bounding box in any video frame and describes the referred target in the entire video. The key to achieving this goal lies in extracting compact, target-specific video features, where we set a solid baseline by tracking and selecting spatiotemporal features from the video. We train Artemis on the newly established ViderRef45K dataset with 45K video-QA pairs and design a computationally efficient, three-stage training procedure. Results are promising both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally, we show that Artemis can be integrated with video grounding and text summarization tools to understand more complex scenarios. Code and data are available at https://github.com/NeurIPS24Artemis/Artemis."
Poster,Articulate your NeRF: Unsupervised articulated object modeling via conditional view synthesis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96321,"Jianning Deng, Kartic Subr, Hakan Bilen","We propose a novel unsupervised method to learn pose and part-segmentation of articulated objects with rigid parts.    Given two observations of an object in different articulation states, our method learns the geometry and appearance of object parts by using an implicit model from the first observation, distills the part segmentation and articulation from the second observation while rendering the latter observation.    Additionally, to tackle the complexities in the joint optimization of part segmentation and articulation, we propose a voxel grid based initialization strategy and a decoupled optimization procedure.    Compared to the prior unsupervised work, our model obtains significantly better performance, generalizes to objects with multiple parts while it can be efficiently from few views for the latter observation."
Poster,Artificial Generational Intelligence: Cultural Accumulation in Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93559,"Jonathan Cook, Chris Lu, Edward Hughes, Joel Leibo, Jakob Foerster","Cultural accumulation drives the open-ended and diverse progress in capabilities spanning human history. It builds an expanding body of knowledge and skills by combining individual exploration with inter-generational information transmission. Despite its widespread success among humans, the capacity for artificial learning agents to accumulate culture remains under-explored. In particular, approaches to reinforcement learning typically strive for improvements over only a single lifetime. Generational algorithms that do exist fail to capture the open-ended, emergent nature of cultural accumulation, which allows individuals to trade-off innovation and imitation. Building on the previously demonstrated ability for reinforcement learning agents to perform social learning, we find that training setups which balance this with independent learning give rise to cultural accumulation. These accumulating agents outperform those trained for a single lifetime with the same cumulative experience. We explore this accumulation by constructing two models under two distinct notions of a generation: episodic generations, in which accumulation occurs via in-context learning and train-time generations, in which accumulation occurs via in-weights learning. In-context and in-weights cultural accumulation can be interpreted as analogous to knowledge and skill accumulation, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to present general models that achieve emergent cultural accumulation in reinforcement learning, opening up new avenues towards more open-ended learning systems, as well as presenting new opportunities for modelling human culture."
Poster,A SARS-CoV-2 Interaction Dataset and VHH Sequence Corpus for Antibody Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97722,"Hirofumi Tsuruta, Hiroyuki Yamazaki, Ryota Maeda, Ryotaro Tamura, Akihiro Imura","Antibodies are crucial proteins produced by the immune system to eliminate harmful foreign substances and have become pivotal therapeutic agents for treating human diseases.To accelerate the discovery of antibody therapeutics, there is growing interest in constructing language models using antibody sequences.However, the applicability of pre-trained language models for antibody discovery has not been thoroughly evaluated due to the scarcity of labeled datasets.To overcome these limitations, we introduce AVIDa-SARS-CoV-2, a dataset featuring the antigen-variable domain of heavy chain of heavy chain antibody (VHH) interactions obtained from two alpacas immunized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike proteins.AVIDa-SARS-CoV-2 includes binary labels indicating the binding or non-binding of diverse VHH sequences to 12 SARS-CoV-2 mutants, such as the Delta and Omicron variants.Furthermore, we release VHHCorpus-2M, a pre-training dataset for antibody language models, containing over two million VHH sequences.We report benchmark results for predicting SARS-CoV-2-VHH binding using VHHBERT pre-trained on VHHCorpus-2M and existing general protein and antibody-specific pre-trained language models.These results confirm that AVIDa-SARS-CoV-2 provides valuable benchmarks for evaluating the representation capabilities of antibody language models for binding prediction, thereby facilitating the development of AI-driven antibody discovery.The datasets are available at https://datasets.cognanous.com."
Poster,A scalable generative model for dynamical system reconstruction from neuroimaging data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94236,"Eric Volkmann, Alena Brändle, Daniel Durstewitz, Georgia Koppe","Data-driven inference of the generative dynamics underlying a set of observed time series is of growing interest in machine learning and the natural sciences. In neuroscience, such methods promise to alleviate the need to handcraft models based on biophysical principles and allow to automatize the inference of inter-individual differences in brain dynamics. Recent breakthroughs in training techniques for state space models (SSMs) specifically geared toward dynamical systems (DS) reconstruction (DSR) enable to recover the underlying system including its geometrical (attractor) and long-term statistical invariants from even short time series. These techniques are based on control-theoretic ideas, like modern variants of teacher forcing (TF), to ensure stable loss gradient propagation while training. However, as it currently stands, these techniques are not directly applicable to data modalities where current observations depend on an entire history of previous states due to a signal’s filtering properties, as common in neuroscience (and physiology more generally). Prominent examples are the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or Ca$^{2+}$ imaging data. Such types of signals render the SSM's decoder model non-invertible, a requirement for previous TF-based methods.Here, exploiting the recent success of control techniques for training SSMs, we propose a novel algorithm that solves this problem and scales exceptionally well with model dimensionality and filter length. We demonstrate its efficiency in reconstructing dynamical systems, including their state space geometry and long-term temporal properties, from just short BOLD time series."
Poster,AsCAN: Asymmetric Convolution-Attention Networks for Efficient Recognition and Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93461,"Anil Kag, n n, Jierun Chen, Junli Cao, Willi Menapace, Aliaksandr Siarohin, Sergey Tulyakov, Jian Ren","Neural network architecture design requires making many crucial decisions. The common desiderata is that similar decisions, with little modifications, can be reused in a variety of tasks and applications. To satisfy that, architectures must provide promising latency and performance trade-offs, support a variety of tasks, scale efficiently with respect to the amounts of data and compute, leverage available data from other tasks, and efficiently support various hardware. To this end, we introduce AsCAN---a hybrid architecture, combining both convolutional and transformer blocks. We revisit the key design principles of hybrid architectures and propose a simple and effective \emph{asymmetric} architecture, where the distribution of convolutional and transformer blocks is \emph{asymmetric}, containing more convolutional blocks in the earlier stages, followed by more transformer blocks in later stages. AsCAN supports a variety of tasks: recognition, segmentation, class-conditional image generation, and features a superior trade-off between performance and latency. We then scale the same architecture to solve a large-scale text-to-image task and show state-of-the-art performance compared to the most recent public and commercial models. Notably, without performing any optimization of inference time our model shows faster execution, even when compared to works that do such optimization, highlighting the advantages and the value of our approach."
Poster,A Separation in Heavy-Tailed Sampling: Gaussian vs. Stable Oracles for Proximal Samplers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92929,"Ye He, Alireza Mousavi-Hosseini, Krishnakumar Balasubramanian, Murat Erdogdu","We study the complexity of heavy-tailed sampling and present a separation result in terms of obtaining high-accuracy versus low-accuracy guarantees i.e., samplers that require only $\mathcal{O}(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ versus $\Omega(\text{poly}(1/\varepsilon))$ iterations to output a sample which is $\varepsilon$-close to the target in $\chi^2$-divergence. Our results are presented for proximal samplers that are based on Gaussian versus stable oracles. We show that proximal samplers based on the Gaussian oracle have a fundamental barrier in that they necessarily achieve only low-accuracy guarantees when sampling from a class of heavy-tailed targets. In contrast, proximal samplers based on the stable oracle exhibit high-accuracy guarantees, thereby overcoming the aforementioned limitation. We also prove lower bounds for samplers under the stable oracle and show that our upper bounds cannot be fundamentally improved."
