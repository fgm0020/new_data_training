Poster,Initializing Variable-sized Vision Transformers from Learngene with Learnable Transformation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96427,"Shiyu Xia, Yuankun Zu, Xu Yang, Xin Geng","In practical scenarios, it is necessary to build variable-sized models to accommodate diverse resource constraints, where weight initialization serves as a crucial step preceding training. The recently introduced Learngene framework firstly learns one compact module, termed learngene, from a large well-trained model, and then transforms learngene to initialize variable-sized models. However, the existing Learngene methods provide limited guidance on transforming learngene, where transformation mechanisms are manually designed and generally lack a learnable component. Moreover, these methods only consider transforming learngene along depth dimension, thus constraining the flexibility of learngene. Motivated by these concerns, we propose a novel and effective Learngene approach termed LeTs (Learnable Transformation), where we transform the learngene module along both width and depth dimension with a set of learnable matrices for flexible variablesized model initialization. Specifically, we construct an auxiliary model comprising the compact learngene module and learnable transformation matrices, enabling both components to be trained. To meet the varying size requirements of target models, we select specific parameters from well-trained transformation matrices to adaptively transform the learngene, guided by strategies such as continuous selection and magnitude-wise selection. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that Des-Nets initialized via LeTs outperform those with 100-epoch from scratch training after only 1 epoch tuning. When transferring to downstream image classification tasks, LeTs achieves better results while outperforming from scratch training after about 10 epochs within a 300-epoch training schedule."
Poster,Injecting Undetectable Backdoors in Obfuscated Neural Networks and Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95629,"Alkis Kalavasis, Amin Karbasi, Argyris Oikonomou, Katerina Sotiraki, Grigoris Velegkas, Manolis Zampetakis","As ML models become increasingly complex and integral to high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare, they also become more susceptible to sophisticated adversarial attacks. We investigate the threat posed by undetectable backdoors, as defined in Goldwasser et al. [2022], in models developed by insidious external expert firms. When such backdoors exist, they allow the designer of the model to sell information on how to slightly perturb their input to change the outcome of the model. We develop a general strategy to plant backdoors to obfuscated neural networks, that satisfy the security properties of the celebrated notion of indistinguishability obfuscation. Applying obfuscation before releasing neural networks is a strategy that is well motivated to protect sensitive information of the external expert firm. Our method to plant backdoors ensures that even if the weights and architecture of the obfuscated model are accessible, the existence ofthe backdoor is still undetectable. Finally, we introduce the notion of undetectable backdoors to language models and extend our neural network backdoor attacks to such models based on the existence of steganographic functions."
Poster,In-N-Out: Lifting 2D Diffusion Prior for 3D Object Removal via Tuning-Free Latents Alignment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94129,"Dongting Hu, Huan Fu, Jiaxian Guo, Liuhua Peng, Tingjin Chu, Feng Liu, Tongliang Liu, Mingming Gong","Neural representations for 3D scenes have made substantial advancements recently, yet object removal remains a challenging yet practical issue, due to the absence of multi-view supervision over occluded areas.  Diffusion Models (DMs), trained on extensive 2D images, show diverse and high-fidelity generative capabilities in the 2D domain. However, due to not being specifically trained on 3D data, their application to multi-view data often exacerbates inconsistency, hence impacting the overall quality of the 3D output. To address these issues, we introduce ""In-N-Out"", a novel approach that begins by inpainting a prior, i.e., the occluded area from a single view using DMs, followed by outstretching it to create multi-view inpaintings via latents alignments. Our analysis identifies that the variability in DMs' outputs mainly arises from initially sampled latents and intermediate latents predicted in the denoising process. We explicitly align of initial latents using a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) to establish a consistent foundational structure in the inpainted area,  complemented by an implicit alignment of intermediate latents through cross-view attention during the denoising phases, enhancing appearance consistency across views. To further enhance rendering results, we apply a patch-based hybrid loss to optimize NeRF. We demonstrate that our techniques effectively mitigate the challenges posed by inconsistencies in DMs and substantially improve the fidelity and coherence of inpainted 3D representations."
Poster,In Pursuit of Causal Label Correlations for Multi-label Image Recognition,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93033,"Zhao-Min Chen, Xin Jin, YisuGe, Sixian Chan","Multi-label image recognition aims to predict all objects present in an input image. A common belief is that modeling the correlations between objects is beneficial for multi-label recognition. However, this belief has been recently challenged as label correlations may mislead the classifier in testing, due to the possible contextual bias in training. Accordingly, a few of recent works not only discarded label correlation modeling, but also advocated to remove contextual information for multi-label image recognition. This work explicitly explores label correlations for multi-label image recognition based on a principled causal intervention approach. With causal intervention, we pursue causal label correlations and suppress spurious label correlations, as the former tend to convey useful contextual cues while the later may mislead the classifier. Specifically, we decouple label-specific features with a Transformer decoder attached to the backbone network, and model the confounders which may give rise to spurious correlations by clustering spatial features of all training images. Based on label-specific features and confounders, we employ a cross-attention module to implement causal intervention, quantifying the causal correlations from all object categories to each predicted object category. Finally, we obtain image labels by combining the predictions from decoupled features and causal label correlations. Extensive experiments clearly validate the effectiveness of our approach for multi-label image recognition in both common and cross-dataset settings."
Poster,Input-to-State Stable Coupled Oscillator Networks for Closed-form Model-based Control in Latent Space,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93881,"Maximilian Stölzle, Cosimo Della Santina","Even though a variety of methods have been proposed in the literature, efficient and effective latent-space control (i.e., control in a learned low-dimensional space) of physical systems remains an open challenge.We argue that a promising avenue is to leverage powerful and well-understood closed-form strategies from control theory literature in combination with learned dynamics, such as potential-energy shaping.We identify three fundamental shortcomings in existing latent-space models that have so far prevented this powerful combination: (i) they lack the mathematical structure of a physical system, (ii) they do not inherently conserve the stability properties of the real systems, (iii) these methods do not have an invertible mapping between input and latent-space forcing.This work proposes a novel Coupled Oscillator Network (CON) model that simultaneously tackles all these issues. More specifically, (i) we show analytically that CON is a Lagrangian system - i.e., it possesses well-defined potential and kinetic energy terms. Then, (ii) we provide formal proof of global Input-to-State stability using Lyapunov arguments.Moving to the experimental side, we demonstrate that CON reaches SoA performance when learning complex nonlinear dynamics of mechanical systems directly from images.An additional methodological innovation contributing to achieving this third goal is an approximated closed-form solution for efficient integration of network dynamics, which eases efficient training.We tackle (iii) by approximating the forcing-to-input mapping with a decoder that is trained to reconstruct the input based on the encoded latent space force.Finally, we leverage these three properties and show that they enable latent-space control. We use an integral-saturated PID with potential force compensation and demonstrate high-quality performance on a soft robot using raw pixels as the only feedback information."
Poster,INQUIRE: A Natural World Text-to-Image Retrieval Benchmark,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97543,"Edward Vendrow, Omiros Pantazis, Alexander Shepard, Gabriel Brostow, Kate Jones, Oisin Mac Aodha, Sara Beery, Grant Van Horn","We introduce INQUIRE, a text-to-image retrieval benchmark designed to challenge multimodal vision-language models on expert-level queries. INQUIRE includes iNaturalist 2024 (iNat24), a new dataset of five million natural world images, along with 250 expert-level retrieval queries. These queries are paired with all relevant images comprehensively labeled within iNat24, comprising 33,000 total matches. Queries span categories such as species identification, context, behavior, and appearance, emphasizing tasks that require nuanced image understanding and domain expertise. Our benchmark evaluates two core retrieval tasks: (1) INQUIRE-Fullrank, a full dataset ranking task, and (2) INQUIRE-Rerank, a reranking task for refining top-100 retrievals. Detailed evaluation of a range of recent multimodal models demonstrates that INQUIRE poses a significant challenge, with the best models failing to achieve an mAP@50 above 50%. In addition, we show that reranking with more powerful multimodal models can enhance retrieval performance, yet there remains a significant margin for improvement. By focusing on scientifically-motivated ecological challenges, INQUIRE aims to bridge the gap between AI capabilities and the needs of real-world scientific inquiry, encouraging the development of retrieval systems that can assist with accelerating ecological and biodiversity research."
Poster,Instance-adaptive Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought Prompting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96779,"Xiaosong Yuan, Chen Shen, Shaotian Yan, Xiaofeng Zhang, Liang Xie, Wenxiao Wang, Renchu Guan, Ying Wang, Jieping Ye","Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting emerges as a simple and effective strategy for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) in real-world reasoning tasks. Nonetheless, the efficacy of a singular, task-level prompt uniformly applied across the whole of instances is inherently limited since one prompt cannot be a good partner for all, a more appropriate approach should consider the interaction between the prompt and each instance meticulously. This work introduces an instance-adaptive prompting algorithm as an alternative zero-shot CoT reasoning scheme by adaptively differentiating good and bad prompts. Concretely, we first employ analysis on LLMs through the lens of information flow to detect the mechanism under zero-shot CoT reasoning, in which we discover that information flows from question to prompt and question to rationale jointly influence the reasoning results most. We notice that a better zero-shot CoT reasoning needs the prompt to obtain semantic information from the question then the rationale aggregates sufficient information from the question directly and via the prompt indirectly. On the contrary, lacking any of those would probably lead to a bad one. Stem from that, we further propose an instance-adaptive prompting strategy (IAP) for zero-shot CoT reasoning. Experiments conducted with LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and Qwen on math, logic, and commonsense reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K, MMLU, Causal Judgement) obtain consistent improvement, demonstrating that the instance-adaptive zero-shot CoT prompting performs better than other task-level methods with some curated prompts or sophisticated procedures, showing the significance of our findings in the zero-shot CoT reasoning mechanism."
Poster,Instance-Optimal Private Density Estimation in the Wasserstein Distance,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96229,"Vitaly Feldman, Audra McMillan, Satchit Sivakumar, Kunal Talwar","Estimating the density of a distribution from samples is a fundamental problem in statistics. In many practical settings, the Wasserstein distance is an appropriate error metric for density estimation. For example, when estimating population densities in a geographic region, a small Wasserstein distance means that the estimate is able to capture roughly where the population mass is. In this work we study differentially private density estimation in the Wasserstein distance. We design and analyze instance-optimal algorithms for this problem that can adapt to easy instances.For distributions $P$ over $\mathbb{R}$, we consider a strong notion of instance-optimality: an algorithm that uniformly achieves the instance-optimal estimation rate is competitive with an algorithm that is told that the distribution is either $P$ or $Q_P$ for some distribution $Q_P$ whose probability density function (pdf) is within a factor of 2 of the pdf of $P$. For distributions over $\mathbb{R}^2$, we use a slightly different notion of instance optimality. We say that an algorithm is instance-optimal if it is competitive with an algorithm that is given a constant multiplicative approximation of the density of the distribution. We characterize the instance-optimal estimation rates in both these settings and show that they are uniformly achievable (up to polylogarithmic factors). Our approach for $\mathbb{R}^2$ extends to arbitrary metric spaces as it goes via hierarchically separated trees. As a special case our results lead to instance-optimal learning in TV distance for discrete distributions."
Poster,Instance-Specific Asymmetric Sensitivity in Differential Privacy,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96679,David Durfee,"We provide a new algorithmic framework for differentially private estimation of general functions that adapts to the hardness of the underlying dataset. We build upon previous work that gives a paradigm for selecting an output through the exponential mechanism based upon closeness of the inverse to the underlying dataset, termed the inverse sensitivity mechanism. Our framework will slightly modify the closeness metric and instead give a simple and efficient application of the sparse vector technique. While the inverse sensitivity mechanism was shown to be instance optimal, it was only with respect to a class of unbiased mechanisms such that the most likely outcome matches the underlying data. We break this assumption in order to more naturally navigate the bias-variance tradeoff, which will also critically allow for extending our method to unbounded data. In consideration of this tradeoff, we provide theoretical guarantees and empirical validation that our technique will be particularly effective when the distances to the underlying dataset are asymmetric. This asymmetry is inherent to a range of important problems including fundamental statistics such as variance, as well as commonly used machine learning performance metrics for both classification and regression tasks. We efficiently instantiate our method in $O(n)$ time for these problems and empirically show that our techniques will give substantially improved differentially private estimations."
Poster,InstructG2I: Synthesizing Images from Multimodal Attributed Graphs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92951,"Bowen Jin, Ziqi Pang, Bingjun Guo, Yu-Xiong Wang, Jiaxuan You, Jiawei Han","In this paper, we approach an overlooked yet critical task Graph2Image: generating images from multimodal attributed graphs (MMAGs). This task poses significant challenges due to the explosion in graph size, dependencies among graph entities, and the need for controllability in graph conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a graph context-conditioned diffusion model called InstructG2I. InstructG2I first exploits the graph structure and multimodal information to conduct informative neighbor sampling by combining personalized page rank and re-ranking based on vision-language features. Then, a graph QFormer encoder adaptively encodes the graph nodes into an auxiliary set of graph prompts to guide the denoising process of diffusion. Finally, we propose graph classifier-free guidance, enabling controllable generation by varying the strength of graph guidance and multiple connected edges to a node. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness and controllability of our approach.
