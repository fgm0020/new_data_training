Poster,Shaving Weights with Occam's Razor: Bayesian Sparsification for Neural Networks using the Marginal Likelihood,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95142,"Rayen Dhahri, Alexander Immer, Bertrand Charpentier, Stephan Günnemann, Vincent Fortuin","Neural network sparsification is a promising avenue to save computational time and memory costs, especially in an age where many successful AI models are becoming too large to naively deploy on consumer hardware. While much work has focused on different weight pruning criteria, the overall sparsifiability of the network, i.e., its capacity to be pruned without quality loss, has often been overlooked. We present Sparsifiability via the Marginal likelihood (SpaM), a sparsification framework that highlights the effectiveness of using the Bayesian marginal likelihood in conjunction with sparsity-inducing priors for making neural networks more sparsifiable. Our approach implements an automatic Occam's razor that selects the most sparsifiable model that still explains the data well, both for structured and unstructured sparsification. In addition, we demonstrate that the pre-computed posterior precision from the Laplace approximation can be re-used to define a cheap pruning criterion, which outperforms many existing (more expensive) approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, especially at high sparsity levels, across a range of different neural network architectures and datasets."
Poster,"SHDocs: A dataset, benchmark, and method to efficiently generate high-quality, real-world specular highlight data with near-perfect alignment",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97715,"Jovin Leong, Koa Di, Benjamin Cham, Shaun Heng","A frequent problem in vision-based reasoning tasks such as object detection and optical character recognition (OCR) is the persistence of specular highlights. Specular highlights appear as bright spots of glare that occur due to the concentrated reflection of light; these spots manifest as image artifacts which occlude computer vision models and are challenging to reconstruct. Despite this, specular highlight removal receives relatively little attention due to the difficulty of acquiring high-quality, real-world data. We introduce a method to generate specular highlight data with near-perfect alignment and present SHDocs—a dataset of specular highlights on document images created using our method. Through our benchmark, we demonstrate that our dataset enables us to surpass the performance of state-of-the-art specular highlight removal models and downstream OCR tasks. We release our dataset, code, and methods publicly to motivate further exploration of image enhancement for practical computer vision challenges."
Poster,SHED: Shapley-Based Automated Dataset Refinement for Instruction Fine-Tuning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95873,"Yexiao He, Ziyao Wang, Zheyu Shen, Guoheng Sun, Yucong Dai, Yongkai Wu, Hongyi Wang, Ang Li","The pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted for many downstream tasks and tailored to align with human preferences through fine-tuning. Recent studies have discovered that LLMs can achieve desirable performance with only a small amount of high-quality data, suggesting that a large portion of the data in these extensive datasets is redundant or even harmful. Identifying high-quality data from vast datasets to curate small yet effective datasets has emerged as a critical challenge. In this paper, we introduce SHED, an automated dataset refinement framework based on Shapley value for instruction fine-tuning. SHED eliminates the need for human intervention or the use of commercial LLMs. Moreover, the datasets curated through SHED exhibit transferability, indicating they can be reused across different LLMs with consistently high performance. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the datasets curated by SHED. The results demonstrate SHED's superiority over state-of-the-art methods across various tasks and LLMs; notably, datasets comprising only 10% of the original data selected by SHED achieve performance comparable to or surpassing that of the full datasets."
Poster,ShiftAddLLM: Accelerating Pretrained LLMs via Post-Training Multiplication-Less Reparameterization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95715,"Haoran You, Yipin Guo, Yichao Fu, Wei Zhou, Huihong Shi, Xiaofan Zhang, Souvik Kundu, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Yingyan (Celine) Lin","Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on language tasks but face challenges when deployed on resource-constrained devices due to their extensive parameters and reliance on dense multiplications, resulting in high memory demands and latency bottlenecks. Shift-and-add reparameterization offers a promising solution by replacing costly multiplications with hardware-friendly primitives in both the attention and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers of an LLM. However, current reparameterization techniques require training from scratch or full parameter fine-tuning to restore accuracy, which is resource-intensive for LLMs. To address this, we propose accelerating pretrained LLMs through post-training shift-and-add reparameterization, creating efficient multiplication-free models, dubbed ShiftAddLLM. Specifically, we quantize each weight matrix into binary matrices paired with group-wise scaling factors. The associated multiplications are reparameterized into (1) shifts between activations and scaling factors and (2) queries and adds according to the binary matrices. To reduce accuracy loss, we present a multi-objective optimization method to minimize both weight and output activation reparameterization errors. Additionally, based on varying sensitivity across layers to reparameterization, we develop an automated bit allocation strategy to further reduce memory usage and latency. Experiments on five LLM families and eight tasks consistently validate the effectiveness of ShiftAddLLM, achieving average perplexity reductions of 5.6 and 22.7 points at comparable or lower latency compared to the most competitive quantized LLMs at 3- and 2-bit precision, respectively, and more than 80% memory and energy reductions over the original LLMs. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/GATECH-EIC/ShiftAddLLM."
Poster,SHMT: Self-supervised Hierarchical Makeup Transfer via Latent Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96021,"Zhaoyang Sun, Shengwu Xiong, Yaxiong Chen, Fei Du, Weihua Chen, Fan Wang, Yi Rong","This paper studies the challenging task of makeup transfer, which aims to apply diverse makeup styles precisely and naturally to a given facial image.  Due to the absence of paired data, current methods typically synthesize sub-optimal pseudo ground truths to guide the model training, resulting in low makeup fidelity. Additionally, different makeup styles generally have varying effects on the person face, but existing methods struggle to deal with this diversity. To address these issues, we propose a novel Self-supervised Hierarchical Makeup Transfer (SHMT) method via latent diffusion models. Following a ""decoupling-and-reconstruction"" paradigm, SHMT works in a self-supervised manner, freeing itself from the misguidance of imprecise pseudo-paired data. Furthermore, to accommodate a variety of makeup styles, hierarchical texture details are decomposed via a Laplacian pyramid and selectively introduced to the content representation. Finally, we design a novel Iterative Dual Alignment (IDA) module that dynamically adjusts the injection condition of the diffusion model, allowing the alignment errors caused by the domain gap between content and makeup representations to be corrected. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Snowfallingplum/SHMT."
Poster,Shopping MMLU: A Massive Multi-Task Online Shopping Benchmark for Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97808,"Yilun Jin, Zheng Li, Chenwei Zhang, Tianyu Cao, Yifan Gao, Pratik Jayarao, Mao Li, Xin Liu, Ritesh Sarkhel, Xianfeng Tang, Haodong Wang, Zhengyang Wang, Wenju Xu, Jingfeng Yang, Qingyu Yin, Xian Li, Priyanka Nigam, Yi Xu, Kai Chen, Qiang Yang, Meng Jiang, Bing Yin","Online shopping is a complex multi-task, few-shot learning problem with a wide and evolving range of entities, relations, and tasks. However, existing models and benchmarks are commonly tailored to specific tasks, falling short of capturing the full complexity of online shopping. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their multi-task and few-shot learning abilities, have the potential to profoundly transform online shopping by alleviating task-specific engineering efforts and by providing users with interactive conversations. Despite the potential, LLMs face unique challenges in online shopping, such as domain-specific concepts, implicit knowledge, and heterogeneous user behaviors. Motivated by the potential and challenges, we propose Shopping MMLU, a diverse multi-task online shopping benchmark derived from real-world Amazon data. Shopping MMLU consists of 57 tasks covering 4 major shopping skills: concept understanding, knowledge reasoning, user behavior alignment, and multi-linguality, and can thus comprehensively evaluate the abilities of LLMs as general shop assistants. With Shoppping MMLU, we benchmark over 20 existing LLMs and uncover valuable insights about practices and prospects of building versatile LLM-based shop assistants. Shopping MMLU can be publicly accessed at https://github.com/KL4805/ShoppingMMLU. In addition, with Shopping MMLU, we are hosting a competition in KDD Cup 2024 with over 500 participating teams. The winning solutions and the associated workshop can be accessed at our website https://amazon-kddcup24.github.io/."
Poster,Should We Really Edit Language Models? On the Evaluation of Edited Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93785,"Qi Li, Xiang Liu, Zhenheng Tang, Peijie Dong, Zeyu Li, Xinglin Pan, Xiaowen Chu","Model editing has become an increasingly popular alternative for efficiently updating knowledge within language models. Current methods mainly focus on reliability, generalization, and locality,  with many methods excelling across these criteria. Some recent works disclose the pitfalls of these editing methods such as knowledge distortion or conflict. However, the general abilities of post-edited language models remain unexplored. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive evaluation on various editing methods and different language models, and have following findings.(1) Existing editing methods lead to inevitable performance deterioration on general benchmarks, indicating that existing editing methods maintain the general abilities of the model within only a few dozen edits.When the number of edits is slightly large, the intrinsic knowledge structure of the model is disrupted or even completely damaged. (2) Instruction-tuned models are more robust to editing, showing less performance drop on general knowledge after editing. (3) Language model with large scale is more resistant to editing compared to small model.(4) The safety of the edited model, is significantly weakened, even for those safety-aligned models.Our findings indicate that current editing methods are only suitable for small-scale knowledge updates within language models, which motivates further research on more practical and reliable editing methods."
Poster,ShowMaker: Creating High-Fidelity 2D Human Video via Fine-Grained Diffusion Modeling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93798,"Quanwei Yang, Jiazhi Guan, Kaisiyuan Wang, Lingyun Yu, Wenqing Chu, Hang Zhou, ZhiQiang Feng, Haocheng Feng, Errui Ding, Jingdong Wang, Hongtao Xie","Although significant progress has been made in human video generation, most previous studies focus on either human facial animation or full-body animation, which cannot be directly applied to produce realistic conversational human videos with frequent hand gestures and various facial movements simultaneously.To address these limitations, we propose a 2D human video generation framework, named ShowMaker, capable of generating high-fidelity half-body conversational videos via fine-grained diffusion modeling.We leverage dual-stream diffusion models as the backbone of our framework and carefully design two novel components for crucial local regions (i.e., hands and face) that can be easily integrated into our backbone.Specifically, to handle the challenging hand generation caused by sparse motion guidance, we propose a novel Key Point-based Fine-grained Hand Modeling module by amplifying positional information from raw hand key points and constructing a corresponding key point-based codebook. Moreover, to restore richer facial details in generated results, we introduce a Face Recapture module, which extracts facial texture features and global identity features from the aligned human face and integrates them into the diffusion process for face enhancement. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior visual quality and temporal consistency of our method."
Poster,Shuffling Gradient-Based Methods for Nonconvex-Concave Minimax Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93811,"Quoc Tran Dinh, Trang H. Tran, Lam Nguyen","This paper aims at developing novel shuffling gradient-based methods for tackling two classes of minimax problems: nonconvex-linear and nonconvex-strongly concave settings. The first algorithm addresses the nonconvex-linear minimax model and achieves the state-of-the-art oracle complexity typically observed in nonconvex optimization.  It also employs a new shuffling estimator for the ``hyper-gradient'', departing from standard shuffling techniques in optimization. The second method consists of two variants: semi-shuffling and full-shuffling schemes.  These variants tackle the nonconvex-strongly concave minimax setting.  We establish their oracle complexity bounds under standard assumptions, which, to our best knowledge, are the best-known for this specific setting. Numerical examples demonstrate the performance of our algorithms and compare them with two other methods.  Our results show that the new methods achieve comparable performance with SGD, supporting the potential of incorporating shuffling strategies into minimax algorithms."
Poster,Sigmoid Gating is More Sample Efficient than Softmax Gating in Mixture of Experts,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95780,"Huy Nguyen, Nhat Ho, Alessandro Rinaldo","The softmax gating function is arguably the most popular choice in mixture of experts modeling. Despite its widespread use in practice, the softmax gating may lead to unnecessary competition among experts, potentially causing the undesirable phenomenon of representation collapse due to its inherent structure. In response, the sigmoid gating function has been recently proposed as an alternative and has been demonstrated empirically to achieve superior performance. However, a rigorous examination of the sigmoid gating function is lacking in current literature. In this paper, we verify theoretically that the sigmoid gating, in fact, enjoys a higher sample efficiency than the softmax gating for the statistical task of expert estimation. Towards that goal, we consider a regression framework in which the unknown regression function is modeled as a mixture of experts, and study the rates of convergence of the least squares estimator under the over-specified case in which the number of fitted experts is larger than the true value. We show that two gating regimes naturally arise and, in each of them, we formulate an identifiability condition for the expert functions and derive the corresponding convergence rates. In both cases, we find that experts formulated as feed-forward networks with commonly used activation such as $\mathrm{ReLU}$ and $\mathrm{GELU}$ enjoy faster convergence rates under the sigmoid gating than those under softmax gating. Furthermore, given the same choice of experts, we demonstrate that the sigmoid gating function requires a smaller sample size than its softmax counterpart to attain the same error of expert estimation and, therefore, is more sample efficient."
