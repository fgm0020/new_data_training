Poster,Semi-Truths: A Large-Scale Dataset of AI-Augmented Images for Evaluating Robustness of AI-Generated Image detectors,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97591,"Anisha Pal, Julia Kruk, Mansi Phute, Manognya Bhattaram, Diyi Yang, Duen Horng Chau, Judy Hoffman","Text-to-image diffusion models have impactful applications in art, design, and entertainment, yet these technologies also pose significant risks by enabling the creation and dissemination of misinformation. Although recent advancements have produced AI-generated image detectors that claim robustness against various augmentations, their true effectiveness remains uncertain. Do these detectors reliably identify images with different levels of augmentation? Are they biased toward specific scenes or data distributions? To investigate, we introduce **Semi-Truths**, featuring $27,600$ real images, $223,400$ masks, and $1, 329, 155$ AI-augmented images that feature targeted and localized perturbations produced using diverse augmentation techniques, diffusion models, and data distributions. Each augmented image is accompanied by metadata for standardized and targeted evaluation of detector robustness. Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art detectors exhibit varying sensitivities to the types and degrees of perturbations, data distributions, and augmentation methods used, offering new insights into their performance and limitations. The code for the augmentation and evaluation pipeline is available at https://github.com/J-Kruk/SemiTruths."
Poster,Separate and Reconstruct: Asymmetric Encoder-Decoder for Speech Separation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96323,"Ui-Hyeop Shin, Sangyoun Lee, Taehan Kim, Hyung-Min Park","In speech separation, time-domain approaches have successfully replaced the time-frequency domain with latent sequence feature from a learnable encoder. Conventionally, the feature is separated into speaker-specific ones at the final stage of the network. Instead, we propose a more intuitive strategy that separates features earlier by expanding the feature sequence to the number of speakers as an extra dimension. To achieve this, an asymmetric strategy is presented in which the encoder and decoder are partitioned to perform distinct processing in separation tasks. The encoder analyzes features, and the output of the encoder is split into the number of speakers to be separated. The separated sequences are then reconstructed by the weight-shared decoder, which also performs cross-speaker processing. Without relying on speaker information, the weight-shared network in the decoder directly learns to discriminate features using a separation objective. In addition, to improve performance, traditional methods have extended the sequence length, leading to the adoption of dual-path models, which handle the much longer sequence effectively by segmenting it into chunks. To address this, we introduce global and local Transformer blocks that can directly handle long sequences more efficiently without chunking and dual-path processing. The experimental results demonstrated that this asymmetric structure is effective and that the combination of proposed global and local Transformer can sufficiently replace the role of inter- and intra-chunk processing in dual-path structure. Finally, the presented model combining both of these achieved state-of-the-art performance with much less computation in various benchmark datasets."
Poster,Separation and Bias of Deep Equilibrium Models on Expressivity and Learning Dynamics,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94976,"Zhoutong Wu, Yimu Zhang, Cong Fang, Zhouchen Lin","The deep equilibrium model (DEQ) generalizes the conventional feedforward neural network by fixing the same weights for each layer block and extending the number of layers to infinity. This novel model directly finds the fixed points of such a forward process as features for prediction.  Despite empirical evidence showcasing its efficacy compared to feedforward neural networks, a theoretical understanding for its separation and bias is still limited.  In this paper, we take a stepby proposing some separations and studying the bias of DEQ in its expressive power and learning dynamics.   The results include: (1) A general separation is proposed, showing the existence of a width-$m$ DEQ that any fully connected neural networks (FNNs) with depth $O(m^{\alpha})$ for $\alpha \in (0,1)$ cannotapproximate unless its width is sub-exponential in $m$; (2) DEQ with polynomially bounded size and magnitude can efficiently approximate certain steep functions (which has very large derivatives) in $L^{\infty}$ norm, whereas FNN with bounded depth and exponentially bounded width cannot unless its weights magnitudes are exponentially large; (3) The implicit regularization caused by gradient flow from a diagonal linear DEQ is characterized, with specific examples showing the benefits brought by such regularization. From the overall study, a high-level conjecture from our analysis and empirical validations is that DEQ has potential advantages in learning certain high-frequency components."
Poster,Separations in the Representational Capabilities of Transformers and Recurrent Architectures,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96535,"Satwik Bhattamishra, Michael Hahn, Phil Blunsom, Varun Kanade","Transformer architectures have been widely adopted in foundation models. Due to their high inference costs, there is renewed interest in exploring the potential of efficient recurrent architectures (RNNs). In this paper, we analyze the differences in the representational capabilities of Transformers and RNNs across several tasks of practical relevance, including index lookup, nearest neighbor, recognizing bounded Dyck languages, and string equality.  For the tasks considered, our results show separations based on the size of the model required for different architectures. For example, we show that a one-layer Transformer of logarithmic width can perform index lookup, whereas an RNN requires a hidden state of linear size.  Conversely, while constant-size RNNs can recognize bounded Dyck languages, we show that one-layer Transformers require a linear size for this task. Furthermore, we show that two-layer Transformers of logarithmic size can perform decision tasks such as string equality or disjointness, whereas both one-layer Transformers and recurrent models require linear size for these tasks. We also show that a log-size two-layer Transformer can implement the nearest neighbor algorithm in its forward pass; on the other hand recurrent models require linear size. Our constructions are based on the existence of $N$ nearly orthogonal vectors in $O(\log N)$ dimensional space and our lower bounds are based on reductions from communication complexity problems.  We supplement our theoretical results with experiments that highlight the differences in the performance of these architectures on practical-size sequences."
Poster,Sequence-Augmented SE(3)-Flow Matching For Conditional Protein Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93544,"Guillaume Huguet, James Vuckovic, Kilian FATRAS, Eric Thibodeau-Laufer, Pablo Lemos, Riashat Islam, Chenghao Liu, Jarrid Rector-Brooks, Tara Akhound-Sadegh, Michael Bronstein, Alexander Tong, Joey Bose","Proteins are essential for almost all biological processes and derive their diverse functions from complex $3 \rm D$ structures, which are in turn determined by their amino acid sequences. In this paper, we exploit the rich biological inductive bias of amino acid sequences and introduce FoldFlow++, a novel sequence-conditioned $\text{SE}(3)$-equivariant flow matching model for protein structure generation. FoldFlow++ presents substantial new architectural features over the previous FoldFlow family of models including a protein large language model to encode sequence, a new multi-modal fusion trunk that combines structure and sequence representations, and a geometric transformer based decoder. To increase diversity and novelty of generated samples -- crucial for de-novo drug design -- wetrain FoldFlow++ at scale on a new dataset that is an order of magnitude larger than PDB datasets of prior works, containing both known proteins in PDB and high-quality synthetic structures achieved through filtering. We further demonstrate the ability to align FoldFlow++ to arbitrary rewards, e.g. increasing secondary structures diversity, by introducing a Reinforced Finetuning (ReFT) objective. We empirically observe that FoldFlow++ outperforms previous state-of-the-art protein structure-based generative models, improving over RFDiffusion in terms of unconditional generation across all metrics including designability, diversity, and novelty across all protein lengths, as well as exhibiting generalization on the task of equilibrium conformation sampling. Finally, we demonstrate that a fine-tuned FoldFlow++ makes progress on challenging conditional design tasks such as designing scaffolds for the VHH nanobody."
Poster,SequentialAttention++ for Block Sparsification: Differentiable Pruning Meets Combinatorial Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96174,"Taisuke Yasuda, Kyriakos Axiotis, Gang Fu, Mohammadhossein Bateni, Vahab Mirrokni","Neural network pruning is a key technique towards engineering large yet scalable, interpretable, and generalizable models. Prior work on the subject has developed largely along two orthogonal directions: (1) differentiable pruning for efficiently and accurately scoring the importance of parameters, and (2) combinatorial optimization for efficiently searching over the space of sparse models. We unite the two approaches, both theoretically and empirically, to produce a coherent framework for structured neural network pruning in which differentiable pruning guides combinatorial optimization algorithms to select the most important sparse set of parameters. Theoretically, we show how many existing differentiable pruning techniques can be understood as nonconvex regularization for group sparse optimization, and prove that for a wide class of nonconvex regularizers, the global optimum is unique, group-sparse, and provably yields an approximate solution to a sparse convex optimization problem. The resulting algorithm that we propose, SequentialAttention++, advances the state of the art in large-scale neural network block-wise pruning tasks on the ImageNet and Criteo datasets."
Poster,Sequential Decision Making with Expert Demonstrations under Unobserved Heterogeneity,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94442,"Vahid Balazadeh, Keertana Chidambaram, Viet Nguyen, Rahul Krishnan, Vasilis Syrgkanis","We study the problem of online sequential decision-making given auxiliary demonstrations from _experts_ who made their decisions based on unobserved contextual information. These demonstrations can be viewed as solving related but slightly different tasks than what the learner faces.  This setting arises in many application domains, such as self-driving cars, healthcare, and finance, where expert demonstrations are made using contextual information, which is not recorded in the data available to the learning agent. We model the problem as a zero-shot meta-reinforcement learning setting with an unknown task distribution and a Bayesian regret minimization objective, where the unobserved tasks are encoded as parameters with an unknown prior. We propose the Experts-as-Priors algorithm (ExPerior), an empirical Bayes approach that utilizes expert data to establish an informative prior distribution over the learner's decision-making problem. This prior enables the application of any Bayesian approach for online decision-making, such as posterior sampling. We demonstrate that our strategy surpasses existing behaviour cloning and online algorithms, as well as online-offline baselines for multi-armed bandits, Markov decision processes (MDPs), and partially observable MDPs, showcasing the broad reach and utility of ExPerior in using expert demonstrations across different decision-making setups."
Poster,Sequential Harmful Shift Detection Without Labels,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93934,"Salim I. Amoukou, Tom Bewley, Saumitra Mishra, Freddy Lecue, Daniele Magazzeni, Manuela Veloso","We introduce a novel approach for detecting distribution shifts that negatively impact the performance of machine learning models in continuous production environments, which requires no access to ground truth data labels. It builds upon the work of Podkopaev and Ramdas [2022], who address scenarios where labels are available for tracking model errors over time. Our solution extends this framework to work in the absence of labels, by employing a proxy for the true error. This proxy is derived using the predictions of a trained error estimator. Experiments show that our method has high power and false alarm control under various distribution shifts, including covariate and label shifts and natural shifts over geography and time."
Poster,"Sequential Probability Assignment with Contexts: Minimax Regret, Contextual Shtarkov Sums, and Contextual Normalized Maximum Likelihood",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93273,"Ziyi Liu, Idan Attias, Dan Roy","We study the fundamental problem of sequential probability assignment, also known as online learning with logarithmic loss, with respect to an arbitrary, possibly nonparametric hypothesis class. Our goal is to obtain a complexity measure for the hypothesis class that characterizes the minimax regret and to determine a general, minimax optimal algorithm. Notably, the sequential $\ell_{\infty}$ entropy, extensively studied in the literature (Rakhlin and Sridharan, 2015, Bilodeau et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2023), was shown to not characterize minimax regret in general. Inspired by the seminal work of Shtarkov (1987)    and Rakhlin, Sridharan, and Tewari (2010), we introduce a novel complexity measure, the \emph{contextual Shtarkov sum}, corresponding to the Shtarkov sum after projection onto a multiary context tree, and show that the worst case log contextual Shtarkov sum equals the minimax regret. Using the contextual Shtarkov sum, we derive the minimax optimal strategy, dubbed \emph{contextual Normalized Maximum Likelihood} (cNML). Our results hold for sequential experts, beyond binary labels, which are settings rarely considered in prior work.     To illustrate the utility of this characterization, we provide a short proof of a new regret upper bound in terms of sequential $\ell_{\infty}$ entropy, unifying and sharpening state-of-the-art bounds by Bilodeau et al. (2020) and Wu et al. (2023)."
Poster,Sequential Signal Mixing Aggregation for Message Passing Graph Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94554,"Mitchell Keren Taraday, Almog David, Chaim Baskin","Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MPGNNs) have emerged as the preferred method for modeling complex interactions across diverse graph entities. While the theory of such models is well understood, their aggregation module has not received sufficient attention. Sum-based aggregators have solid theoretical foundations regarding their separation capabilities. However, practitioners often prefer using more complex aggregations and mixtures of diverse aggregations. In this work, we unveil a possible explanation for this gap. We claim that sum-based aggregators fail to ""mix"" features belonging to distinct neighbors, preventing them from succeeding at downstream tasks.To this end, we introduce Sequential Signal Mixing Aggregation (SSMA), a novel plug-and-play aggregation for MPGNNs. SSMA treats the neighbor features as 2D discrete signals and sequentially convolves them, inherently enhancing the ability to mix features attributed to distinct neighbors. By performing extensive experiments, we show that when combining SSMA with well-established MPGNN architectures, we achieve substantial performance gains across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results in many settings.We published our code at https://almogdavid.github.io/SSMA/."
