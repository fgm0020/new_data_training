Poster,A Benchmark Dataset for Event-Guided Human Pose Estimation and Tracking in Extreme Conditions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97631,"Hoonhee Cho, Taewoo Kim, Yuhwan Jeong, Kuk-Jin Yoon","Multi-person pose estimation and tracking have been actively researched by the computer vision community due to their practical applicability. However, existing human pose estimation and tracking datasets have only been successful in typical scenarios, such as those without motion blur or with well-lit conditions. These RGB-based datasets are limited to learning under extreme motion blur situations or poor lighting conditions, making them inherently vulnerable to such scenarios.As a promising solution, bio-inspired event cameras exhibit robustness in extreme scenarios due to their high dynamic range and micro-second level temporal resolution. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a new hybrid dataset encompassing both RGB and event data for human pose estimation and tracking in two extreme scenarios: low-light and motion blur environments. The proposed Event-guided Human Pose Estimation and Tracking in eXtreme Conditions (EHPT-XC) dataset covers cases of motion blur caused by dynamic objects and low-light conditions individually as well as both simultaneously. With EHPT-XC, we aim to inspire researchers to tackle pose estimation and tracking in extreme conditions by leveraging the advantageous of the event camera.

Poster,A benchmark for prediction of transcriptomic responses to chemical perturbations across cell types,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97655,"Artur Szałata, Andrew Benz, Robrecht Cannoodt, Mauricio Cortes, Jason Fong, Sunil Kuppasani, Richard Lieberman, Tianyu Liu, Javier Mas-Rosario, Rico Meinl, Jalil Nourisa, Jared Tumiel, Tin M. Tunjic, Mengbo Wang, Noah Weber, Hongyu Zhao, Benedict Anchang, Fabian Theis, Malte Luecken, Daniel Burkhardt","Single-cell transcriptomics has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and drug perturbation effects. However, its high cost and the vast chemical space of potential drugs present barriers to experimentally characterizing the effect of chemical perturbations in all the myriad cell types of the human body. To overcome these limitations, several groups have proposed using machine learning methods to directly predict the effect of chemical perturbations either across cell contexts or chemical space. However, advances in this field have been hindered by a lack of well-designed evaluation datasets and benchmarks. To drive innovation in perturbation modeling, the Open Problems Perturbation Prediction (OP3) benchmark introduces a framework for predicting the effects of small molecule perturbations on cell type-specific gene expression. OP3 leverages the Open Problems in Single-cell Analysis benchmarking infrastructure and is enabled by a new single-cell perturbation dataset, encompassing 146 compounds tested on human blood cells. The benchmark includes diverse data representations, evaluation metrics, and winning methods from our ""Single-cell perturbation prediction: generalizing experimental interventions to unseen contexts"" competition at NeurIPS 2023. We envision that the OP3 benchmark and competition will drive innovation in single-cell perturbation prediction by improving the accessibility, visibility, and feasibility of this challenge, thereby promoting the impact of machine learning in drug discovery."
Poster,A Benchmark Suite for Evaluating Neural Mutual Information Estimators on Unstructured Datasets,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97443,"Kyungeun Lee, Wonjong Rhee","Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental metric for quantifying dependency between two random variables. When we can access only the samples, but not the underlying distribution functions, we can evaluate MI using sample-based estimators. Assessment of such MI estimators, however, has almost always relied on analytical datasets including Gaussian multivariates. Such datasets allow analytical calculations of the true MI values, but they are limited in that they do not reflect the complexities of real-world datasets. This study introduces a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating neural MI estimators on unstructured datasets, specifically focusing on images and texts. By leveraging same-class sampling for positive pairing and introducing a binary symmetric channel trick, we show that we can accurately manipulate true MI values of real-world datasets. Using the benchmark suite, we investigate seven challenging scenarios, shedding light on the reliability of neural MI estimators for unstructured datasets."
Poster,A Best-of-both-worlds Algorithm for Bandits with Delayed Feedback with Robustness to Excessive Delays,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95613,"Saeed Masoudian, Julian Zimmert, Yevgeny Seldin","We propose a new best-of-both-worlds algorithm for bandits with variably delayed feedback. In contrast to prior work, which required prior knowledge of the maximal delay $d_{\max}$ and had a linear dependence of the regret on it, our algorithm can tolerate arbitrary excessive delays up to order $T$ (where $T$ is the time horizon). The algorithm is based on three technical innovations, which may all be of independent interest: (1) We introduce the first implicit exploration scheme that works in best-of-both-worlds setting. (2) We introduce the first control of distribution drift that does not rely on boundedness of delays. The control is based on the implicit exploration scheme and adaptive skipping of observations with excessive delays. (3) We introduce a procedure relating standard regret with drifted regret that does not rely on boundedness of delays. At the conceptual level, we demonstrate that complexity of best-of-both-worlds bandits with delayed feedback is characterized by the amount of information missing at the time of decision making (measured by the number of outstanding observations) rather than the time that the information is missing (measured by the delays)."
Poster,A Boosting-Type Convergence Result for AdaBoost.MH with Factorized Multi-Class Classifiers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96460,"Xin Zou, Zhengyu Zhou, Jingyuan Xu, Weiwei Liu","AdaBoost is a well-known algorithm in boosting. Schapire and Singer propose, an extension of AdaBoost, named AdaBoost.MH, for multi-class classification problems. Kégl shows empirically that AdaBoost.MH works better when the classical one-against-all base classifiers are replaced by factorized base classifiers containing a binary classifier and a vote (or code) vector. However, the factorization makes it much more difficult to provide a convergence result for the factorized version of AdaBoost.MH. Then, Kégl raises an open problem in COLT 2014 to look for a convergence result for the factorized AdaBoost.MH. In this work, we resolve this open problem by presenting a convergence result for AdaBoost.MH with factorized multi-class classifiers."
Poster,Abrupt Learning in Transformers: A Case Study on Matrix Completion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95388,"Pulkit Gopalani, Ekdeep S Lubana, Wei Hu","Recent analysis on the training dynamics of Transformers has unveiled an interesting characteristic: the training loss plateaus for a significant number of training steps, and then suddenly (and sharply) drops to near--optimal values. To understand this phenomenon in depth, we formulate the low-rank matrix completion problem as a masked language modeling (MLM) task, and show that it is possible to train a BERT model to solve this task to low error. Furthermore, the loss curve shows a plateau early in training followed by a sudden drop to near-optimal values, despite no changes in the training procedure or hyper-parameters. To gain interpretability insights into this sudden drop, we examine the model's predictions, attention heads, and hidden states before and after this transition. Concretely, we observe that (a) the model transitions from simply copying the masked input to accurately predicting the masked entries; (b) the attention heads transition to interpretable patterns relevant to the task; and (c) the embeddings and hidden states encode information relevant to the problem. We also analyze the training dynamics of individual model components to understand the sudden drop in loss."
Poster,Absorb & Escape: Overcoming Single Model Limitations in Generating Heterogeneous Genomic Sequences,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94782,"Zehui Li, Yuhao Ni, Guoxuan Xia, William Beardall, Akashaditya Das, Guy-Bart Stan, Yiren Zhao","Recent advances in immunology and synthetic biology have accelerated the development of deep generative methods for DNA sequence design. Two dominant approaches in this field are AutoRegressive (AR) models and Diffusion Models (DMs). However, genomic sequences are functionally heterogeneous, consisting of multiple connected regions (e.g., Promoter Regions, Exons, and Introns) where elements within each region come from the same probability distribution, but the overall sequence is non-homogeneous. This heterogeneous nature presents challenges for a single model to accurately generate genomic sequences. In this paper, we analyze the properties of AR models and DMs in heterogeneous genomic sequence generation, pointing out crucial limitations in both methods: (i) AR models capture the underlying distribution of data by factorizing and learning the transition probability but fail to capture the global property of DNA sequences. (ii) DMs learn to recover the global distribution but tend to produce errors at the base pair level. To overcome the limitations of both approaches, we propose a post-training sampling method, termed Absorb & Escape (A&E) to perform compositional generation from AR models and DMs. This approach starts with samples generated by DMs and refines the sample quality using an AR model through the alternation of the Absorb and Escape steps.  To assess the quality of generated sequences, we conduct extensive experiments on 15 species for conditional and unconditional DNA generation. The experiment results from motif distribution, diversity checks, and genome integration tests unequivocally show that A&E outperforms state-of-the-art AR models and DMs in genomic sequence generation. A&E does not suffer from the slowness of traditional MCMC to sample from composed distributions with Energy-Based Models whilst it obtains higher quality samples than single models. Our research sheds light on the limitations of current single-model approaches in DNA generation and provides a simple but effective solution for heterogeneous sequence generation.

Poster,Abstracted Shapes as Tokens - A Generalizable and Interpretable Model for Time-series Classification,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93522,"Yunshi Wen, Tengfei Ma, Lily Weng, Lam Nguyen, Anak Agung Julius","In time-series analysis, many recent works seek to provide a unified view and representation for time-series across multiple domains, leading to the development of foundation models for time-series data. Despite diverse modeling techniques, existing models are black boxes and fail to provide insights and explanations about their representations. In this paper, we present VQShape, a pre-trained, generalizable, and interpretable model for time-series representation learning and classification. By introducing a novel representation for time-series data, we forge a connection between the latent space of VQShape and shape-level features. Using vector quantization, we show that time-series from different domains can be described using a unified set of low-dimensional codes, where each code can be represented as an abstracted shape in the time domain. On classification tasks, we show that the representations of VQShape can be utilized to build interpretable classifiers, achieving comparable performance to specialist models. Additionally, in zero-shot learning, VQShape and its codebook can generalize to previously unseen datasets and domains that are not included in the pre-training process. The code and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/YunshiWen/VQShape."
Poster,Abstract Reward Processes: Leveraging State Abstraction for Consistent Off-Policy Evaluation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94409,"Shreyas Chaudhari, Ameet Deshpande, Bruno C. da Silva, Philip Thomas","Evaluating policies using off-policy data is crucial for applying reinforcement learning to real-world problems such as healthcare and autonomous driving. Previous methods for *off-policy evaluation* (OPE) generally suffer from high variance or irreducible bias, leading to unacceptably high prediction errors. In this work, we introduce STAR, a framework for OPE that encompasses a broad range of estimators -- which include existing OPE methods as special cases -- that achieve lower mean squared prediction errors. STAR leverages state abstraction to distill complex, potentially continuous problems into compact, discrete models which we call *abstract reward processes* (ARPs). Predictions from ARPs estimated from off-policy data are provably consistent (asymptotically correct). Rather than proposing a specific estimator, we present a new framework for OPE and empirically demonstrate that estimators within STAR outperform existing methods. The best STAR estimator outperforms baselines in all twelve cases studied, and even the median STAR estimator surpasses the baselines in seven out of the twelve cases."
Poster,A Canonicalization Perspective on Invariant and Equivariant Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93936,"George Ma, Yifei Wang, Derek Lim, Stefanie Jegelka, Yisen Wang","In many applications, we desire neural networks to exhibit invariance or equivariance to certain groups due to symmetries inherent in the data. Recently, frame-averaging methods emerged to be a unified framework for attaining symmetries efficiently by averaging over input-dependent subsets of the group, i.e., frames. What we currently lack is a principled understanding of the design of frames. In this work, we introduce a canonicalization perspective that provides an essential and complete view of the design of frames. Canonicalization is a classic approach for attaining invariance by mapping inputs to their canonical forms. We show that there exists an inherent connection between frames and canonical forms. Leveraging this connection, we can efficiently compare the complexity of frames as well as determine the optimality of certain frames. Guided by this principle, we design novel frames for eigenvectors that are strictly superior to existing methods --- some are even optimal --- both theoretically and empirically. The reduction to the canonicalization perspective further uncovers equivalences between previous methods. These observations suggest that canonicalization provides a fundamental understanding of existing frame-averaging methods and unifies existing equivariant and invariant learning methods.
