Poster,GS-Hider: Hiding Messages into 3D Gaussian Splatting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96740,"Xuanyu Zhang, Jiarui Meng, Runyi Li, Zhipei Xu, yongbing zhang, Jian Zhang","3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has already become the emerging research focus in the fields of 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Given that training a 3DGS requires a significant amount of time and computational cost, it is crucial to protect the copyright, integrity, and privacy of such 3D assets. Steganography, as a crucial technique for encrypted transmission and copyright protection, has been extensively studied. However, it still lacks profound exploration targeted at 3DGS. Unlike its predecessor NeRF, 3DGS possesses two distinct features: 1) explicit 3D representation; and 2) real-time rendering speeds. These characteristics result in the 3DGS point cloud files being public and transparent, with each Gaussian point having a clear physical significance. Therefore, ensuring the security and fidelity of the original 3D scene while embedding information into the 3DGS point cloud files is an extremely challenging task. To solve the above-mentioned issue, we first propose a steganography framework for 3DGS, dubbed GS-Hider, which can embed 3D scenes and images into original GS point clouds in an invisible manner and accurately extract the hidden messages. Specifically, we design a coupled secured feature attribute to replace the original 3DGS's spherical harmonics coefficients and then use a scene decoder and a message decoder to disentangle the original RGB scene and the hidden message. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed GS-Hider can effectively conceal multimodal messages without compromising rendering quality and possesses exceptional security, robustness, capacity, and flexibility.

Poster,GTA: A Benchmark for General Tool Agents,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97620,"Jize Wang, Ma Zerun, Yining Li, Songyang Zhang, Cailian Chen, Kai Chen, Xinyi Le","In developing general-purpose agents, significant focus has been placed on integrating large language models (LLMs) with various tools. This poses a challenge to the tool-use capabilities of LLMs. However, there are evident gaps between existing tool evaluations and real-world scenarios. Current evaluations often use AI-generated queries, single-step tasks, dummy tools, and text-only inputs, which fail to reveal the agents' real-world problem-solving abilities effectively. To address this, we propose GTA, a benchmark for **G**eneral **T**ool **A**gents,  featuring three main aspects: (i) *Real user queries*: human-written queries with simple real-world objectives but implicit tool-use, requiring the LLM to reason the suitable tools and plan the solution steps. (ii) *Real deployed tools*: an evaluation platform equipped with tools across perception, operation, logic, and creativity categories to evaluate the agents' actual task execution performance. (iii) *Real multimodal inputs*: authentic image files, such as spatial scenes, web page screenshots, tables, code snippets, and printed/handwritten materials, used as the query contexts to align with real-world scenarios closely. We designed 229 real-world tasks and executable tool chains to evaluate mainstream LLMs. Our findings show that real-world user queries are challenging for existing LLMs, with GPT-4 completing less than 50\% of the tasks and most LLMs achieving below 25\%. This evaluation reveals the bottlenecks in the tool-use capabilities of current LLMs in real-world scenarios, which is beneficial for the advancement of general-purpose tool agents.

Poster,GTA: Generative Trajectory Augmentation with Guidance for Offline Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93877,"Jaewoo Lee, Sujin Yun, Taeyoung Yun, Jinkyoo Park","Offline Reinforcement Learning (Offline RL) presents challenges of learning effective decision-making policies from static datasets without any online interactions. Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce GTA, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms across various tasks with unique challenges. Furthermore, we conduct a quality analysis of data augmented by GTA and demonstrate that GTA improves the quality of the data. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jaewoopudding/GTA"
Poster,GTBench: Uncovering the Strategic Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs via Game-Theoretic Evaluations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92988,"Jinhao Duan, Renming Zhang, James Diffenderfer, Bhavya Kailkhura, Lichao Sun, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal, Tianlong Chen, Kaidi Xu","As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into critical real-world applications, their strategic and logical reasoning abilities are increasingly crucial. This paper evaluates LLMs' reasoning abilities in competitive environments through game-theoretic tasks, e.g., board and card games that require pure logic and strategic reasoning to compete with opponents. We first propose GTBench, a language-driven environment composing 10 widely-recognized tasks, across a comprehensive game taxonomy: complete versus incomplete information, dynamic versus static, and probabilistic versus deterministic scenarios. Then, we (1) Characterize the game-theoretic reasoning of LLMs; and (2) Perform LLM-vs.-LLM competitions as reasoning evaluation. We observe that (1) LLMs have distinct behaviors regarding various gaming scenarios; for example, LLMs fail in complete and deterministic games yet they are competitive in probabilistic gaming scenarios; (2) Most open-source LLMs, e.g., CodeLlama-34b-Instruct and Llama-2-70b-chat, are less competitive than commercial LLMs, e.g., GPT-4, in complex games, yet the recently released Llama-3-70b-Instruct makes up for this shortcoming. In addition, code-pretraining greatly benefits strategic reasoning, while advanced reasoning methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) do not always help. We further characterize the game-theoretic properties of LLMs, such as equilibrium and Pareto Efficiency in repeated games. Detailed error profiles are provided for a better understanding of LLMs' behavior. We hope our research provides standardized protocols and serves as a foundation to spur further explorations in the strategic reasoning of LLMs."
Poster,GTSinger: A Global Multi-Technique Singing Corpus with Realistic Music Scores for All Singing Tasks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97428,"Yu Zhang, Changhao Pan, Wenxiang Guo, Ruiqi Li, Zhiyuan Zhu, Jialei Wang, Wenhao Xu, Jingyu Lu, Zhiqing Hong, Chuxin Wang, Lichao Zhang, Jinzheng He, Ziyue Jiang, Yuxin Chen, Chen Yang, Jiecheng Zhou, Xinyu Cheng, Zhou Zhao","The scarcity of high-quality and multi-task singing datasets significantly hinders the development of diverse controllable and personalized singing tasks, as existing singing datasets suffer from low quality, limited diversity of languages and singers, absence of multi-technique information and realistic music scores, and poor task suitability.To tackle these problems, we present GTSinger, a large Global, multi-Technique, free-to-use, high-quality singing corpus with realistic music scores, designed for all singing tasks, along with its benchmarks.Particularly,(1) we collect 80.59 hours of high-quality singing voices, forming the largest recorded singing dataset;(2) 20 professional singers across nine widely spoken languages offer diverse timbres and styles;(3) we provide controlled comparison and phoneme-level annotations of six commonly used singing techniques, helping technique modeling and control;(4) GTSinger offers realistic music scores, assisting real-world musical composition;(5) singing voices are accompanied by manual phoneme-to-audio alignments, global style labels, and 16.16 hours of paired speech for various singing tasks.Moreover, to facilitate the use of GTSinger, we conduct four benchmark experiments: technique-controllable singing voice synthesis, technique recognition, style transfer, and speech-to-singing conversion."
Poster,GuardT2I: Defending Text-to-Image Models from Adversarial Prompts,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95982,"Yijun Yang, Ruiyuan Gao, Xiao Yang, Jianyuan Zhong, Qiang Xu","Recent advancements in Text-to-Image models have raised significant safety concerns about their potential misuse for generating inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work contents, despite existing countermeasures such as Not-Safe-For-Work classifiers or model fine-tuning for inappropriate concept removal. Addressing this challenge, our study unveils GuardT2I a novel moderation framework that adopts a generative approach to enhance Text-to-Image models’ robustness against adversarial prompts. Instead of making a binary classification, GuardT2I utilizes a large language model to conditionally transform text guidance embeddings within the Text-to-Image models into natural language for effective adversarial prompt detection, without compromising the models’ inherent performance. Our extensive experiments reveal that GuardT2I outperforms leading commercial solutions like OpenAI-Moderation and Microsoft Azure Moderator by a significant margin across diverse adversarial scenarios.  Our framework is available at https://github.com/cure-lab/GuardT2I."
Poster,Guided Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Model-based Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93989,"Taeyoung Yun, Sujin Yun, Jaewoo Lee, Jinkyoo Park","Optimizing complex and high-dimensional black-box functions is ubiquitous in science and engineering fields. Unfortunately, the online evaluation of these functions is restricted due to time and safety constraints in most cases. In offline model-based optimization (MBO), we aim to find a design that maximizes the target function using only a pre-existing offline dataset. While prior methods consider forward or inverse approaches to address the problem, these approaches are limited by conservatism and the difficulty of learning highly multi-modal mappings. Recently, there has been an emerging paradigm of learning to improve solutions with synthetic trajectories constructed from the offline dataset. In this paper, we introduce a novel conditional generative modeling approach to produce trajectories toward high-scoring regions. First, we construct synthetic trajectories toward high-scoring regions using the dataset while injecting locality bias for consistent improvement directions. Then, we train a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories conditioned on their scores. Lastly, we sample multiple trajectories from the trained model with guidance to explore high-scoring regions beyond the dataset and select high-fidelity designs among generated trajectories with the proxy function. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms competitive baselines on Design-Bench and its practical variants.

Poster,GUIDE: Real-Time Human-Shaped Agents,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95640,"Lingyu Zhang, Zhengran Ji, Nicholas Waytowich, Boyuan Chen","The recent rapid advancement of machine learning has been driven by increasingly powerful models with the growing availability of training data and computational resources. However, real-time decision-making tasks with limited time and sparse learning signals remain challenging. One way of improving the learning speed and performance of these agents is to leverage human guidance. In this work, we introduce GUIDE, a framework for real-time human-guided reinforcement learning by enabling continuous human feedback and grounding such feedback into dense rewards to accelerate policy learning. Additionally, our method features a simulated feedback module that learns and replicates human feedback patterns in an online fashion, effectively reducing the need for human input while allowing continual training. We demonstrate the performance of our framework on challenging tasks with sparse rewards and visual observations. Our human study involving 50 subjects offers strong quantitative and qualitative evidence of the effectiveness of our approach. With only 10 minutes of human feedback, our algorithm achieves up to 30\% increase in success rate compared to its RL baseline."
Poster,Guiding a Diffusion Model with a Bad Version of Itself,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94471,"Tero Karras, Miika Aittala, Tuomas Kynkäänniemi, Jaakko Lehtinen, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine","The primary axes of interest in image-generating diffusion models are image quality, the amount of variation in the results, and how well the results align with a given condition, e.g., a class label or a text prompt. The popular classifier-free guidance approach uses an unconditional model to guide a conditional model, leading to simultaneously better prompt alignment and higher-quality images at the cost of reduced variation. These effects seem inherently entangled, and thus hard to control. We make the surprising observation that it is possible to obtain disentangled control over image quality without compromising the amount of variation by guiding generation using a smaller, less-trained version of the model itself rather than an unconditional model. This leads to significant improvements in ImageNet generation, setting record FIDs of 1.01 for 64x64 and 1.25 for 512x512, using publicly available networks. Furthermore, the method is also applicable to unconditional diffusion models, drastically improving their quality."
Poster,Guiding Neural Collapse: Optimising Towards the Nearest Simplex Equiangular Tight Frame,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92977,"Evan Markou, Thalaiyasingam Ajanthan, Stephen Gould","Neural Collapse (NC) is a recently observed phenomenon in neural networks that characterises the solution space of the final classifier layer when trained until zero training loss. Specifically, NC suggests that the final classifier layer converges to a Simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF), which maximally separates the weights corresponding to each class. By duality, the penultimate layer feature means also converge to the same simplex ETF. Since this simple symmetric structure is optimal, our idea is to utilise this property to improve convergence speed. Specifically, we introduce the notion of \textit{nearest simplex ETF geometry} for the penultimate layer features at any given training iteration, by formulating it as a Riemannian optimisation. Then, at each iteration, the classifier weights are implicitly set to the nearest simplex ETF by solving this inner-optimisation, which is encapsulated within a declarative node to allow backpropagation. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world architectures on classification tasks demonstrate that our approach accelerates convergence and enhances training stability."
