Poster,Offline Oracle-Efficient Learning for Contextual MDPs via Layerwise Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96396,"Jian Qian, Haichen Hu, David Simchi-Levi","Motivated by the recent discovery of a statistical and computational reduction from contextual bandits to offline regression \citep{simchi2020bypassing}, we address the general (stochastic) Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) problem with horizon $H$ (as known as CMDP with $H$ layers). In this paper, we introduce a reduction from CMDPs to offline density estimation under the realizability assumption, i.e., a model class $\mathcal{M}$ containing the true underlying CMDP is provided in advance. We develop an efficient, statistically near-optimal algorithm requiring only $O(H \log T)$ calls to an offline density estimation algorithm (or oracle) across all $T$ rounds. This number can be further reduced to $O(H \log \log T)$ if $T$ is known in advance. Our results mark the first efficient and near-optimal reduction from CMDPs to offline density estimation without imposing any structural assumptions on the model class. A notable feature of our algorithm is the design of a layerwise exploration-exploitation tradeoff tailored to address the layerwise structure of CMDPs. Additionally, our algorithm is versatile and applicable to pure exploration tasks in reward-free reinforcement learning."
Poster,Offline Reinforcement Learning with OOD State Correction and OOD Action Suppression,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94532,"Yixiu Mao, Qi Wang, Chen Chen, Yun Qu, Xiangyang Ji","In offline reinforcement learning (RL), addressing the out-of-distribution (OOD) action issue has been a focus, but we argue that there exists an OOD state issue that also impairs performance yet has been underexplored. Such an issue describes the scenario when the agent encounters states out of the offline dataset during the test phase, leading to uncontrolled behavior and performance degradation. To this end, we propose SCAS, a simple yet effective approach that unifies OOD state correction and OOD action suppression in offline RL. Technically, SCAS achieves value-aware OOD state correction, capable of correcting the agent from OOD states to high-value in-distribution states. Theoretical and empirical results show that SCAS also exhibits the effect of suppressing OOD actions. On standard offline RL benchmarks, SCAS achieves excellent performance without additional hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, benefiting from its OOD state correction feature, SCAS demonstrates enhanced robustness against environmental perturbations."
Poster,Off-policy estimation with adaptively collected data: the power of online learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96345,"Jeonghwan Lee, Cong Ma","We consider estimation of a linear functional of the treatment effect from adaptively collected data. This problem finds a variety of applications including off-policy evaluation in contextual bandits, and estimation of the average treatment effect in causal inference. While a certain class of augmented inverse propensity weighting (AIPW) estimators enjoys desirable asymptotic properties including the semi-parametric efficiency, much less is known about their non-asymptotic theory with adaptively collected data. To fill in the gap, we first present generic upper bounds on the mean-squared error of the class of AIPW estimators that crucially depends on a sequentially weighted error between the treatment effect and its estimates. Motivated by this, we propose a general reduction scheme that allows one to produce a sequence of estimates for the treatment effect via online learning to minimize the sequentially weighted estimation error. To illustrate this, we provide three concrete instantiations in (1) the tabular case; (2) the case of linear function approximation; and (3) the case of general function approximation for the outcome model. We then provide a local minimax lower bound to show the instance-dependent optimality of the AIPW estimator using no-regret online learning algorithms."
Poster,Off-Policy Selection for Initiating Human-Centric Experimental Design,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93365,"Ge Gao, Xi Yang, Qitong Gao, Song Ju, Miroslav Pajic, Min Chi","In human-centric applications like healthcare and education, the \textit{heterogeneity} among patients and students necessitates personalized treatments and instructional interventions. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been utilized in those tasks, off-policy selection (OPS) is pivotal to close the loop by offline evaluating and selecting policies without online interactions, yet current OPS methods often overlook the heterogeneity among participants. Our work is centered on resolving a \textit{pivotal challenge} in human-centric systems (HCSs): \textbf{\textit{how to select a policy to deploy when a new participant joining the cohort, without having access to any prior offline data collected over the participant?}} We introduce First-Glance Off-Policy Selection (FPS), a novel approach that systematically addresses participant heterogeneity through sub-group segmentation and tailored OPS criteria to each sub-group. By grouping individuals with similar traits, FPS facilitates personalized policy selection aligned with unique characteristics of each participant or group of participants. FPS is evaluated via two important but challenging applications, intelligent tutoring systems and a healthcare application for sepsis treatment and intervention. FPS presents significant advancement in enhancing learning outcomes of students and in-hospital care outcomes."
Poster,Off to new Shores: A Dataset & Benchmark for (near-)coastal Flood Inundation Forecasting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97766,"Brandon Victor, Mathilde Letard, Peter Naylor, Karim Douch, Nicolas Longepe, Zhen He, Patrick Ebel","Floods are among the most common and devastating natural hazards, imposing immense costs on our society and economy due to their disastrous consequences. Recent progress in weather prediction and spaceborne flood mapping demonstrated the feasibility of anticipating extreme events and reliably detecting their catastrophic effects afterwards. However, these efforts are rarely linked to one another and there is a critical lack of datasets and benchmarks to enable the direct forecasting of flood extent. To resolve this issue, we curate a novel dataset enabling a timely prediction of flood extent. Furthermore, we provide a representative evaluation of state-of-the-art methods, structured into two benchmark tracks for forecasting flood inundation maps i) in general and ii) focused on coastal regions.   Altogether, our dataset and benchmark provide a comprehensive platform for evaluating flood forecasts, enabling future solutions for this critical challenge.

Poster,Oja's Algorithm for Streaming Sparse PCA,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94389,"Syamantak Kumar, Purnamrita Sarkar","Oja's algorithm for Streaming Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for $n$ data-points in a $d$ dimensional space achieves the same sin-squared error $O(r_{\mathsf{eff}}/n)$ as the offline algorithm in $O(d)$ space and $O(nd)$ time and a single pass through the datapoints. Here $r_{\mathsf{eff}}$ is the effective rank (ratio of the trace and the principal eigenvalue of the population covariance matrix $\Sigma$). Under this computational budget, we consider the problem of sparse PCA, where the principal eigenvector of $\Sigma$ is $s$-sparse, and $r_{\mathsf{eff}}$ can be large. In this setting, to our knowledge, *there are no known single-pass algorithms* that achieve the minimax error bound in $O(d)$ space and $O(nd)$ time without either requiring strong initialization conditions or assuming further structure (e.g., spiked) of the covariance matrix.We show that a simple single-pass procedure that thresholds the output of Oja's algorithm (the Oja vector) can achieve the minimax error bound under some regularity conditions in $O(d)$ space and $O(nd)$ time.  We present a nontrivial and novel analysis of the entries of the unnormalized Oja vector, which involves the projection of a product of independent random matrices on a random initial vector. This is completely different from previous analyses of Oja's algorithm and matrix products, which have been done when the $r_{\mathsf{eff}}$ is bounded."
Poster,OlympicArena: Benchmarking Multi-discipline Cognitive Reasoning for Superintelligent AI,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97617,"Zhen Huang, Zengzhi Wang, Shijie Xia, Xuefeng Li, Haoyang Zou, Ruijie Xu, Run-Ze Fan, Lyumanshan Ye, Ethan Chern, Yixin Ye, Yikai Zhang, Yuqing Yang, Ting Wu, Binjie Wang, Shichao Sun, Yang Xiao, Yiyuan Li, Fan Zhou, Steffi Chern, Yiwei Qin, Yan Ma, Jiadi Su, Yixiu Liu, Yuxiang Zheng, Shaoting Zhang, Dahua Lin, Yu Qiao, Pengfei Liu","The evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been significantly accelerated by advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), gradually showcasing potential cognitive reasoning abilities in problem-solving and scientific discovery (i.e., AI4Science) once exclusive to human intellect. To comprehensively evaluate current models' performance in cognitive reasoning abilities, we introduce OlympicArena, which includes 11,163 bilingual problems across both text-only and interleaved text-image modalities. These challenges encompass a wide range of disciplines spanning seven fields and 62 international Olympic competitions, rigorously examined for data leakage. We argue that the challenges in Olympic competition problems are ideal for evaluating AI's cognitive reasoning due to their complexity and interdisciplinary nature, which are essential for tackling complex scientific challenges and facilitating discoveries. Beyond evaluating performance across various disciplines using answer-only criteria, we conduct detailed experiments and analyses from multiple perspectives. We delve into the models' cognitive reasoning abilities, their performance across different modalities, and their outcomes in process-level evaluations, which are vital for tasks requiring complex reasoning with lengthy solutions. Our extensive evaluations reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4o only achieve a 39.97\%  overall accuracy (28.67\%  for mathematics and 29.71\%  for physics), illustrating current AI limitations in complex reasoning and multimodal integration. Through the OlympicArena, we aim to advance AI towards superintelligence, equipping it to address more complex challenges in science and beyond. We also provide a comprehensive set of resources to support AI research, including a benchmark dataset, an open-source annotation platform, a detailed evaluation tool, and a leaderboard with automatic submission features."
Poster,"OMG-LLaVA: Bridging Image-level, Object-level, Pixel-level Reasoning and Understanding",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94820,"Tao Zhang, Xiangtai Li, Hao Fei, Haobo Yuan, Shengqiong Wu, Shunping Ji, Chen Change Loy, Shuicheng Yan","Current universal segmentation methods demonstrate strong capabilities in pixel-level image and video understanding. However, they lack reasoning abilities and cannot be controlled via text instructions. In contrast, large vision-language multimodal models exhibit powerful vision-based conversation and reasoning capabilities but lack pixel-level understanding and have difficulty accepting visual prompts for flexible user interaction. This paper proposes OMG-LLaVA, a new and elegant framework combining powerful pixel-level vision understanding with reasoning abilities. It can accept various visual and text prompts for flexible user interaction. Specifically, we use a universal segmentation method as the visual encoder, integrating image information, perception priors, and visual prompts into visual tokens provided to the LLM. The LLM is responsible for understanding the user's text instructions and providing text responses and pixel-level segmentation results based on the visual information. We propose perception prior embedding to better integrate perception priors with image features. OMG-LLaVA achieves image-level, object-level, and pixel-level reasoning and understanding in a single model, matching or surpassing the performance of specialized methods on multiple benchmarks. Rather than using LLM to connect each specialist, our work aims at end-to-end training on one encoder, one decoder, and one LLM. The code and model have been released for further research."
Poster,Omnigrasp: Grasping Diverse Objects with Simulated Humanoids,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95880,"Zhengyi Luo, Jinkun Cao, Sammy Christen, Alexander Winkler, Kris Kitani, Weipeng Xu","We present a method for controlling a simulated humanoid to grasp an object and move it to follow an object's trajectory. Due to the challenges in controlling a humanoid with dexterous hands, prior methods often use a disembodied hand and only consider vertical lifts or short trajectories. This limited scope hampers their applicability for object manipulation required for animation and simulation. To close this gap, we learn a controller that can pick up a large number (>1200) of objects and carry them to follow randomly generated trajectories. Our key insight is to leverage a humanoid motion representation that provides human-like motor skills and significantly speeds up training. Using only simplistic reward, state, and object representations, our method shows favorable scalability on diverse objects and trajectories. For training, we do not need a dataset of paired full-body motion and object trajectories. At test time, we only require the object mesh and desired trajectories for grasping and transporting. To demonstrate the capabilities of our method, we show state-of-the-art success rates in following object trajectories and generalizing to unseen objects. Code and models will be released."
Poster,OmniJARVIS: Unified Vision-Language-Action Tokenization Enables Open-World Instruction Following Agents,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94404,"Zihao Wang, Shaofei Cai, Zhancun Mu, Haowei Lin, Ceyao Zhang, Xuejie Liu, Qing Li, Anji Liu, Xiaojian (Shawn) Ma, Yitao Liang","This paper presents OmniJARVIS, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for open-world instruction-following agents in Minecraft. Compared to prior works that either emit textual goals to separate controllers or produce the control command directly, OmniJARVIS seeks a different path to ensure both strong reasoning and efficient decision-making capabilities via unified tokenization of multimodal interaction data. First, we introduce a self-supervised approach to learn a behavior encoder that produces discretized tokens for behavior trajectories $\tau = \{o_0, a_0, \dots\}$ and an imitation learning policy decoder conditioned on these tokens. These additional behavior tokens will be augmented to the vocabulary of pretrained Multimodal Language Models. With this encoder, we then pack long-term multimodal interactions involving task instructions, memories, thoughts, observations, textual responses, behavior trajectories, etc into unified token sequences and model them with autoregressive transformers. Thanks to the semantically meaningful behavior tokens, the resulting VLA model, OmniJARVIS, can reason (by producing chain-of-thoughts), plan, answer questions, and act (by producing behavior tokens for the imitation learning policy decoder). OmniJARVIS demonstrates excellent performances on a comprehensive collection of atomic, programmatic, and open-ended tasks in open-world Minecraft. Our analysis further unveils the crucial design principles in interaction data formation, unified tokenization, and its scaling potentials. The dataset, models, and code will be released at https://craftjarvis.org/OmniJARVIS."
