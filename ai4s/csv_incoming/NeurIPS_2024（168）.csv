Poster,Generated and Pseudo Content guided Prototype Refinement for Few-shot Point Cloud Segmentation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95048,"Lili Wei, Congyan Lang, Ziyi Chen, Tao Wang, Yidong Li, Jun Liu","Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation aims to segment query point clouds with only a few annotated support point clouds. Existing prototype-based methods learn prototypes from the 3D support set to guide the segmentation of query point clouds. However, they encounter the challenge of low prototype quality due to constrained semantic information in the 3D support set and class information bias between support and query sets. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel framework called Generated and Pseudo Content guided Prototype Refinement (GPCPR), which explicitly leverages LLM-generated content and reliable query context to enhance prototype quality. GPCPR achieves prototype refinement through two core components: LLM-driven Generated Content-guided Prototype Refinement (GCPR) and Pseudo Query Context-guided Prototype Refinement (PCPR). Specifically, GCPR integrates diverse and differentiated class descriptions generated by large language models to enrich prototypes with comprehensive semantic knowledge. PCPR further aggregates reliable class-specific pseudo-query context to mitigate class information bias and generate more suitable query-specific prototypes. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-distillation regularization term, enabling knowledge transfer between early-stage entities (prototypes or pseudo predictions) and their deeper counterparts to enhance refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by up to 12.10% and 13.75% mIoU on S3DIS and ScanNet, respectively."
Poster,Generate Universal Adversarial Perturbations for Few-Shot Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95241,"Yiman Hu, Yixiong Zou, Ruixuan Li, Yuhua Li","Deep networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples which are deliberately designed to mislead the trained model by introducing imperceptible perturbations to input samples. Compared to traditional perturbations crafted specifically for each data point, Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) are input-agnostic and shown to be more practical in the real world. However, UAPs are typically generated in a close-set scenario that shares the same classification task during the training and testing phases. This paper demonstrates the ineffectiveness of traditional UAPs in open-set scenarios like Few-Shot Learning (FSL). Through analysis, we identify two primary challenges that hinder the attacking process: the task shift and the semantic shift. To enhance the transferability of UAPs in FSL, we propose a unifying attacking framework addressing these two shifts. The task shift is addressed by aligning proxy tasks to the downstream tasks, while the semantic shift is handled by leveraging the generalizability of pre-trained encoders.The proposed Few-Shot Attacking FrameWork, denoted as FSAFW, can effectively generate UAPs across various FSL training paradigms and different downstream tasks. Our approach not only sets a new standard for state-of-the-art works but also significantly enhances attack performance, exceeding the baseline method by over 16\%."
Poster,Generating Code World Models with Large Language Models Guided by Monte Carlo Tree Search,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96309,"Nicola Dainese, Matteo Merler, Minttu Alakuijala, Pekka Marttinen","In this work we consider Code World Models, world models generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) in the form of Python code for model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). Calling code instead of LLMs for planning has potential to be more precise, reliable, interpretable, and extremely efficient.However, writing appropriate Code World Models requires the ability to understand complex instructions, to generate exact code with non-trivial logic and to self-debug a long program with feedback from unit tests and environment trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose Generate, Improve and Fix with Monte Carlo Tree Search (GIF-MCTS), a new code generation strategy for LLMs. To test our approach in an offline RL setting, we introduce the Code World Models Benchmark (CWMB), a suite of program synthesis and planning tasks comprised of 18 diverse RL environments paired with corresponding textual descriptions and curated trajectories. GIF-MCTS surpasses all baselines on the CWMB and two other benchmarks, and we show that the Code World Models synthesized with it can be successfully used for planning, resulting in model-based RL agents with greatly improved sample efficiency and inference speed."
Poster,Generating compositional scenes via Text-to-image RGBA Instance Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95481,"Alessandro Fontanella, Petru-Daniel Tudosiu, Yongxin Yang, Shifeng Zhang, Sarah Parisot","Text-to-image diffusion generative models can generate high quality images at the cost of tedious prompt engineering. Controllability can be improved by introducing layout conditioning, however existing methods lack layout editing ability and fine-grained control over object attributes. The concept of multi-layer generation holds great potential to address these limitations, however generating image instances concurrently to scene composition limits control over fine-grained object attributes, relative positioning in 3D space and scene manipulation abilities. In this work, we propose a novel multi-stage generation paradigm that is designed for fine-grained control, flexibility and interactivity. To ensure control over instance attributes, we devise a novel training paradigm to adapt a diffusion model to generate isolated scene components as RGBA images with transparency information. To build complex images, we employ these pre-generated instances and introduce a multi-layer composite generation process that smoothly assembles components in realistic scenes. Our experiments show that our RGBA diffusion model is capable of generating diverse and high quality instances with precise control over object attributes. Through multi-layer composition, we demonstrate that our approach allows to build and manipulate images from highly complex prompts with fine-grained control over object appearance and location, granting a higher degree of control than competing methods."
Poster,Generating Highly Designable Proteins with Geometric Algebra Flow Matching,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93710,"Simon Wagner, Leif Seute, Vsevolod Viliuga, Nicolas Wolf, Frauke Gräter, Jan Stühmer","We introduce a generative model for protein backbone design utilizing geometric products and higher order message passing. In particular, we propose Clifford Frame Attention (CFA), an extension of the invariant point attention (IPA) architecture from AlphaFold2, in which the backbone residue frames and geometric features are represented in the projective geometric algebra. This enables to construct geometrically expressive messages between residues, including higher order terms, using the bilinear operations of the algebra. We evaluate our architecture by incorporating it into the framework of FrameFlow, a state-of-the-art flow matching model for protein backbone generation. The proposed model achieves high designability, diversity and novelty, while also sampling protein backbones that follow the statistical distribution of secondary structure elements found in naturally occurring proteins, a property so far only insufficiently achieved by many state-of-the-art generative models."
Poster,Generating Origin-Destination Matrices in Neural Spatial Interaction Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94266,"Ioannis Zachos, Mark Girolami, Theodoros Damoulas","Agent-based models (ABMs) are proliferating as decision-making tools across policy areas in transportation, economics, and epidemiology. In these models, a central object of interest is the discrete origin-destination matrix which captures spatial interactions and agent trip counts between locations. Existing approaches resort to continuous approximations of this matrix and subsequent ad-hoc discretisations in order to perform ABM simulation and calibration. This impedes conditioning on partially observed summary statistics, fails to explore the multimodal matrix distribution over a discrete combinatorial support, and incurs discretisation errors. To address these challenges, we introduce a computationally efficient framework that scales linearly with the number of origin-destination pairs, operates directly on the discrete combinatorial space, and learns the agents' trip intensity through a neural differential equation that embeds spatial interactions. Our approach outperforms the prior art in terms of reconstruction error and ground truth matrix coverage, at a fraction of the computational cost. We demonstrate these benefits in two large-scale spatial mobility ABMs in Washington, DC and Cambridge, UK."
Poster,Generative Adversarial Model-Based Optimization via Source Critic Regularization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96744,"Michael Yao, Yimeng Zeng, Hamsa Bastani, Jacob Gardner, James Gee, Osbert Bastani","Offline model-based optimization seeks to optimize against a learned surrogate model without querying the true oracle objective function during optimization. Such tasks are commonly encountered in protein design, robotics, and clinical medicine where evaluating the oracle function is prohibitively expensive. However, inaccurate surrogate model predictions are frequently encountered along offline optimization trajectories. To address this limitation, we propose *generative adversarial model-based optimization* using **adaptive source critic regularization (aSCR)**—a task- and optimizer- agnostic framework for constraining the optimization trajectory to regions of the design space where the surrogate function is reliable. We propose a computationally tractable algorithm to dynamically adjust the strength of this constraint, and show how leveraging aSCR with standard Bayesian optimization outperforms existing methods on a suite of offline generative design tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/michael-s-yao/gabo."
Poster,Generative Forests,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94417,"Richard Nock, Mathieu Guillame-Bert","We focus on generative AI for a type of data that still represent one of the most prevalent form of data: tabular data. We introduce a new powerful class of forest-based models fit for such tasks and a simple training algorithm with strong convergence guarantees in a boosting model that parallels that of the original weak / strong supervised learning setting. This algorithm can be implemented by a few tweaks to the most popular induction scheme for decision tree induction (*i.e. supervised learning*) with two classes. Experiments on the quality of generated data display substantial improvements compared to the state of the art. The losses our algorithm minimize and the structure of our models make them practical for related tasks that require fast estimation of a density given a generative model and an observation (even partially specified): such tasks include missing data imputation and density estimation. Additional experiments on these tasks reveal that our models can be notably good contenders to diverse state of the art methods, relying on models as diverse as (or mixing elements of) trees, neural nets, kernels or graphical models."
Poster,Generative Fractional Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96210,"Gabriel Nobis, Maximilian Springenberg, Marco Aversa, Michael Detzel, Rembert Daems, Roderick Murray-Smith, Shinichi Nakajima, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Stefano Ermon, Tolga Birdal, Manfred Opper, Christoph Knochenhauer, Luis Oala, Wojciech Samek","We introduce the first continuous-time score-based generative model that leverages fractional diffusion processes for its underlying dynamics. Although diffusion models have excelled at capturing data distributions, they still suffer from various limitations such as slow convergence, mode-collapse on imbalanced data, and lack of diversity. These issues are partially linked to the use of light-tailed Brownian motion (BM) with independent increments. In this paper, we replace BM with an approximation of its non-Markovian counterpart, fractional Brownian motion (fBM), characterized by correlated increments and Hurst index $H \in (0,1)$, where $H=0.5$ recovers the classical BM. To ensure tractable inference and learning, we employ a recently popularized Markov approximation of fBM (MA-fBM) and derive its reverse-time model, resulting in *generative fractional diffusion models* (GFDM). We characterize the forward dynamics using a continuous reparameterization trick and propose *augmented score matching* to efficiently learn the score function, which is partly known in closed form, at minimal added cost. The ability to drive our diffusion model via MA-fBM offers flexibility and control. $H \leq 0.5$ enters the regime of *rough paths* whereas $H>0.5$ regularizes diffusion paths and invokes long-term memory. The Markov approximation allows added control by varying the number of Markov processes linearly combined to approximate fBM. Our evaluations on real image datasets demonstrate that GFDM achieves greater pixel-wise diversity and enhanced image quality, as indicated by a lower FID, offering a promising alternative to traditional diffusion models"
Poster,Generative Hierarchical Materials Search,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95278,"Sherry Yang, Simon Batzner, Ruiqi Gao, Muratahan Aykol, Alexander Gaunt, Brendan C McMorrow, Danilo Jimenez Rezende, Dale Schuurmans, Igor Mordatch, Ekin Dogus Cubuk","Generative models trained at scale can now produce novel text, video, and more recently, scientific data such as crystal structures. The ultimate goal for materials discovery, however, goes beyond generation: we desire a fully automated system that proposes, generates, and verifies crystal structures given a high-level user instruction. In this work, we formulate end-to-end language-to-structure generation as a multi-objective optimization problem, and propose Generative Hierarchical Materials Search (GenMS) for controllable generation of crystal structures. GenMS consists of (1) a language model that takes high-level natural language as input and generates intermediate textual information about a crystal (e.g., chemical formulae), and (2) a diffusion model that takes intermediate information as input and generates low-level continuous value crystal structures. GenMS additionally uses a graph neural network to predict properties (e.g., formation energy) from the generated crystal structures. During inference, GenMS leverages all three components to conduct a forward tree search over the space of possible structures. Experiments show that GenMS outperforms other alternatives both in satisfying user request and in generating low-energy structures. GenMS is able to generate complex structures such as double perovskites (or elpasolites), layered structures, and spinels, solely from natural language input."
