Poster,Quantifying Aleatoric Uncertainty of the Treatment Effect: A Novel Orthogonal Learner,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95190,"Valentyn Melnychuk, Stefan Feuerriegel, Mihaela van der Schaar","Estimating causal quantities from observational data is crucial for understanding the safety and effectiveness of medical treatments. However, to make reliable inferences, medical practitioners require not only estimating averaged causal quantities, such as the conditional average treatment effect, but also understanding the randomness of the treatment effect as a random variable. This randomness is referred to as aleatoric uncertainty and is necessary for understanding the probability of benefit from treatment or quantiles of the treatment effect. Yet, the aleatoric uncertainty of the treatment effect has received surprisingly little attention in the causal machine learning community. To fill this gap, we aim to quantify the aleatoric uncertainty of the treatment effect at the covariate-conditional level, namely, the conditional distribution of the treatment effect (CDTE). Unlike average causal quantities, the CDTE is not point identifiable without strong additional assumptions. As a remedy, we employ partial identification to obtain sharp bounds on the CDTE and thereby quantify the aleatoric uncertainty of the treatment effect. We then develop a novel, orthogonal learner for the bounds on the CDTE, which we call AU-learner. We further show that our AU-learner has several strengths in that it satisfies Neyman-orthogonality and, thus, quasi-oracle efficiency. Finally, we propose a fully-parametric deep learning instantiation of our AU-learner."
Poster,Quantifying and Optimizing Global Faithfulness in Persona-driven Role-playing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94451,"Letian Peng, Jingbo Shang","Persona-driven role-playing (PRP) aims to build AI characters that can respond to user queries by faithfully sticking with \emph{all} (factual) statements in persona documents.Unfortunately, existing faithfulness criteria for PRP are limited to coarse-grained LLM-based scoring without a clear definition or formulation.This paper presents a pioneering exploration to quantify PRP faithfulness evaluation as a fine-grained and explainable criterion, which also serves as a reliable reference for faithfulness optimization.Our criterion first discriminates persona statements into \emph{active} and \emph{passive} constraints by identifying the query-statement relevance.Then, we incorporate all constraints following the principle that the AI character's response should be (a) entailed by active constraints and (b) not contradicted by passive constraints.We translate this principle mathematically into a novel Active-Passive-Constraint (APC) score, a constraint-wise sum of statement-to-response natural language inference (NLI) scores weighted by constraint-query relevance scores. In practice, we build the APC scoring system by symbolically distilling small NLI and relevance discriminators (300M parameters) from GPT-4 for efficiency, and both show high consistency with GPT-4's discrimination.We validate the quality of the APC score against human evaluation based on example personas with tens of statements, and the results show a high correlation.As the APC score could faithfully reflect the PRP quality, we further leverage it as a reward system in direct preference optimization (DPO) for better AI characters. Our experiments offer a fine-grained and explainable comparison between existing PRP techniques, revealing their advantages and limitations.We further find APC-based DPO to be one of the most competitive techniques for sticking with all constraints and can be well incorporated with other techniques.We then extend the scale of the experiments to real persons with hundreds of statements and reach a consistent conclusion. Finally, we provide comprehensive analyses and case studies to support the effectiveness of APC and APC-based DPO."
Poster,Quantifying the Gain in Weak-to-Strong Generalization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95474,"Moses Charikar, Chirag Pabbaraju, Kirankumar Shiragur","Recent advances in large language models have shown capabilities that are extraordinary and near-superhuman. These models operate with such complexity that reliably evaluating and aligning them proves challenging for humans. This leads to the natural question: can guidance from weak models (like humans) adequately direct the capabilities of strong models? In a recent and somewhat surprising work, Burns et al. (2023) empirically demonstrated that when strong models (like GPT-4) are finetuned using labels generated by weak supervisors (like GPT-2), the strong models outperform their weaker counterparts---a phenomenon they term *weak-to-strong generalization*.In this work, we present a theoretical framework for understanding weak-to-strong generalization. Specifically, we show that the improvement in performance achieved by strong models over their weaker counterparts is quantified by the *misfit error* incurred by the strong model on labels generated by the weaker model. Our theory reveals several curious algorithmic insights. For instance, we can predict the amount by which the strong model will improve over the weak model, and also choose among different weak models to train the strong model, based on its misfit error. We validate our theoretical findings through various empirical assessments."
Poster,Quantitative Convergences of Lie Group Momentum Optimizers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96800,"Lingkai Kong, Molei Tao","Explicit, momentum-based dynamics that optimize functions defined on Lie groups can be constructed via variational optimization and momentum trivialization. Structure preserving time discretizations can then turn this dynamics into optimization algorithms. This article investigates two types of discretization, Lie Heavy-Ball, which is a known splitting scheme, and Lie NAG-SC, which is newly proposed. Their convergence rates are explicitly quantified under $L$-smoothness and \emph{local} strong convexity assumptions. Lie NAG-SC provides acceleration over the momentumless case, i.e. Riemannian gradient descent, but Lie Heavy-Ball does not. When compared to existing accelerated optimizers for general manifolds, both Lie Heavy-Ball and Lie NAG-SC are computationally cheaper and easier to implement, thanks to their utilization of group structure. Only gradient oracle and exponential map are required, but not logarithm map or parallel transport which are computational costly."
Poster,Quantum algorithm for large-scale market equilibrium computation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96944,"Po-Wei Huang, Patrick Rebentrost","Classical algorithms for market equilibrium computation such as proportional response dynamics face scalability issues with Internet-based applications such as auctions, recommender systems, and fair division, despite having an almost linear runtime in terms of the product of buyers and goods. In this work, we provide the first quantum algorithm for market equilibrium computation with sub-linear performance. Our algorithm provides a polynomial runtime speedup in terms of the product of the number of buyers and goods while reaching the same optimization objective value as the classical algorithm. Numerical simulations of a system with 16384 buyers and goods support our theoretical results that our quantum algorithm provides a significant speedup."
Poster,Quantum Algorithms for Non-smooth Non-convex Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93117,"Chengchang Liu, Chaowen Guan, Jianhao He, John C. S. Lui","This paper considers the problem for finding the  $(\delta,\epsilon)$-Goldstein stationary point of Lipschitz continuous objective, which is a rich function class to cover a great number of important applications. We construct a novel zeroth-order quantum estimator for the gradient of the smoothed surrogate. Based on such estimator, we propose a novel quantum algorithm  that achieves a query complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-3})$ on the stochastic function value oracle, where $d$ is the dimension of the problem. We also enhance the query complexity to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-7/3})$ by introducing a variance reduction variant. Our findings demonstrate the clear advantages of utilizing quantum techniques for non-convex non-smooth optimization, as they outperform the optimal classical methods on the dependency of $\epsilon$ by a factor of $\epsilon^{-2/3}$."
Poster,Quantum Deep Equilibrium Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96140,"Philipp Schleich, Marta Skreta, Lasse Kristensen, Rodrigo Vargas-Hernandez, Alan Aspuru-Guzik","The feasibility of variational quantum algorithms, the most popular correspondent of neural networks on noisy, near-term quantum hardware, is highly impacted by the circuit depth of the involved parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs). Higher depth increases expressivity, but also results in a detrimental accumulation of errors.  Furthermore, the number of parameters involved in the PQC significantly influences the performance through the necessary number of measurements to evaluate gradients, which scales linearly with the number of parameters.   Motivated by this, we look at deep equilibrium models (DEQs), which mimic an infinite-depth, weight-tied network using a fraction of the memory by employing a root solver to find the fixed points of the network. In this work, we present Quantum Deep Equilibrium Models (QDEQs): a training paradigm that learns parameters of a quantum machine learning model given by a PQC using DEQs. To our knowledge, no work has yet explored the application of DEQs to QML models. We apply QDEQs to find the parameters of a quantum circuit in two settings: the first involves classifying MNIST-4 digits with 4 qubits; the second extends it to 10 classes of MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR.  We find that QDEQ is not only  competitive with comparable existing baseline models, but also achieves higher performance than a network with 5 times more layers. This demonstrates that the QDEQ paradigm can be used to develop significantly more shallow quantum circuits for a given task, something which is essential for the utility of near-term quantum computers.

Poster,QuaRot: Outlier-Free 4-Bit Inference in Rotated LLMs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94328,"Saleh Ashkboos, Amirkeivan Mohtashami, Maximilian Croci, Bo Li, Pashmina Cameron, Martin Jaggi, Dan Alistarh, Torsten Hoefler, James Hensman","We introduce QuaRot, a new Quantization scheme based on Rotations, which is able to quantize LLMs end-to-end, including all weights, activations, and KV cache in 4 bits. QuaRot rotates LLMs in a way that removes outliers from the hidden state without changing the output, making quantization easier. This computational invariance is applied to the hidden state (residual) of the LLM, as well as to the activations of the feed-forward components, aspects of the attention mechanism, and to the KV cache. The result is a quantized model where all matrix multiplications are performed in 4 bits, without any channels identified for retention in higher precision. Our 4-bit quantized LLAMA2-70B model has losses of at most 0.47 WikiText-2 perplexity and retains 99% of the zero-shot performance. We also show that QuaRot can provide lossless 6 and 8 bit LLAMA-2 models without any calibration data using round-to-nearest quantization. Code is available at github.com/spcl/QuaRot."
Poster,Quasi-Bayes meets Vines,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94131,"David Huk, Yuanhe Zhang, Ritabrata Dutta, Mark Steel","Recently developed quasi-Bayesian (QB) methods \cite{fong2023martingale}  proposed a stimulating change of paradigm in Bayesian computation by directly constructing the Bayesian predictive distribution through recursion, removing the need for expensive computations involved in sampling the Bayesian posterior distribution. This has proved to be data-efficient for univariate predictions, however, existing constructions for higher dimensional densities are only possible by relying on restrictive assumptions on the model's multivariate structure. Here, we propose a wholly different approach to extend Quasi-Bayesian prediction to high dimensions through the use of Sklar's theorem, by decomposing the predictive distribution into one-dimensional predictive marginals and a high-dimensional copula. We use the efficient recursive QB construction for the one-dimensional marginals and model the dependence using highly expressive vine copulas. Further, we tune hyperparameters using robust divergences (eg. energy score) and show that our proposed Quasi-Bayesian Vine (QB-Vine) is a fully non-parametric density estimator with \emph{an analytical form} and convergence rate independent of the dimension of the data in some situations. Our experiments illustrate that the QB-Vine is appropriate for high dimensional distributions ($\sim$64), needs very few samples to train ($\sim$200) and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with analytical forms for density estimation and supervised tasks by a considerable margin."
Poster,QUEEN: QUantized Efficient ENcoding of Dynamic Gaussians for Streaming Free-viewpoint Videos,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96406,"Sharath Girish, Tianye Li, Amrita Mazumdar, Abhinav Shrivastava, david luebke, Shalini De Mello","Online free-viewpoint video (FVV) streaming is a challenging problem, which is relatively under-explored. It requires incremental on-the-fly updates to a volumetric representation, fast training and rendering to satisfy realtime constraints and a small memory footprint for efficient transmission. If acheived, it can enhance user experience by enabling novel applications, e.g., 3D video conferencing and live volumetric video broadcast, among others. In this work, we propose a novel framework for QUantized and Efficient ENcoding (QUEEN) for streaming FVV using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS). QUEEN directly learns Gaussian attribute residuals between consecutive frames at each time-step without imposing any structural constraints on them, allowing for high quality reconstruction and generalizability. To efficiently store the residuals, we further propose a quantization-sparsity framework, which contains a learned latent-decoder for effectively quantizing attribute residuals other than Gaussian positions and a learned gating module to sparsify position residuals. We propose to use the Gaussian viewspace gradient difference vector as a signal to separate the static and dynamic content of the scene. It acts as a guide for effective sparsity learning and speeds up training. On diverse FVV benchmarks, QUEEN outperforms the state-of-the-art online FVV methods on all metrics. Notably, for several highly dynamic scenes, it reduces the model size to just 0.7 MB per frame while training in under 5 sec and rendering at ~350 FPS."
