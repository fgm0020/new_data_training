Poster,A Careful Examination of Large Language Model Performance on Grade School Arithmetic,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97687,"Hugh Zhang, Jeff Da, Dean Lee, Vaughn Robinson, Catherine Wu, William Song, Tiffany Zhao, Pranav Raja, Charlotte Zhuang, Dylan Slack, Qin Lyu, Sean Hendryx, Russell Kaplan, Michele Lunati, Summer Yue","Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success on many benchmarks for mathematical reasoning.However, there is growing concern that some of this performance actually reflects dataset contamination, where data closely resembling benchmark questions leaks into the training data, instead of true reasoning ability.To investigate this claim rigorously, we commission Grade School Math 1000 (GSM1k). GSM1k is designed to mirror the style and complexity of the established GSM8k benchmark,the gold standard for measuring elementary mathematical reasoning. We ensure that the two benchmarks are comparable across important metrics such as human solve rates, number of steps in solution, answer magnitude, and more.When evaluating leading open- and closed-source LLMs on GSM1k, we observe accuracy drops of up to 8%, with several families of models showing evidence of systematic overfitting across almost all model sizes.Further analysis suggests a positive relationship (Spearman's r^2=0.36) between a model's probability of generating an example from GSM8k and its performance gap between GSM8k and GSM1k, suggesting that some models may have partially memorized GSM8k.Nevertheless, many models, especially those on the frontier, show minimal signs of overfitting, and all models broadly demonstrate generalization to novel math problems guaranteed to not be in their training data."
Poster,A Cat Is A Cat (Not A Dog!): Unraveling Information Mix-ups in Text-to-Image Encoders through Causal Analysis and Embedding Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94705,"Chieh-Yun Chen, Chiang Tseng, Li-Wu Tsao, Hong-Han Shuai","This paper analyzes the impact of causal manner in the text encoder of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, which can lead to information bias and loss. Previous works have focused on addressing the issues through the denoising process. However, there is no research discussing how text embedding contributes to T2I models, especially when generating more than one object. In this paper, we share a comprehensive analysis of text embedding: i) how text embedding contributes to the generated images and ii) why information gets lost and biases towards the first-mentioned object. Accordingly, we propose a simple but effective text embedding balance optimization method, which is training-free, with an improvement of 125.42\% on information balance in stable diffusion. Furthermore, we propose a new automatic evaluation metric that quantifies information loss more accurately than existing methods, achieving 81\% concordance with human assessments. This metric effectively measures the presence and accuracy of objects, addressing the limitations of current distribution scores like CLIP's text-image similarities."
Poster,Accelerated Regularized Learning in Finite N-Person Games,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93826,"Kyriakos Lotidis, Angeliki Giannou, Panayotis Mertikopoulos, Nicholas Bambos","Motivated by the success of Nesterov's accelerated gradient algorithm for convex minimization problems, we examine whether it is possible to achieve similar performance gains in the context of online learning in games.To that end, we introduce a family of accelerated learning methods, which we call “follow the accelerated leader” (FTXL), and which incorporates the use of momentum within the general framework of regularized learning - and, in particular, the exponential / multiplicative weights algorithm and its variants.Drawing inspiration and techniques from the continuous-time analysis of Nesterov's algorithm, we show that FTXL converges locally to strict Nash equilibria at a superlinear rate, achieving in this way an exponential speed-up over vanilla regularized learning methods (which, by comparison, converge to strict equilibria at a geometric, linear rate).Importantly, the FTXL maintains its superlinear convergence rate in a broad range of feedback structures, from deterministic, full information models to stochastic, realization-based ones, and even bandit, payoff-based information, where players are only able to observe their individual realized payoffs."
Poster,Accelerating Augmentation Invariance Pretraining,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94817,"Jinhong Lin, Cheng-En Wu, Yibing Wei, Pedro Morgado","Our work tackles the computational challenges of contrastive learning methods, particularly for the pretraining of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Despite the effectiveness of contrastive learning, the substantial computational resources required for training often hinder their practical application. To mitigate this issue, we propose an acceleration framework, leveraging ViT's unique ability to generalize across inputs of varying sequence lengths. Our method employs a mix of sequence compression strategies, including randomized token dropout and flexible patch scaling, to reduce the cost of gradient estimation and accelerate convergence. We further provide an in-depth analysis of the gradient estimation error of various acceleration strategies as well as their impact on downstream tasks, offering valuable insights into the trade-offs between acceleration and performance.     We also propose a novel procedure to identify an optimal acceleration schedule to adjust the sequence compression ratios to the training progress, ensuring efficient training without sacrificing downstream performance. Our approach significantly reduces computational overhead across various self-supervised learning algorithms on large-scale datasets. In ImageNet, our method achieves speedups of 4$\times$ in MoCo, 3.3$\times$ in SimCLR, and 2.5$\times$ in DINO, demonstrating substantial efficiency gains."
Poster,Accelerating Blockwise Parallel Language Models with Draft Refinement,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95661,"Taehyeon Kim, Ananda Theertha Suresh, Kishore Papineni, Michael D Riley, Sanjiv Kumar, Adrian Benton","Autoregressive language models have achieved remarkable advancements, yet their potential is often limited by the slow inference speeds associated with sequential token generation. Blockwise parallel decoding (BPD) was proposed by Stern et al. [42] as a method to improve inference speed of language models by simultaneously predicting multiple future tokens, termed block drafts, which are subsequently verified by the autoregressive model. This paper advances the understanding and improvement of block drafts in two ways. First, we analyze token distributions generated across multiple prediction heads. Second, leveraging these insights, we propose algorithms to improve BPD inference speed by refining the block drafts using task-independent \ngram and neural language models as lightweight rescorers. Experiments demonstrate that by refining block drafts of open-sourced Vicuna and Medusa LLMs, the mean accepted token length are increased by 5-25% relative. This results in over a 3x speedup in wall clock time compared to standard autoregressive decoding in open-source 7B and 13B LLMs."
Poster,Accelerating Diffusion Models with Parallel Sampling: Inference at Sub-Linear Time Complexity,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95999,"Haoxuan Chen, Yinuo Ren, Lexing Ying, Grant Rotskoff","Diffusion models have become a leading method for generative modeling of both image and scientific data.As these models are costly to train and \emph{evaluate}, reducing the inference cost for diffusion models remains a major goal.Inspired by the recent empirical success in accelerating diffusion models via the parallel sampling technique~\cite{shih2024parallel}, we propose to divide the sampling process into $\mathcal{O}(1)$ blocks with parallelizable Picard iterations within each block. Rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that our algorithm achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathrm{poly} \log d)$ overall time complexity, marking \emph{the first implementation with provable sub-linear complexity w.r.t. the data dimension $d$}. Our analysis is based on a generalized version of Girsanov's theorem and is compatible with both the SDE and probability flow ODE implementations. Our results shed light on the potential of fast and efficient sampling of high-dimensional data on fast-evolving modern large-memory GPU clusters."
Poster,Accelerating ERM for data-driven algorithm design using output-sensitive techniques,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93012,"Maria-Florina Balcan, Christopher Seiler, Dravyansh Sharma","Data-driven algorithm design is a promising, learning-based approach for beyond worst-case analysis of algorithms with tunable parameters. An important open problem is the design of computationally efficient data-driven algorithms for combinatorial algorithm families with multiple parameters. As one fixes the problem instance and varies the parameters, the “dual” loss function typically has a piecewise-decomposable structure, i.e. is well-behaved except at certain sharp transition boundaries. Motivated by prior empirical work, we initiate the study of techniques to develop efficient ERM learning algorithms for data-driven algorithm design by enumerating the pieces of the sum dual loss functions for a collection of problem instances. The running time of our approach scales with the actual number of pieces that appear as opposed to worst case upper bounds on the number of pieces. Our approach involves two novel ingredients – an output-sensitive algorithm for enumerating polytopes induced by a set of hyperplanes using tools from computational geometry, and an execution graph which compactly represents all the states the algorithm could attain for all possible parameter values. We illustrate our techniques by giving algorithms for pricing problems, linkage-based clustering and dynamic-programming based sequence alignment."
Poster,Accelerating Greedy Coordinate Gradient and General Prompt Optimization via Probe Sampling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96146,"Yiran Zhao, Wenyue Zheng, Tianle Cai, Do Xuan Long, Kenji Kawaguchi, Anirudh Goyal, Michael Qizhe Shieh","Safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a central issue given their rapid progress and wide applications. Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) is shown to be effective in constructing prompts containing adversarial suffixes to break the presumingly safe LLMs, but the optimization of GCG is time-consuming and limits its practicality. To reduce the time cost of GCG and enable more comprehensive studies of LLM safety, in this work, we study a new algorithm called $\texttt{Probe sampling}$ to accelerate the GCG algorithm. At the core of the algorithm is a mechanism that dynamically determines how similar a smaller draft model's predictions are to the target model's predictions for prompt candidates. When the target model is similar to the draft model, we rely heavily on the draft model to filter out a large number of potential prompt candidates to reduce the computation time. Probe sampling achieves up to $5.6$ times speedup using Llama2-7b-chat and leads to equal or improved attack success rate (ASR) on the AdvBench. Furthermore, probe sampling is also able to accelerate other prompt optimization techniques and adversarial attack methods, leading to acceleration of $1.8\times$ for AutoPrompt, $2.4\times$ for APE and $2.4\times$ for AutoDAN."
Poster,Accelerating Matroid Optimization through Fast Imprecise Oracles,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96902,"Franziska Eberle, Felix Hommelsheim, Alexander Lindermayr, Zhenwei Liu, Nicole Megow, Jens Schlöter","Querying complex models for precise information (e.g. traffic models, database systems, large ML models) often entails intense computations and results in long response times. Thus, weaker models which give imprecise results quickly can be advantageous, provided inaccuracies can be resolved using few queries to a stronger model. In the fundamental problem of computing a maximum-weight basis of a matroid, a well-known generalization of many combinatorial optimization problems, algorithms have access to a clean oracle to query matroid information. We additionally equip algorithms with a fast but dirty oracle. We design and analyze practical algorithms which only use few clean queries w.r.t. the quality of the dirty oracle, while maintaining robustness against arbitrarily poor dirty oracles, approaching the performance of classic algorithms for the given problem. Notably, we prove that our algorithms are, in many respects, best-possible. Further, we outline extensions to other matroid oracle types, non-free dirty oracles and other matroid problems."
Poster,Accelerating Nash Equilibrium Convergence in Monte Carlo Settings Through Counterfactual Value Based Fictitious Play,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94289,"Qi Ju, Falin Hei, Ting Feng, Dengbing Yi, Zhemei Fang, YunFeng Luo","Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) and its variants are widely recognized as effective algorithms for solving extensive-form imperfect information games. Recently, many improvements have been focused on enhancing the convergence speed of the CFR algorithm. However, most of these variants are not applicable under Monte Carlo (MC) conditions, making them unsuitable for training in large-scale games. We introduce a new MC-based algorithm for solving extensive-form imperfect information games, called MCCFVFP (Monte Carlo Counterfactual Value-Based Fictitious Play). MCCFVFP combines CFR’s counterfactual value calculations with fictitious play’s best response strategy, leveraging the strengths of fictitious play to gain significant advantages in games with a high proportion of dominated strategies. Experimental results show that MCCFVFP achieved convergence speeds approximately 20\%$\sim$50\% faster than the most advanced MCCFR variants in games like poker and other test games."
