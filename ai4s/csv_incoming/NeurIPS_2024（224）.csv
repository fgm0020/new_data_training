Poster,Learning from Pattern Completion: Self-supervised Controllable Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96398,"Zhiqiang Chen, Guofan Fan, Jinying Gao, Lei Ma, Bo Lei, Tiejun Huang, Shan Yu","The human brain exhibits a strong ability to spontaneously associate different visual attributes of the same or similar visual scene, such as associating sketches and graffiti with real-world visual objects, usually without supervising information. In contrast, in the field of artificial intelligence, controllable generation methods like ControlNet heavily rely on annotated training datasets such as depth maps, semantic segmentation maps, and poses, which limits the method’s scalability. Inspired by the neural mechanisms that may contribute to the brain’s associative power, specifically the cortical modularization and hippocampal pattern completion, here we propose a self-supervised controllable generation (SCG) framework. Firstly, we introduce an equivariance constraint to promote inter-module independence and intra-module correlation in a modular autoencoder network, thereby achieving functional specialization. Subsequently, based on these specialized modules, we employ a self-supervised pattern completion approach for controllable generation training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed modular autoencoder effectively achieves functional specialization, including the modular processing of color, brightness, and edge detection, and exhibits brain-like features including orientation selectivity, color antagonism, and center-surround receptive fields. Through self-supervised training, associative generation capabilities spontaneously emerge in SCG, demonstrating excellent zero-shot generalization ability to various tasks such as superresolution, dehaze and associative or conditional generation on painting, sketches, and ancient graffiti. Compared to the previous representative method ControlNet, our proposed approach not only demonstrates superior robustness in more challenging high-noise scenarios but also possesses more promising scalability potential due to its self-supervised manner. Codes are released on Github and Gitee."
Poster,Learning from Snapshots of Discrete and Continuous Data Streams,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95862,"Pramith Devulapalli, Steve Hanneke","Imagine a smart camera trap selectively clicking pictures to understand animal movement patterns within a particular habitat. These ""snapshots"", or pieces of data captured from a data stream at adaptively chosen times, provide a glimpse of different animal movements unfolding through time. Learning a continuous-time process through snapshots, such as smart camera traps, is a central theme governing a wide array of online learning situations. In this paper, we adopt a learning-theoretic perspective in understanding the fundamental nature of learning different classes of functions from both discrete data streams and continuous data streams. In our first framework, the *update-and-deploy* setting, a learning algorithm discretely queries from a process to update a predictor designed to make predictions given as input the data stream. We construct a uniform sampling algorithm that can learn with bounded error any concept class with finite Littlestone dimension. Our second framework, known as the *blind-prediction* setting, consists of a learning algorithm generating predictions independently of observing the process, only engaging with the process when it chooses to make queries. Interestingly, we show a stark contrast in learnability where non-trivial concept classes are unlearnable. However, we show that adaptive learning algorithms are necessary to learn sets of time-dependent and data-dependent functions, called pattern classes, in either framework. Finally, we develop a theory of pattern classes under discrete data streams for the blind-prediction setting."
Poster,Learning from Teaching Regularization: Generalizable Correlations Should be Easy to Imitate,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96222,"Can Jin, Tong Che, Hongwu Peng, Yiyuan Li, Dimitris Metaxas, Marco Pavone","Generalization remains a central challenge in machine learning. In this work, we propose *Learning from Teaching* (**LoT**), a novel regularization technique for deep neural networks to enhance generalization. Inspired by the human ability to capture concise and abstract patterns, we hypothesize that generalizable correlations are expected to be easier to imitate. LoT operationalizes this concept to improve the generalization of the main model with auxiliary student learners. The student learners are trained by the main model and, in turn, provide feedback to help the main model capture more generalizable and imitable correlations. Our experimental results across several domains, including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and methodologies like Reinforcement Learning, demonstrate that the introduction of LoT brings significant benefits compared to training models on the original dataset. The results suggest the effectiveness and efficiency of LoT in identifying generalizable information at the right scales while discarding spurious data correlations, thus making LoT a valuable addition to current machine learning. Code is available at https://github.com/jincan333/LoT."
Poster,Learning from Uncertain Data: From Possible Worlds to Possible Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93223,"Jiongli Zhu, Su Feng, Boris Glavic, Babak Salimi","We introduce an efficient method for learning linear models from uncertain data, where uncertainty is represented as a set of possible variations in the data, leading to predictive multiplicity. Our approach leverages abstract interpretation and zonotopes, a type of convex polytope, to compactly represent these dataset variations, enabling the symbolic execution of gradient descent on all possible worlds simultaneously. We develop techniques to ensure that this process converges to a fixed point and derive closed-form solutions for this fixed point. Our method provides sound over-approximations of all possible optimal models and viable prediction ranges. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through theoretical and empirical analysis, highlighting its potential to reason about model and prediction uncertainty due to data quality issues in training data."
Poster,Learning Generalized Linear Programming Value Functions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94865,"Tu Anh-Nguyen, Joey Huchette, Christian Tjandraatmadja","We develop a theoretically-grounded learning method for the Generalized Linear Programming Value Function (GVF), which models the optimal value of a linear programming (LP) problem as its objective and constraint bounds vary. This function plays a fundamental role in algorithmic techniques for large-scale optimization, particularly in decomposition for two-stage mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs). This paper establishes a structural characterization of the GVF that enables it to be modeled as a particular neural network architecture, which we then use to learn the GVF in a way that benefits from three notable properties. First, our method produces a true under-approximation of the value function with respect to the constraint bounds. Second, the model is input-convex in the constraint bounds, which not only matches the structure of the GVF but also enables the trained model to be efficiently optimized over using LP. Finally, our learning method is unsupervised, meaning that training data generation does not require computing LP optimal values, which can be prohibitively expensive at large scales.  We numerically show that our method can approximate the GVF well, even when compared to supervised methods that collect training data by solving an LP for each data point. Furthermore, as an application of our framework, we develop a fast heuristic method for large-scale two-stage MILPs with continuous second-stage variables, via a compact reformulation that can be solved faster than the full model linear relaxation at large scales and orders of magnitude faster than the original model."
Poster,Learning General Parameterized Policies for Infinite Horizon Average Reward Constrained MDPs via Primal-Dual Policy Gradient Algorithm,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96718,"Qinbo Bai, Washim Mondal, Vaneet Aggarwal","This paper explores the realm of infinite horizon average reward Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs). To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to delve into the regret and constraint violation analysis of average reward CMDPs with a general policy parametrization. To address this challenge, we propose a primal dual-based policy gradient algorithm that adeptly manages the constraints while ensuring a low regret guarantee toward achieving a global optimal policy. In particular, our proposed algorithm achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}({T}^{4/5})$ objective regret and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}({T}^{4/5})$ constraint violation bounds."
Poster,Learning Goal-Conditioned Representations for Language Reward Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95067,"Vaskar Nath, Dylan Slack, Jeff Da, Yuntao Ma, Hugh Zhang, Spencer Whitehead, Sean Hendryx","Techniques that learn improved representations via offline data or self-supervised objectives have shown impressive results in traditional reinforcement learning.Nevertheless, it is unclear how improved representation learning can benefit reinforcement learning from human feedback on language models.In this work, we propose training reward models (RMs) in a contrastive, $\textit{goal-conditioned}$ fashion by increasing the representation similarity of future states along sampled preferred trajectories and decreasing the similarity along randomly sampled dispreferred trajectories.This objective significantly improves reward model performance by up to 0.09 AUROC across challenging benchmarks, such as MATH and GSM8k. These findings extend to general alignment as well -- on the Helpful-Harmless dataset, we observe 2.3\% increase in accuracy.Beyond improving reward model performance, we show this way of training RM representations enables improved steerability because it allows us to evaluate the likelihood of an action achieving a particular goal-state (e.g. whether a solution is correct or helpful).Leveraging this insight, we find that we can filter up to 55\% of generated tokens during majority voting by discarding trajectories likely to end up in an ""incorrect"" state, which leads to significant cost savings.We additionally find that these representations can perform fine-grained control by conditioning on desired future goal-states.For example, we show that steering a Llama 3 model towards helpful generations with our approach improves helpfulness by $9.6$\% over a supervised-fine-tuning trained baseline.Similarly, steering the model towards complex generations improves complexity by $21.6$\% over the baseline.Overall, we find that training RMs in this contrastive, goal-conditioned fashion significantly improves performance and enables model steerability."
Poster,Learning Group Actions on Latent Representations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95844,"Yinzhu Jin, Aman Shrivastava, Tom Fletcher","In this work, we introduce a new approach to model group actions in autoencoders. Diverging from prior research in this domain, we propose to learn the group actions on the latent space rather than strictly on the data space. This adaptation enhances the versatility of our model, enabling it to learn a broader range of scenarios prevalent in the real world, where groups can act on latent factors. Our method allows a wide flexibility in the encoder and decoder architectures and does not require group-specific layers. In addition, we show that our model theoretically serves as a superset of methods that learn group actions on the data space. We test our approach on five image datasets with diverse groups acting on them and demonstrate superior performance to recently proposed methods for modeling group actions."
Poster,Learning Human-like Representations to Enable Learning Human Values,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93391,"Andrea Wynn, Ilia Sucholutsky, Tom Griffiths","How can we build AI systems that can learn any set of individual human values both quickly and safely, avoiding causing harm or violating societal standards for acceptable behavior during the learning process? We explore the effects of representational alignment between humans and AI agents on learning human values. Making AI systems learn human-like representations of the world has many known benefits, including improving generalization, robustness to domain shifts, and few-shot learning performance. We demonstrate that this kind of representational alignment can also support safely learning and exploring human values in the context of personalization. We begin with a theoretical prediction, show that it applies to learning human morality judgments, then show that our results generalize to ten different aspects of human values -- including ethics, honesty, and fairness -- training AI agents on each set of values in a multi-armed bandit setting, where rewards reflect human value judgments over the chosen action. Using a set of textual action descriptions, we collect value judgments from humans, as well as similarity judgments from both humans and multiple language models, and demonstrate that representational alignment enables both safe exploration and improved generalization when learning human values."
Poster,Learning Identifiable Factorized Causal Representations of Cellular Responses,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96237,"Haiyi Mao, Romain Lopez, Kai Liu, Jan-Christian Huetter, David Richmond, Panayiotis Benos, Lin Qiu","The study of cells and their responses to genetic or chemical perturbations promises to accelerate the discovery of therapeutics targets. However, designing adequate and insightful models for such data is difficult because the response of a cell to perturbations essentially depends on contextual covariates (e.g., genetic background or type of the cell). There is therefore a need for models that can identify interactions between drugs and contextual covariates. This is crucial for discovering therapeutics targets, as such interactions may reveal drugs that affect certain cell types but not others.We tackle this problem with a novel Factorized Causal Representation (FCR) learning method, an identifiable deep generative model that reveals causal structure in single-cell perturbation data from several cell lines. FCR learns multiple cellular representations that are disentangled, comprised of covariate-specific (Z_x), treatment-specific (Z_t) and interaction-specific (Z_tx) representations. Based on recent advances of non-linear ICA theory, we prove the component-wise identifiability of Z_tx and block-wise identifiability of Z_t and Z_x. Then, we present our implementation of FCR, and empirically demonstrate that FCR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various tasks across four single-cell datasets."
