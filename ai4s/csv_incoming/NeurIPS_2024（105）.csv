Poster,DiffuLT: Diffusion for Long-tail Recognition Without External Knowledge,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95651,"Jie Shao, Ke Zhu, Hanxiao Zhang, Jianxin Wu","This paper introduces a novel pipeline for long-tail (LT) recognition that diverges from conventional strategies. Instead, it leverages the long-tailed dataset itself to generate a balanced proxy dataset without utilizing external data or model. We deploy a diffusion model trained from scratch on only the long-tailed dataset to create this proxy and verify the effectiveness of the data produced. Our analysis identifies approximately-in-distribution (AID) samples, which slightly deviate from the real data distribution and incorporate a blend of class information, as the crucial samples for enhancing the generative model's performance in long-tail classification. We promote the generation of AID samples during the training of a generative model by utilizing a feature extractor to guide the process and filter out detrimental samples during generation. Our approach, termed Diffusion model for Long-Tail recognition (DiffuLT), represents a pioneer application of generative models in long-tail recognition. DiffuLT achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT, surpassing leading competitors by significant margins. Comprehensive ablations enhance the interpretability of our pipeline. Notably, the entire generative process is conducted without relying on external data or pre-trained model weights, which leads to its generalizability to real-world long-tailed scenarios."
Poster,DiffuPac: Contextual Mimicry in Adversarial Packets Generation via Diffusion Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95657,"Abdullah Bin Jasni, Akiko Manada, Kohei Watabe","In domains of cybersecurity, recent advancements in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have significantly enhanced Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), improving the effectiveness of cybersecurity operations. However, attackers have also leveraged ML/DL to develop sophisticated models that generate adversarial packets capable of evading NIDS detection. Consequently, defenders must study and analyze these models to prepare for the evasion attacks that exploit NIDS detection mechanisms. Unfortunately, conventional generation models often rely on unrealistic assumptions about attackers' knowledge of NIDS components, making them impractical for real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we present DiffuPac, a first-of-its-kind generation model designed to generate adversarial packets that evade detection without relying on specific NIDS components. DiffuPac integrates a pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) with diffusion model, which, through its capability for conditional denoising and classifier-free guidance, effectively addresses the real-world constraint of limited attacker knowledge. By concatenating malicious packets with contextually relevant normal packets and applying targeted noising only to the malicious packets, DiffuPac seamlessly blends adversarial packets into genuine network traffic. Through evaluations on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that DiffuPac achieves strong evasion capabilities against sophisticated NIDS, outperforming conventional methods by an average of 6.69 percentage points, while preserving the functionality and practicality of the generated adversarial packets."
Poster,DiffuserLite: Towards Real-time Diffusion Planning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96816,"Zibin Dong, Jianye Hao, Yifu Yuan, Fei Ni, Yitian Wang, Pengyi Li, YAN ZHENG","Diffusion planning has been recognized as an effective decision-making paradigm in various domains. The capability of generating high-quality long-horizon trajectories makes it a promising research direction. However, existing diffusion planning methods suffer from low decision-making frequencies due to the expensive iterative sampling cost. To alleviate this, we introduce DiffuserLite, a super fast and lightweight diffusion planning framework, which employs a planning refinement process (PRP) to generate coarse-to-fine-grained trajectories, significantly reducing the modeling of redundant information and leading to notable increases in decision-making frequency. Our experimental results demonstrate that DiffuserLite achieves a decision-making frequency of $122.2$Hz ($112.7$x faster than predominant frameworks) and reaches state-of-the-art performance on D4RL, Robomimic, and FinRL benchmarks. In addition, DiffuserLite can also serve as a flexible plugin to increase the decision-making frequency of other diffusion planning algorithms, providing a structural design reference for future works.

Poster,Diffusing Differentiable Representations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95110,"Yash Savani, Marc Finzi, J. Zico Kolter","We introduce a novel, training-free method for sampling *differentiable representations* (diffreps) using pretrained diffusion models. Rather than merely mode-seeking, our method achieves sampling by ""pulling back"" the dynamics of the reverse-time process—from the image space to the diffrep parameter space—and updating the parameters according to this pulled-back process. We identify an implicit constraint on the samples induced by the diffrep and demonstrate that addressing this constraint significantly improves the consistency and detail of the generated objects. Our method yields diffreps with substantially **improved quality and diversity** for images, panoramas, and 3D NeRFs compared to existing techniques. Our approach is a general-purpose method for sampling diffreps, expanding the scope of problems that diffusion models can tackle."
Poster,Diffusion4D: Fast Spatial-temporal Consistent 4D generation via Video Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94114,"HANWEN LIANG, Yuyang Yin, Dejia Xu, hanxue liang, Zhangyang &quot;Atlas&quot; Wang, Konstantinos N Plataniotis, Yao Zhao, Yunchao Wei","The availability of large-scale multimodal datasets and advancements in diffusion models have significantly accelerated progress in 4D content generation. Most prior approaches rely on multiple images or video diffusion models, utilizing score distillation sampling for optimization or generating pseudo novel views for direct supervision. However, these methods are hindered by slow optimization speeds and multi-view inconsistency issues. Spatial and temporal consistency in 4D geometry has been extensively explored respectively in 3D-aware diffusion models and traditional monocular video diffusion models. Building on this foundation, we propose a strategy to migrate the temporal consistency in video diffusion models to the spatial-temporal consistency required for 4D generation. Specifically, we present a novel framework, \textbf{Diffusion4D}, for efficient and scalable 4D content generation. Leveraging a meticulously curated dynamic 3D dataset, we develop a 4D-aware video diffusion model capable of synthesizing orbital views of dynamic 3D assets. To control the dynamic strength of these assets, we introduce a 3D-to-4D motion magnitude metric as guidance. Additionally, we propose a novel motion magnitude reconstruction loss and 3D-aware classifier-free guidance to refine the learning and generation of motion dynamics. After obtaining orbital views of the 4D asset, we perform explicit 4D construction with Gaussian splatting in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms of generation efficiency and 4D geometry consistency across various prompt modalities."
Poster,Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy Regulator,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93857,"Yinuo Wang, Likun Wang, Yuxuan Jiang, Wenjun Zou, Tong Liu, Xujie Song, Wenxuan Wang, Liming Xiao, Jiang Wu, Jingliang Duan, Shengbo Li","Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in addressing complex decision-making and control tasks. However, in most traditional RL algorithms, the policy is typically parameterized as a diagonal Gaussian distribution with learned mean and variance, which constrains their capability to acquire complex policies. In response to this problem, we propose an online RL algorithm termed diffusion actor-critic with entropy regulator (DACER). This algorithm conceptualizes the reverse process of the diffusion model as a novel policy function and leverages the capability of the diffusion model to fit multimodal distributions, thereby enhancing the representational capacity of the policy. Since the distribution of the diffusion policy lacks an analytical expression, its entropy cannot be determined analytically. To mitigate this, we propose a method to estimate the entropy of the diffusion policy utilizing Gaussian mixture model. Building on the estimated entropy, we can learn a parameter $\alpha$ that modulates the degree of exploration and exploitation. Parameter $\alpha$ will be employed to adaptively regulate the variance of the added noise, which is applied to the action output by the diffusion model. Experimental trials on MuJoCo benchmarks and a multimodal task demonstrate that the DACER algorithm achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in most MuJoCo control tasks while exhibiting a stronger representational capacity of the diffusion policy."
Poster,Diffusion-based Curriculum Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93021,"Erdi Sayar, Giovanni Iacca, Ozgur S. Oguz, Alois Knoll","Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is an approach to facilitate the learning process of agents by structuring tasks in a sequence of increasing complexity. Despite its potential, many existing CRL methods struggle to efficiently guide agents toward desired outcomes, particularly in the absence of domain knowledge. This paper introduces DiCuRL (Diffusion Curriculum Reinforcement Learning), a novel method that leverages conditional diffusion models to generate curriculum goals. To estimate how close an agent is to achieving its goal, our method uniquely incorporates a $Q$-function and a trainable reward function based on Adversarial Intrinsic Motivation within the diffusion model. Furthermore, it promotes exploration through the inherent noising and denoising mechanism present in the diffusion models and is environment-agnostic. This combination allows for the generation of challenging yet achievable goals, enabling agents to learn effectively without relying on domain knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiCuRL in three different maze environments and two robotic manipulation tasks simulated in MuJoCo, where it outperforms or matches nine state-of-the-art CRL algorithms from the literature."
Poster,Diffusion-based  Layer-wise Semantic Reconstruction for Unsupervised Out-of-Distribution Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96716,"Ying Yang, De Cheng, Chaowei Fang, Yubiao Wang, Changzhe Jiao, Lechao Cheng, Nannan Wang, Xinbo Gao","Unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to identify out-of-domain data by learning only from unlabeled In-Distribution (ID) training samples, which is crucial for developing a safe real-world machine learning system. Current reconstruction-based method provides a good alternative approach, by measuring the reconstruction error between the input and its corresponding generative counterpart in the pixel/feature space. However, such generative methods face the key dilemma, $i.e.$, improving the reconstruction power of the generative model, while keeping compact representation of the ID data. To address this issue, we propose the diffusion-based layer-wise semantic reconstruction approach for unsupervised OOD detection. The innovation of our approach is that we leverage the diffusion model's intrinsic data reconstruction ability to distinguish ID samples from OOD samples in the latent feature space. Moreover, to set up a comprehensive and discriminative feature representation, we devise a multi-layer semantic feature extraction strategy. Through distorting the extracted features with Gaussian noises and applying the diffusion model for feature reconstruction, the separation of ID and OOD samples is implemented according to the reconstruction errors. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmarks built upon various datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of detection accuracy and speed."
Poster,Diffusion-based Reinforcement Learning via Q-weighted Variational Policy Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94963,"Shutong Ding, Ke Hu, Zhenhao Zhang, Kan Ren, Weinan Zhang, Jingyi Yu, Jingya Wang, Ye Shi","Diffusion models have garnered widespread attention in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for their powerful expressiveness and multimodality. It has been verified that utilizing diffusion policies can significantly improve the performance of RL algorithms in continuous control tasks by overcoming the limitations of unimodal policies, such as Gaussian policies. Furthermore, the multimodality of diffusion policies also shows the potential of providing the agent with enhanced exploration capabilities. However, existing works mainly focus on applying diffusion policies in offline RL, while their incorporation into online RL has been less investigated. The diffusion model's training objective, known as the variational lower bound, cannot be applied directly in online RL due to the unavailability of 'good' samples (actions). To harmonize the diffusion model with online RL, we propose a novel model-free diffusion-based online RL algorithm named Q-weighted Variational Policy Optimization (QVPO). Specifically, we introduce the Q-weighted variational loss and its approximate implementation in practice. Notably, this loss is shown to be a tight lower bound of the policy objective. To further enhance the exploration capability of the diffusion policy, we design a special entropy regularization term. Unlike Gaussian policies, the log-likelihood in diffusion policies is inaccessible; thus this entropy term is nontrivial. Moreover, to reduce the large variance of diffusion policies, we also develop an efficient behavior policy through action selection. This can further improve its sample efficiency during online interaction. Consequently, the QVPO algorithm leverages the exploration capabilities and multimodality of diffusion policies, preventing the RL agent from converging to a sub-optimal policy. To verify the effectiveness of QVPO, we conduct comprehensive experiments on MuJoCo continuous control benchmarks. The final results demonstrate that QVPO achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both cumulative reward and sample efficiency."
Poster,DiffusionBlend: Learning 3D Image Prior through Position-aware Diffusion Score Blending for 3D Computed Tomography Reconstruction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94095,"Bowen Song, Jason Hu, Zhaoxu Luo, Jeffrey Fessler, Liyue Shen","Diffusion models face significant challenges when employed for large-scale medical image reconstruction in real practice such as 3D Computed Tomography (CT).Due to the demanding memory, time, and data requirements, it is difficult to train a diffusion model directly on the entire volume of high-dimensional data to obtain an efficient 3D diffusion prior. Existing works utilizing diffusion priors on single 2D image slice with hand-crafted cross-slice regularization would sacrifice the z-axis consistency, which results in severe artifacts along the z-axis. In this work, we propose a novel framework that enables learning the 3D image prior through position-aware 3D-patch diffusion score blending for reconstructing large-scale 3D medical images. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to utilize a 3D-patch diffusion prior for 3D medical image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on sparse view and limited angle CT reconstructionshow that our DiffusionBlend method significantly outperforms previous methodsand achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world CT reconstruction problems with high-dimensional 3D image (i.e., $256 \times 256 \times 500$). Our algorithm also comes with better or comparable computational efficiency than previous state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/efzero/DiffusionBlend."
