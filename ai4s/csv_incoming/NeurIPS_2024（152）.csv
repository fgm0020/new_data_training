Poster,Fetch and Forge: Efficient Dataset Condensation for Object Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93773,"Ding Qi, Jian Li, Jinlong Peng, Bo Zhao, Shuguang Dou, Jialin Li, Jiangning Zhang, Yabiao Wang, Chengjie Wang, Cairong Zhao","Dataset condensation (DC) is an emerging technique capable of creating compact synthetic datasets from large originals while maintaining considerable performance. It is crucial for accelerating network training and reducing data storage requirements. However, current research on DC mainly focuses on image classification, with less exploration of object detection.This is primarily due to two challenges: (i) the multitasking nature of object detection complicates the condensation process, and (ii) Object detection datasets are characterized by large-scale and high-resolution data, which are difficult for existing DC methods to handle.As a remedy, we propose DCOD, the first dataset condensation framework for object detection. It operates in two stages: Fetch and Forge, initially storing key localization and classification information into model parameters, and then reconstructing synthetic images via model inversion. For the complex of multiple objects in an image, we propose Foreground Background Decoupling to centrally update the foreground of multiple instances and Incremental PatchExpand to further enhance the diversity of foregrounds.Extensive experiments on various detection datasets demonstrate the superiority of DCOD. Even at an extremely low compression rate of 1\%, we achieve 46.4\% and 24.7\% $\text{AP}_{50}$ on the VOC and COCO, respectively, significantly reducing detector training duration."
Poster,Few-Shot Adversarial Prompt Learning on Vision-Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93713,"Yiwei Zhou, Xiaobo Xia, Zhiwei Lin, Bo Han, Tongliang Liu","The vulnerability of deep neural networks to imperceptible adversarial perturbations has attracted widespread attention. Inspired by the success of vision-language foundation models, previous efforts achieved zero-shot adversarial robustness by aligning adversarial visual features with text supervision. However, in practice, they are still unsatisfactory due to several issues, including heavy adaptation cost, suboptimal text supervision, and uncontrolled natural generalization capacity. In this paper, to address these issues, we propose a few-shot adversarial prompt framework where adapting input sequences with limited data makes significant adversarial robustness improvement. Specifically, we achieve this by providing adversarially correlated text supervision that is end-to-end learned from adversarial examples. We also propose a novel training objective that enhances the consistency of multi-modal features while encourages differentiated uni-modal features between natural and adversarial examples. The proposed framework gives access to learn adversarial text supervision, which provides superior cross-modal adversarial alignment and matches state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness with only 1\% training data.

Poster,Few-shot Algorithms for Consistent Neural Decoding (FALCON) Benchmark,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97780,"Brianna Karpowicz, Joel Ye, Chaofei Fan, Pablo Tostado-Marcos, Fabio Rizzoglio, Clayton Washington, Thiago Scodeler, Diogo de Lucena, Samuel Nason-Tomaszewski, Matthew Mender, Xuan Ma, Ezequiel Arneodo, Leigh Hochberg, Cynthia Chestek, Jaimie Henderson, Timothy Gentner, Vikash Gilja, Lee Miller, Adam Rouse, Robert Gaunt, Jennifer Collinger, Chethan Pandarinath","Intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) can restore movement and communication abilities to individuals with paralysis by decoding their intended behavior from neural activity recorded with an implanted device. While this activity yields high-performance decoding over short timescales, neural data is often nonstationary, which can lead to decoder failure if not accounted for. To maintain performance, users must frequently recalibrate decoders, which requires the arduous collection of new neural and behavioral data. Aiming to reduce this burden, several approaches have been developed that either limit recalibration data requirements (few-shot approaches) or eliminate explicit recalibration entirely (zero-shot approaches). However, progress is limited by a lack of standardized datasets and comparison metrics, causing methods to be compared in an ad hoc manner.  Here we introduce the FALCON benchmark suite (Few-shot Algorithms for COnsistent Neural decoding) to standardize evaluation of iBCI robustness. FALCON curates five datasets of neural and behavioral data that span movement and communication tasks to focus on behaviors of interest to modern-day iBCIs. Each dataset includes calibration data, optional few-shot recalibration data, and private evaluation data. We implement a flexible evaluation platform which only requires user-submitted code to return behavioral predictions on unseen data. We also seed the benchmark by applying baseline methods spanning several classes of possible approaches. FALCON aims to provide rigorous selection criteria for robust iBCI decoders, easing their translation to real-world devices. https://snel-repo.github.io/falcon/"
Poster,Few-Shot Diffusion Models Escape the Curse of Dimensionality,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95694,"Ruofeng Yang, Bo Jiang, Cheng Chen, ruinan Jin, Baoxiang Wang, Shuai Li","While diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance, there is a growing need for generating samples tailored to specific user-defined concepts. The customized requirements promote the development of few-shot diffusion models, which use limited $n_{ta}$ target samples to fine-tune a pre-trained diffusion model trained on $n_s$ source samples. Despite the empirical success, no theoretical work specifically analyzes few-shot diffusion models. Moreover, the existing results for diffusion models without a fine-tuning phase can not explain why few-shot models generate great samples due to the curse of dimensionality. In this work, we analyze few-shot diffusion models under a linear structure distribution with a latent dimension $d$. From the approximation perspective, we prove that few-shot models have a $\widetilde{O}(n_s^{-2/d}+n_{ta}^{-1/2})$ bound to approximate the target score function, which is better than $n_{ta}^{-2/d}$ results. From the optimization perspective, we consider a latent Gaussian special case and prove that the optimization problem has a closed-form minimizer. This means few-shot models can directly obtain an approximated minimizer without a complex optimization process. Furthermore, we also provide the accuracy bound $\widetilde{O}(1/n_{ta}+1/\sqrt{n_s})$ for the empirical solution, which still has better dependence on $n_{ta}$ compared to $n_s$. The results of the real-world experiments also show that the models obtained by only fine-tuning the encoder and decoder specific to the target distribution can produce novel images with the target feature, which supports our theoretical results."
Poster,Few-Shot Task Learning through Inverse Generative Modeling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94524,"Aviv Netanyahu, Yilun Du, Antonia Bronars, Jyothish Pari, Josh Tenenbaum, Tianmin Shu, Pulkit Agrawal","Learning the intents of an agent, defined by its goals or motion style, is often extremely challenging from just a few examples. We refer to this problem as task concept learning and present our approach, Few-Shot Task Learning through Inverse Generative Modeling (FTL-IGM), which learns new task concepts by leveraging invertible neural generative models. The core idea is to pretrain a generative model on a set of basic concepts and their demonstrations. Then, given a few demonstrations of a new concept (such as a new goal or a new action), our method learns the underlying concepts through backpropagation without updating the model weights, thanks to the invertibility of the generative model. We evaluate our method in five domains -- object rearrangement, goal-oriented navigation, motion caption of human actions, autonomous driving, and real-world table-top manipulation. Our experimental results demonstrate that via the pretrained generative model, we successfully learn novel concepts and generate agent plans or motion corresponding to these concepts in (1) unseen environments and (2) in composition with training concepts."
Poster,FewViewGS: Gaussian Splatting with Few View Matching and Multi-stage Training,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93806,"Ruihong Yin, Vladimir Yugay, Yue Li, Sezer Karaoglu, Theo Gevers","The field of novel view synthesis from images has seen rapid advancements with the introduction of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and more recently with 3D Gaussian Splatting. Gaussian Splatting became widely adopted due to its efficiency and ability to render novel views accurately. While Gaussian Splatting performs well when a sufficient amount of training images are available, its unstructured explicit representation tends to overfit in scenarios with sparse input images, resulting in poor rendering performance. To address this, we present a 3D Gaussian-based novel view synthesis method using sparse input images that can accurately render the scene from the viewpoints not covered by the training images. We propose a multi-stage training scheme with matching-based consistency constraints imposed on the novel views without relying on pre-trained depth estimation or diffusion models. This is achieved by using the matches of the available training images to supervise the generation of the novel views sampled between the training frames with color, geometry, and semantic losses. In addition, we introduce a locality preserving regularization for 3D Gaussians which removes rendering artifacts by preserving the local color structure of the scene. Evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates competitive or superior performance of our method in few-shot novel view synthesis compared to existing state-of-the-art methods."
Poster,FFAM: Feature Factorization Activation Map for Explanation of 3D Detectors,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93413,"Shuai Liu, Boyang Li, Zhiyu Fang, Mingyue Cui, Kai Huang","LiDAR-based 3D object detection has made impressive progress recently, yet most existing models are black-box, lacking interpretability. Previous explanation approaches primarily focus on analyzing image-based models and are not readily applicable to LiDAR-based 3D detectors. In this paper, we propose a feature factorization activation map (FFAM) to generate high-quality visual explanations for 3D detectors. FFAM employs non-negative matrix factorization to generate concept activation maps and subsequently aggregates these maps to obtain a global visual explanation. To achieve object-specific visual explanations, we refine the global visual explanation using the feature gradient of a target object. Additionally, we introduce a voxel upsampling strategy to align the scale between the activation map and input point cloud. We qualitatively and quantitatively analyze FFAM with multiple detectors on several datasets. Experimental results validate the high-quality visual explanations produced by FFAM.

Poster,FIARSE: Model-Heterogeneous Federated Learning via Importance-Aware Submodel Extraction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94490,"Feijie Wu, Xingchen Wang, Yaqing Wang, Tianci Liu, Lu Su, Jing Gao","In federated learning (FL), accommodating clients' varied computational capacities poses a challenge, often limiting the participation of those with constrained resources in global model training.  To address this issue, the concept of model heterogeneity through submodel extraction has emerged, offering a tailored solution that aligns the model's complexity with each client's computational capacity. In this work, we propose Federated Importance-Aware Submodel Extraction (FIARSE), a novel approach that dynamically adjusts submodels based on the importance of model parameters, thereby overcoming the limitations of previous static and dynamic submodel extraction methods.  Compared to existing works, the proposed method offers a theoretical foundation for the submodel extraction and eliminates the need for additional information beyond the model parameters themselves to determine parameter importance, significantly reducing the overhead on clients. Extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets to showcase the superior performance of the proposed FIARSE."
Poster,FIDE: Frequency-Inflated Conditional Diffusion Model for Extreme-Aware Time Series Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96595,"Asadullah Hill Galib, Pang-Ning Tan, Lifeng Luo","Time series generation is a crucial aspect of data analysis, playing a pivotal role in learning the temporal patterns and their underlying dynamics across diverse fields. Conventional time series generation methods often struggle to capture extreme values adequately, diminishing their value in critical applications such as scenario planning and management for healthcare, finance, climate change adaptation, and beyond. In this paper, we introduce a conditional diffusion model called FIDE to address the challenge of preserving the distribution of extreme values in generative modeling for time series. FIDE employs a novel high-frequency inflation strategy in the frequency domain, preventing premature fade-out of the extreme value. It also extends traditional diffusion-based model, enabling the generation of samples conditioned on the block maxima, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to capture extreme events. Additionally, the FIDE framework incorporates the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution within its generative modeling framework, ensuring fidelity to both block maxima and overall data distribution. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic data showcase the efficacy of FIDE over baseline methods, highlighting its potential in advancing Generative AI for time series analysis, specifically in accurately modeling extreme events."
Poster,FIFO-Diffusion: Generating Infinite Videos from Text without Training,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93253,"Jihwan Kim, Junoh Kang, Jinyoung Choi, Bohyung Han","We propose a novel inference technique based on a pretrained diffusion model for text-conditional video generation. Our approach, called FIFO-Diffusion, is conceptually capable of generating infinitely long videos without additional training. This is achieved by iteratively performing diagonal denoising, which simultaneously processes a series of consecutive frames with increasing noise levels in a queue; our method dequeues a fully denoised frame at the head while enqueuing a new random noise frame at the tail. However, diagonal denoising is a double-edged sword as the frames near the tail can take advantage of cleaner frames by forward reference but such a strategy induces the discrepancy between training and inference. Hence, we introduce latent partitioning to reduce the training-inference gap and lookahead denoising to leverage the benefit of forward referencing. Practically, FIFO-Diffusion consumes a constant amount of memory regardless of the target video length given a baseline model, while well-suited for parallel inference on multiple GPUs. We have demonstrated the promising results and effectiveness of the proposed methods on existing text-to-video generation baselines. Generated video examples and source codes are available at our project page."
