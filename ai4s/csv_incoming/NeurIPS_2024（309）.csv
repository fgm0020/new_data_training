Poster,PhyloGen: Language Model-Enhanced Phylogenetic Inference via Graph Structure Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95863,"ChenRui Duan, Zelin Zang, Siyuan Li, Yongjie Xu, Stan Z. Li","Phylogenetic trees elucidate evolutionary relationships among species, but phylogenetic inference remains challenging due to the complexity of combining continuous (branch lengths) and discrete parameters (tree topology).     Traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods face slow convergence and computational burdens. Existing Variational Inference methods, which require pre-generated topologies and typically treat tree structures and branch lengths independently, may overlook critical sequence features, limiting their accuracy and flexibility.    We propose PhyloGen, a novel method leveraging a pre-trained genomic language model to generate and optimize phylogenetic trees without dependence on evolutionary models or aligned sequence constraints. PhyloGen views phylogenetic inference as a conditionally constrained tree structure generation problem, jointly optimizing tree topology and branch lengths through three core modules: (i) Feature Extraction, (ii) PhyloTree Construction, and (iii) PhyloTree Structure Modeling.     Meanwhile, we introduce a Scoring Function to guide the model towards a more stable gradient descent.    We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of PhyloGen on eight real-world benchmark datasets. Visualization results confirm PhyloGen provides deeper insights into phylogenetic relationships."
Poster,PhyRecon: Physically Plausible Neural Scene Reconstruction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95212,"Junfeng Ni, Yixin Chen, Bohan Jing, Nan Jiang, Bin Wang, Bo Dai, Puhao Li, Yixin Zhu, Song-Chun Zhu, Siyuan Huang","We address the issue of physical implausibility in multi-view neural reconstruction. While implicit representations have gained popularity in multi-view 3D reconstruction, previous work struggles to yield physically plausible results, limiting their utility in domains requiring rigorous physical accuracy. This lack of plausibility stems from the absence of physics modeling in existing methods and their inability to recover intricate geometrical structures. In this paper, we introduce PHYRECON, the first approach to leverage both differentiable rendering and differentiable physics simulation to learn implicit surface representations. PHYRECON features a novel differentiable particle-based physical simulator built on neural implicit representations. Central to this design is an efficient transformation between SDF-based implicit representations and explicit surface points via our proposed Surface Points Marching Cubes (SP-MC), enabling differentiable learning with both rendering and physical losses. Additionally, PHYRECON models both rendering and physical uncertainty to identify and compensate for inconsistent and inaccurate monocular geometric priors. The physical uncertainty further facilitates physics-guided pixel sampling to enhance the learning of slender structures. By integrating these techniques, our model supports differentiable joint modeling of appearance, geometry, and physics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PHYRECON significantly improves the reconstruction quality. Our results also exhibit superior physical stability in physical simulators, with at least a 40% improvement across all datasets, paving the way for future physics-based applications."
Poster,Physical Consistency Bridges Heterogeneous Data in Molecular Multi-Task Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95877,"Yuxuan Ren, Dihan Zheng, Chang Liu, Peiran Jin, Yu Shi, Lin Huang, Jiyan He, Shengjie Luo, Tao Qin, Tie-Yan Liu","In recent years, machine learning has demonstrated impressive capability in handling molecular science tasks. To support various molecular properties at scale, machine learning models are trained in the multi-task learning paradigm. Nevertheless, data of different molecular properties are often not aligned: some quantities, e.g. equilibrium structure, demand more cost to compute than others, e.g. energy, so their data are often generated by cheaper computational methods at the cost of lower accuracy, which cannot be directly overcome through multi-task learning. Moreover, it is not straightforward to leverage abundant data of other tasks to benefit a particular task. To handle such data heterogeneity challenges, we exploit the specialty of molecular tasks that there are physical laws connecting them, and design consistency training approaches that allow different tasks to exchange information directly so as to improve one another. Particularly, we demonstrate that the more accurate energy data can improve the accuracy of structure prediction. We also find that consistency training can directly leverage force and off-equilibrium structure data to improve structure prediction, demonstrating a broad capability for integrating heterogeneous data."
Poster,Physically Compatible 3D Object Modeling from a Single Image,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93922,"Minghao Guo, Bohan Wang, Pingchuan Ma, Tianyuan Zhang, Crystal Owens, Chuang Gan, Josh Tenenbaum, Kaiming He, Wojciech Matusik","We present a computational framework that transforms single images into 3D physical objects. The visual geometry of a physical object in an image is determined by three orthogonal attributes: mechanical properties, external forces, and rest-shape geometry. Existing single-view 3D reconstruction methods often overlook this underlying composition, presuming rigidity or neglecting external forces. Consequently, the reconstructed objects fail to withstand real-world physical forces, resulting in instability or undesirable deformation -- diverging from their intended designs as depicted in the image. Our optimization framework addresses this by embedding physical compatibility into the reconstruction process. We explicitly decompose the three physical attributes and link them through static equilibrium, which serves as a hard constraint, ensuring that the optimized physical shapes exhibit desired physical behaviors. Evaluations on a dataset collected from Objaverse demonstrate that our framework consistently enhances the physical realism of 3D models over existing methods. The utility of our framework extends to practical applications in dynamic simulations and 3D printing, where adherence to physical compatibility is paramount."
Poster,Physics-Constrained Comprehensive Optical Neural  Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95217,"Yanbing Liu, JIANWEI QIN, Yan Liu, Xi Yue, Xun Liu, Guoqing Wang, Tianyu Li, Ye, Wei Li","With the advantages of low latency, low power consumption, and high parallelism, optical neural networks (ONN) offer a promising solution for time-sensitive and resource-limited artificial intelligence applications. However, the performance of the ONN model is often diminished by the gap between the ideal simulated system and the actual physical system. To bridge the gap, this work conducts extensive experiments to investigate systematic errors in the optical physical system within the context of image classification tasks. Through our investigation, two quantifiable errors—light source instability and exposure time mismatches—significantly impact the prediction performance of ONN. To address these systematic errors, a physics-constrained ONN learning framework is constructed, including a well designed loss function to mitigate the effect of light fluctuations, a CCD adjustment strategy to alleviate the effects of exposure time mismatches and a ’physics-prior based’ error compensation network to manage other systematic errors, ensuring consistent light intensity across experimental results and simulations. In our experiments, the proposed method achieved a test classification accuracy of 96.5% on the MNIST dataset, a substantial improvement over the 61.6% achieved with the original ONN. For the more challenging QuickDraw16 and Fashion MNIST datasets, experimental accuracy improved from 63.0% to 85.7% and from 56.2% to 77.5%, respectively. Moreover, the comparison results further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed physics-constrained ONN learning framework over state-of-the-art ONN approaches. This lays the groundwork for more robust and precise optical computing applications."
Poster,Physics-informed Neural Networks for Functional Differential Equations: Cylindrical Approximation and Its Convergence Guarantees,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95857,"Taiki Miyagawa, Takeru Yokota","We propose the first learning scheme for functional differential equations (FDEs).FDEs play a fundamental role in physics, mathematics, and optimal control.However, the numerical analysis of FDEs has faced challenges due to its unrealistic computational costs and has been a long standing problem over decades.Thus, numerical approximations of FDEs have been developed, but they often oversimplify the solutions. To tackle these two issues, we propose a hybrid approach combining physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with the *cylindrical approximation*. The cylindrical approximation expands functions and functional derivatives with an orthonormal basis and transforms FDEs into high-dimensional PDEs. To validate the reliability of the cylindrical approximation for FDE applications, we prove the convergence theorems of approximated functional derivatives and solutions.Then, the derived high-dimensional PDEs are numerically solved with PINNs.Through the capabilities of PINNs, our approach can handle a broader class of functional derivatives more efficiently than conventional discretization-based methods, improving the scalability of the cylindrical approximation.As a proof of concept, we conduct experiments on two FDEs and demonstrate that our model can successfully achieve typical $L^1$ relative error orders of PINNs $\sim 10^{-3}$.Overall, our work provides a strong backbone for physicists, mathematicians, and machine learning experts to analyze previously challenging FDEs, thereby democratizing their numerical analysis, which has received limited attention."
Poster,Physics-Informed Regularization for Domain-Agnostic Dynamical System Modeling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94000,"Zijie Huang, Wanjia Zhao, Jingdong Gao, Ziniu Hu, Xiao Luo, Yadi Cao, Yuanzhou Chen, Yizhou Sun, Wei Wang","Learning complex physical dynamics purely from data is challenging due to the intrinsic properties of systems to be satisfied. Incorporating physics-informed priors, such as in Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs), achieves high-precision modeling for energy-conservative systems. However, real-world systems often deviate from strict energy conservation and follow different physical priors. To address this, we present a framework that achieves high-precision modeling for a wide range of dynamical systems from the numerical aspect, by enforcing Time-Reversal Symmetry (TRS) via a novel regularization term. It helps preserve energies for conservative systems while serving as a strong inductive bias for non-conservative, reversible systems. While TRS is a domain-specific physical prior, we present the first theoretical proof that TRS loss can universally improve modeling accuracy by minimizing higher-order Taylor terms in ODE integration, which is numerically beneficial to various systems regardless of their properties, even for irreversible systems. By integrating the TRS loss within neural ordinary differential equation models, the proposed model TREAT demonstrates superior performance on diverse physical systems. It achieves a significant 11.5% MSE improvement in a challenging chaotic triple-pendulum scenario, underscoring TREAT’s broad applicability and effectiveness."
Poster,Physics-Informed Variational State-Space Gaussian Processes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93352,"Oliver Hamelijnck, Arno Solin, Theodoros Damoulas","Differential equations are important mechanistic models that are integral to many scientific and engineering applications. With the abundance of available data there has been a growing interest in data-driven physics-informed models. Gaussian processes (GPs) are particularly suited to this task as they can model complex, non-linear phenomena whilst incorporating prior knowledge and quantifying uncertainty. Current approaches have found some success but are limited as they either achieve poor computational scalings or focus only on the temporal setting. This work addresses these issues by introducing a variational spatio-temporal state-space GP that handles linear and non-linear physical constraints while achieving efficient linear-in-time computation costs. We demonstrate our methods in a range of synthetic and real-world settings and outperform the current state-of-the-art in both predictive and computational performance."
Poster,Physics-Regularized Multi-Modal Image Assimilation for Brain Tumor Localization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94680,"Michal Balcerak, Tamaz Amiranashvili, Andreas Wagner, Jonas Weidner, Petr Karnakov, Johannes C. Paetzold, Ivan Ezhov, Petros Koumoutsakos, Benedikt Wiestler, bjoern menze","Physical models in the form of partial differential equations serve as important priors for many under-constrained problems. One such application is tumor treatment planning, which relies on accurately estimating the spatial distribution of tumor cells within a patient’s anatomy. While medical imaging can detect the bulk of a tumor, it cannot capture the full extent of its spread, as low-concentration tumor cells often remain undetectable, particularly in glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor. Machine learning approaches struggle to estimate the complete tumor cell distribution due to a lack of appropriate training data. Consequently, most existing methods rely on physics-based simulations to generate anatomically and physiologically plausible estimations. However, these approaches face challenges with complex and unknown initial conditions and are constrained by overly rigid physical models. In this work, we introduce a novel method that integrates data-driven and physics-based cost functions, akin to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). However, our approach parametrizes the solution directly on a dynamic discrete mesh, allowing for the effective modeling of complex biomechanical behaviors. Specifically, we propose a unique discretization scheme that quantifies how well the learned spatiotemporal distributions of tumor and brain tissues adhere to their respective growth and elasticity equations. This quantification acts as a regularization term, offering greater flexibility and improved integration of patient data compared to existing models. We demonstrate enhanced coverage of tumor recurrence areas using real-world data from a patient cohort, highlighting the potential of our method to improve model-driven treatment planning for glioblastoma in clinical practice."
Poster,Piecewise deterministic generative models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95773,"Andrea Bertazzi, Dario Shariatian, Umut Simsekli, Eric Moulines, Alain Durmus","We introduce a novel class of generative models based on piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs), a family of non-diffusive stochastic processes consisting of deterministic motion and random jumps at random times. Similarly to diffusions, such Markov processes admit time reversals that turn out to be PDMPs as well. We apply this observation to three PDMPs considered in the literature: the Zig-Zag process, Bouncy Particle Sampler, and Randomised Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. For these three particular instances, we show that the jump rates and kernels of the corresponding time reversals admit explicit expressions depending on some conditional densities of the PDMP under consideration before and after a jump. Based on these results, we propose efficient training procedures to learn these characteristics and consider methods to approximately simulate the reverse process. Finally, we provide bounds in the total variation distance between the data distribution and the resulting distribution of our model in the case where the base distribution is the standard $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution. Promising numerical simulations support further investigations into this class of models."
