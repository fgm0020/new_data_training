Poster,realSEUDO for real-time calcium imaging analysis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94683,"Iuliia Dmitrieva, Sergey Babkin, Adam Charles","Closed-loop neuroscience experimentation, where recorded neural activity is used to modify the experiment on-the-fly, is critical for deducing causal connections and optimizing experimental time. Thus while new optical methods permit on-line recording (via Multi-photon calcium imaging) and stimulation (via holographic stimulation) of large neural populations, a critical barrier in creating closed-loop experiments that can target and modulate single neurons is the real-time inference of neural activity from streaming recordings. In particular, while multi-photon calcium imaging (CI) is crucial in monitoring neural populations, extracting a single neuron's activity from the fluorescence videos often requires batch processing of the video data. Without batch processing, dimmer neurons and events are harder to identify and unrecognized neurons can create false positives when computing the activity of known neurons. We solve these issues by adapting a recently proposed robust time-trace estimator---Sparse Emulation of Unused Dictionary Objects (SEUDO) algorithm---as a basis for a new on-line processing algorithm that simultaneously identifies neurons in the fluorescence video and infers their time traces in a way that is robust to as-yet unidentified neurons. To achieve real-time SEUDO (realSEUDO), we introduce a combination of new algorithmic improvements, a fast C-based implementation, and a new cell finding loop to enable realSEUDO to identify new cells on-the-fly with no ""warm-up"" period. We demonstrate comparable performance to offline algorithms (e.g., CNMF), and improved performance over the current on-line approach (OnACID) at speeds of 120 Hz on average. This speed is faster than the typical 30 Hz framerate, leaving critical computation time for the computation of feedback in a closed-loop setting."
Poster,Real-time Core-Periphery Guided ViT with Smart Data Layout Selection on Mobile Devices,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93845,"Zhihao Shu, Xiaowei Yu, Zihao Wu, Wenqi Jia, Yinchen Shi, Miao Yin, Tianming Liu, Dajiang Zhu, Wei Niu","Mobile devices have become essential enablers for AI applications, particularly in scenarios that require real-time performance. Vision Transformer (ViT) has become a fundamental cornerstone in this regard due to its high accuracy. Recent efforts have been dedicated to developing various transformer architectures that offer im- proved accuracy while reducing the computational requirements. However, existing research primarily focuses on reducing the theoretical computational complexity through methods such as local attention and model pruning, rather than considering realistic performance on mobile hardware. Although these optimizations reduce computational demands, they either introduce additional overheads related to data transformation (e.g., Reshape and Transpose) or irregular computation/data-access patterns. These result in significant overhead on mobile devices due to their limited bandwidth, which even makes the latency worse than vanilla ViT on mobile. In this paper, we present ECP-ViT, a real-time framework that employs the core-periphery principle inspired by the brain functional networks to guide self-attention in ViTs and enable the deployment of ViT models on smartphones. We identify the main bottleneck in transformer structures caused by data transformation and propose a hardware-friendly core-periphery guided self-attention to decrease computation demands. Additionally, we design the system optimizations for intensive data transformation in pruned models. ECP-ViT, with the proposed algorithm-system co-optimizations, achieves a speedup of 4.6× to 26.9× on mobile GPUs across four datasets: STL-10, CIFAR100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet."
Poster,Real-Time Recurrent Learning using Trace Units in Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96663,"Esraa Elelimy, Adam White, Michael Bowling, Martha White","Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are used to learn representations in partially observable environments. For agents that learn online and continually interact with the environment, it is desirable to train RNNs with real-time recurrent learning (RTRL); unfortunately, RTRL is prohibitively expensive for standard RNNs. A promising direction is to use linear recurrent architectures (LRUs), where dense recurrent weights are replaced with a complex-valued diagonal, making RTRL efficient. In this work, we build on these insights to provide a lightweight but effective approach for training RNNs in online RL. We introduce Recurrent Trace Units (RTUs), a small modification on LRUs that we nonetheless find to have significant performance benefits over LRUs when trained with RTRL. We find RTUs significantly outperform GRUs and Transformers across several partially observable environments while using significantly less computation."
Poster,Real-Time Selection Under General Constraints via Predictive Inference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93141,"Yuyang Huo, Lin Lu, Haojie Ren, Changliang Zou","Real-time decision-making gets more attention in the big data era. Here, we consider the problem of sample selection in the online setting, where one encounters a possibly infinite sequence of individuals collected over time with covariate information available. The goal is to select samples of interest that are characterized by their unobserved responses until the user-specified stopping time. We derive a new decision rule that enables us to find more preferable samples that meet practical requirements by simultaneously controlling two types of general constraints: individual and interactive constraints, which include the widely utilized False Selection Rate (FSR), cost limitations, and diversity of selected samples. The key elements of our approach involve quantifying the uncertainty of response predictions via predictive inference and addressing individual and interactive constraints in a sequential manner. Theoretical and numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in controlling both individual and interactive constraints."
Poster,Real-time Stereo-based 3D Object Detection for Streaming Perception,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95750,"Changcai Li, Zonghua Gu, Gang Chen, Libo Huang, Wei Zhang, Huihui Zhou","The ability to promptly respond to environmental changes is crucial for the perception system of autonomous driving. Recently, a new task called streaming perception was proposed. It jointly evaluate the latency and accuracy into a single metric for video online perception. In this work, we introduce StreamDSGN, the first real-time stereo-based 3D object detection framework designed for streaming perception. StreamDSGN is an end-to-end framework that directly predicts the 3D properties of objects in the next moment by leveraging historical information, thereby alleviating the accuracy degradation of streaming perception. Further, StreamDSGN applies three strategies to enhance the perception accuracy: (1) A feature-flow-based fusion method, which generates a pseudo-next feature at the current moment to address the misalignment issue between feature and ground truth. (2) An extra regression loss for explicit supervision of object motion consistency in consecutive frames. (3) A large kernel backbone with a large receptive field for effectively capturing long-range spatial contextual features caused by changes in object positions. Experiments on the KITTI Tracking dataset show that, compared with the strong baseline, StreamDSGN significantly improves the streaming average precision by up to 4.33%.

Poster,Real-world Image Dehazing with Coherence-based Pseudo Labeling and Cooperative Unfolding Network,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95790,"Chengyu Fang, Chunming He, Fengyang Xiao, Yulun Zhang, Longxiang Tang, Yuelin Zhang, Kai Li, Xiu Li","Real-world Image Dehazing (RID) aims to alleviate haze-induced degradation in real-world settings. This task remains challenging due to the complexities in accurately modeling real haze distributions and the scarcity of paired real-world data. To address these challenges, we first introduce a cooperative unfolding network that jointly models atmospheric scattering and image scenes, effectively integrating physical knowledge into deep networks to restore haze-contaminated details. Additionally, we propose the first RID-oriented iterative mean-teacher framework, termed the Coherence-based Label Generator, to generate high-quality pseudo labels for network training. Specifically, we provide an optimal label pool to store the best pseudo-labels during network training, leveraging both global and local coherence to select high-quality candidates and assign weights to prioritize haze-free regions. We verify the effectiveness of our method, with experiments demonstrating that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on RID tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/cnyvfang/CORUN-Colabator."
Poster,Reasoning Multi-Agent Behavioral Topology for Interactive Autonomous Driving,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95974,"Haochen Liu, Li Chen, Yu Qiao, Chen Lv, Hongyang Li","Autonomous driving system aims for safe and social-consistent driving through the behavioral integration among interactive agents. However, challenges remain due to multi-agent scene uncertainty and heterogeneous interaction. Current dense and sparse behavioral representations struggle with inefficiency and inconsistency in multi-agent modeling, leading to instability of collective behavioral patterns when integrating prediction and planning (IPP). To address this, we initiate a topological formation that serves as a compliant behavioral foreground to guide downstream trajectory generations. Specifically, we introduce Behavioral Topology (BeTop), a pivotal topological formulation that explicitly represents the consensual behavioral pattern among multi-agent future. BeTop is derived from braid theory to distill compliant interactive topology from multi-agent future trajectories. A synergistic learning framework (BeTopNet) supervised by BeTop facilitates the consistency of behavior prediction and planning within the predicted topology priors. Through imitative contingency learning, BeTop also effectively manages behavioral uncertainty for prediction and planning. Extensive verification on large-scale real-world datasets, including nuPlan and WOMD, demonstrates that BeTop achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prediction and planning tasks. Further validations on the proposed interactive scenario benchmark showcase planning compliance in interactive cases. Code and model is available at https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/BeTop."
Poster,Reasons and Solutions for the Decline in Model Performance after Editing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93066,"Xiusheng Huang, Jiaxiang Liu, Yequan Wang, Kang Liu","Knowledge editing technology has received widespread attention for low-cost updates of incorrect or outdated knowledge in large-scale language models. However, recent research has found that edited models often exhibit varying degrees of performance degradation. The reasons behind this phenomenon and potential solutions have not yet been provided. In order to investigate the reasons for the performance decline of the edited model and optimize the editing method, this work explores the underlying reasons from both data and model perspectives. Specifically, 1) from a data perspective, to clarify the impact of data on the performance of editing models, this paper first constructs a **M**ulti-**Q**uestion **D**ataset (**MQD**) to evaluate the impact of different types of editing data on model performance. The performance of the editing model is mainly affected by the diversity of editing targets and sequence length, as determined through experiments. 2) From a model perspective, this article explores the factors that affect the performance of editing models. The results indicate a strong correlation between the L1-norm of the editing model layer and the editing accuracy, and clarify that this is an important factor leading to the bottleneck of editing performance. Finally, in order to improve the performance of the editing model, this paper further proposes a **D**ump **for** **S**equence (**D4S**) method, which successfully overcomes the previous editing bottleneck by reducing the L1-norm of the editing layer, allowing users to perform multiple effective edits and minimizing model damage. Our code is available at https://github.com/nlpkeg/D4S."
Poster,Re-assembling the past: The RePAIR dataset and benchmark for real world 2D and 3D puzzle solving,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97584,"Theodore Tsesmelis, Luca Palmieri, Marina Khoroshiltseva, Adeela Islam, Gur Elkin, Ofir I Shahar, Gianluca Scarpellini, Stefano Fiorini, Yaniv Ohayon, Nadav Alali, Sinem Aslan, Pietro Morerio, Sebastiano Vascon, Elena gravina, Maria Napolitano, Giuseppe Scarpati, Gabriel zuchtriegel, Alexandra Spühler, Michel Fuchs, Stuart James, Ohad Ben-Shahar, Marcello Pelillo, Alessio Del Bue","This paper proposes the RePAIR dataset that represents a challenging benchmark to test modern computational and data driven methods for puzzle-solving and reassembly tasks. Our dataset has unique properties that are uncommon to current benchmarks for 2D and 3D puzzle solving. The fragments and fractures are realistic, caused by a collapse of a fresco during a World War II bombing at the Pompeii archaeological park. The fragments are also eroded and have missing pieces with irregular shapes and different dimensions, challenging further the reassembly algorithms. The dataset is multi-modal providing  high resolution images with characteristic pictorial elements, detailed 3D scans of the fragments and meta-data annotated by the archaeologists. Ground truth has been generated through several years of unceasing fieldwork, including the excavation and cleaning of each fragment, followed by manual puzzle solving by archaeologists of a subset of approx. 1000 pieces among the 16000 available. After digitizing all the fragments in 3D, a benchmark was prepared to challenge current reassembly and puzzle-solving methods that often solve more simplistic synthetic scenarios. The tested baselines show that there clearly exists a gap to fill in solving this computationally complex problem."
Poster,Reawakening knowledge: Anticipatory recovery from catastrophic interference via structured training,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94697,"Yanlai Yang, Matt Jones, Michael Mozer, Mengye Ren","We explore the training dynamics of neural networks in a structured non-IID setting where documents are presented cyclically in a fixed, repeated sequence. Typically, networks suffer from catastrophic interference when training on a sequence of documents; however, we discover a curious and remarkable property of LLMs finetuned sequentially in this setting: they exhibit *anticipatory* behavior, recovering from the forgetting on documents *before* seeing them again. The behavior emerges and becomes more robust as the architecture scales up its number of parameters. Through comprehensive experiments and visualizations, we uncover new insights into training over-parameterized networks in structured environments."
