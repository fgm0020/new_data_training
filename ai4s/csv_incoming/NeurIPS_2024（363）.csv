Poster,Self-playing Adversarial Language Game Enhances LLM Reasoning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93638,"Pengyu Cheng, Tianhao Hu, Han Xu, Zhisong Zhang, Yong Dai, Lei Han, nan du, Xiaolong Li","We explore the potential of self-play training for large language models (LLMs) in a two-player adversarial language game called Adversarial Taboo. In this game, an attacker and a defender communicate around a target word only visible to the attacker. The attacker aims to induce the defender to speak the target word unconsciously, while the defender tries to infer the target word from the attacker's utterances. To win the game, both players must have sufficient knowledge about the target word and high-level reasoning ability to infer and express in this information-reserved conversation. Hence, we are curious about whether LLMs' reasoning ability can be further enhanced by Self-Playing this Adversarial language Game (SPAG). With this goal, we select several open-source LLMs and let each act as the attacker and play with a copy of itself as the defender on an extensive range of target words. Through reinforcement learning on the game outcomes, we observe that the LLMs' performances uniformly improve on a broad range of reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, iteratively adopting this self-play process can continuously promote LLMs' reasoning abilities. The code is available at https://github.com/Linear95/SPAG."
Poster,Self-Refining Diffusion Samplers: Enabling Parallelization via Parareal Iterations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94781,"Nikil Selvam, Amil Merchant, Stefano Ermon","In diffusion models, samples are generated through an iterative refinement process, requiring hundreds of sequential model evaluations. Several recent methods have introduced approximations (fewer discretization steps or distillation) to trade off speed at the cost of sample quality. In contrast, we introduce Self-Refining Diffusion Samplers (SRDS) that retain sample quality and can improve latency at the cost of additional parallel compute. We take inspiration from the Parareal algorithm, a popular numerical method for parallel-in-time integration of differential equations. In SRDS, a quick but rough estimate of a sample is first created and then iteratively refined in parallel through Parareal iterations. SRDS is not only guaranteed to accurately solve the ODE and converge to the serial solution but also benefits from parallelization across the diffusion trajectory, enabling batched inference and pipelining. As we demonstrate for pre-trained diffusion models, the early convergence of this refinement procedure drastically reduces the number of steps required to produce a sample, speeding up generation for instance by up to 1.7x on a 25-step StableDiffusion-v2 benchmark and up to 4.3x on longer trajectories."
Poster,Self-Retrieval: End-to-End Information Retrieval with One Large Language Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95858,"Qiaoyu Tang, Jiawei Chen, Zhuoqun Li, Bowen Yu, Yaojie Lu, ChengFu, Haiyang Yu, Hongyu Lin, Fei Huang, Ben He, Xianpei Han, Le Sun, Yongbin Li","The rise of large language models (LLMs) has significantly transformed both the construction and application of information retrieval (IR) systems. However, current interactions between IR systems and LLMs remain limited, with LLMs merely serving as part of components within IR systems, and IR systems being constructed independently of LLMs. This separated architecture restricts knowledge sharing and deep collaboration between them.In this paper, we introduce Self-Retrieval, a novel end-to-end LLM-driven information retrieval architecture.Self-Retrieval unifies all essential IR functions within a single LLM, leveraging the inherent capabilities of LLMs throughout the IR process.Specifically, Self-Retrieval internalizes the retrieval corpus through self-supervised learning,  transforms the retrieval process into sequential passage generation, and performs relevance assessment for reranking.Experimental results demonstrate that Self-Retrieval not only outperforms existing retrieval approaches by a significant margin, but also substantially enhances the performance of LLM-driven downstream applications like retrieval-augmented generation."
Poster,Self-Supervised Adversarial Training via Diverse Augmented Queries and Self-Supervised Double Perturbation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96153,"Ruize Zhang, Sheng Tang, Juan Cao","Recently, there have been some works studying self-supervised adversarial training, a learning paradigm that learns robust features without labels. While those works have narrowed the performance gap between self-supervised adversarial training (SAT) and supervised adversarial training (supervised AT), a well-established formulation of SAT and its connections with supervised AT are under-explored. Based on a simple SAT benchmark, we find that SAT still faces the problem of large robust generalization gap and degradation on natural samples. We hypothesize this is due to the lack of data complexity and model regularization and propose a method named as DAQ-SDP (Diverse Augmented Queries Self-supervised Double Perturbation). We first challenge the previous conclusion that complex data augmentations degrade robustness in SAT by using diversely augmented samples as queries to guide adversarial training. Inspired by previous works in supervised AT, we then incorporate a self-supervised double perturbation scheme to self-supervised learning (SSL), which promotes robustness transferable to downstream classification. Our work can be seamlessly combined with models pretrained by different SSL frameworks without revising the learning objectives and helps to bridge the gap between SAT and AT. Our method also improves both robust and natural accuracies across different SSL frameworks. Our code is available at https://github.com/rzzhang222/DAQ-SDP."
Poster,Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information: Learning to Follow Principles without Preference Labels,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94936,"Jan-Philipp Fraenken, Eric Zelikman, Rafael Rafailov, Kanishk Gandhi, Tobias Gerstenberg, Noah Goodman","When prompting a language model (LM), users often expect the model to adhere to a set of behavioral principles across diverse tasks, such as producing insightful content while avoiding harmful or biased language. Instilling such principles (i.e., a constitution) into a model is resource-intensive, technically challenging, and generally requires human preference labels or examples. We introduce SAMI, an iterative algorithm that finetunes a pretrained language model (without requiring preference labels or demonstrations) to increase the conditional mutual information between constitutions and self-generated responses given queries from a dataset. On single-turn dialogue and summarization, a SAMI-trained mistral-7b outperforms the initial pretrained model, with win rates between 66% and 77%. Strikingly, it also surpasses an instruction-finetuned baseline (mistral-7b-instruct) with win rates between 55% and 57% on single-turn dialogue. SAMI requires a model that writes the principles. To avoid dependence on strong models for writing principles, we align a strong pretrained model (mixtral-8x7b) using constitutions written by a weak instruction-finetuned model (mistral-7b-instruct), achieving a 65% win rate on summarization. Finally, we investigate whether SAMI generalizes to diverse summarization principles (e.g., ""summaries should be scientific"") and scales to stronger models (llama3-70b), finding that it achieves win rates of up to 68% for learned and 67% for held-out principles compared to the base model. Our results show that a pretrained LM can learn to follow constitutions without using preference labels, demonstrations, or human oversight."
Poster,Self-supervised Transformation Learning for Equivariant Representations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96393,"Jaemyung Yu, Jaehyun Choi, DongJae Lee, HyeongGwon Hong, Junmo Kim","Unsupervised representation learning has significantly advanced various machine learning tasks. In the computer vision domain, state-of-the-art approaches utilize transformations like random crop and color jitter to achieve invariant representations, embedding semantically the same inputs despite transformations. However, this can degrade performance in tasks requiring precise features, such as localization or flower classification. To address this, recent research incorporates equivariant representation learning, which captures transformation-sensitive information. However, current methods depend on transformation labels and thus struggle with interdependency and complex transformations. We propose Self-supervised Transformation Learning (STL), replacing transformation labels with transformation representations derived from image pairs. The proposed method ensures transformation representation is image-invariant and learns corresponding equivariant transformations, enhancing performance without increased batch complexity. We demonstrate the approach’s effectiveness across diverse classification and detection tasks, outperforming existing methods in 7 out of 11 benchmarks and excelling in detection. By integrating complex transformations like AugMix, unusable by prior equivariant methods, this approach enhances performance across tasks, underscoring its adaptability and resilience. Additionally, its compatibility with various base models highlights its flexibility and broad applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/jaemyung-u/stl."
Poster,Self-Taught Recognizer: Toward Unsupervised Adaptation for Speech Foundation Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93632,"Yuchen Hu, CHEN CHEN, Chao-Han Yang, Chengwei Qin, Pin-Yu Chen, Eng-Siong Chng, Chao Zhang","We propose an unsupervised adaptation framework, Self-TAught Recognizer (STAR), which leverages unlabeled data to enhance the robustness of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems in diverse target domains, such as noise and accents. STAR is developed for prevalent speech foundation models based on Transformer-related architecture with auto-regressive decoding (e.g., Whisper, Canary). Specifically, we propose a novel indicator that empirically integrates step-wise information during decoding to assess the token-level quality of pseudo labels without ground truth, thereby guiding model updates for effective unsupervised adaptation. Experimental results show that STAR achieves an average of 13.5% relative reduction in word error rate across 14 target domains, and it sometimes even approaches the upper-bound performance of supervised adaptation. Surprisingly, we also observe that STAR prevents the adapted model from the common catastrophic forgetting problem without recalling source-domain data. Furthermore, STAR exhibits high data efficiency that only requires less than one-hour unlabeled data, and seamless generality to alternative large speech models and speech translation tasks. Our code aims to open source to the research communities."
Poster,SELMA: Learning and Merging Skill-Specific Text-to-Image Experts with Auto-Generated Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93356,"Jialu Li, Jaemin Cho, Yi-Lin Sung, Jaehong Yoon, Mohit Bansal","Recent text-to-image (T2I) generation models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in creating images from text descriptions. However, these T2I generation models often fail to generate images that precisely match the details of the text inputs, such as incorrect spatial relationship or missing objects. In this paper, we introduce SELMA: Skill-Specific Expert Learning and Merging with Auto-Generated Data, a novel paradigm to improve the faithfulness of T2I models by fine-tuning models on automatically generated, multi-skill image-text datasets, with skill-specific expert learning and merging. First, SELMA leverages an LLM’s in-context learning capability to generate multiple datasets of text prompts that can teach different skills, and then generates the images with a T2I model based on the prompts. Next, SELMA adapts the T2I model to the new skills by learning multiple single-skill LoRA (low-rank adaptation) experts followed by expert merging. Our independent expert fine-tuning specializes multiple models for different skills, and expert merging helps build a joint multi-skill T2I model that can generate faithful images given diverse text prompts, while mitigating the knowledge conflict from different datasets. We empirically demonstrate that SELMA significantly improves the semantic alignment and text faithfulness of state-of-the-art T2I diffusion models on multiple benchmarks (+2.1% on TIFA and +6.9% on DSG), human preference metrics (PickScore, ImageReward, and HPS), as well as human evaluation. Moreover, fine-tuning with image-text pairs auto-collected via SELMA shows comparable performance to fine-tuning with ground truth data. Lastly, we show that fine-tuning with images from a weaker T2I model can help improve the generation quality of a stronger T2I model, suggesting promising weak-to-strong generalization in T2I models. We provide code in the supplementary materials."
Poster,Semantic Density: Uncertainty Quantification for Large Language Models through Confidence Measurement in Semantic Space,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95598,"Xin Qiu, Risto Miikkulainen","With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to various domains, concerns regarding the trustworthiness of LLMs in safety-critical scenarios have been raised, due to their unpredictable tendency to hallucinate and generate misinformation. Existing LLMs do not have an inherent functionality to provide the users with an uncertainty/confidence metric for each response it generates, making it difficult to evaluate trustworthiness. Although several studies aim to develop uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs, they have fundamental limitations, such as being restricted to classification tasks, requiring additional training and data, considering only lexical instead of semantic information, and being prompt-wise but not response-wise. A new framework is proposed in this paper to address these issues. Semantic density extracts uncertainty/confidence information for each response from a probability distribution perspective in semantic space. It has no restriction on task types and is ""off-the-shelf"" for new models and tasks. Experiments on seven state-of-the-art LLMs, including the latest Llama 3 and Mixtral-8x22B models, on four free-form question-answering benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of semantic density compared to prior approaches."
Poster,Semantic Feature Learning for Universal Unsupervised Cross-Domain Retrieval,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92948,"Lixu Wang, Xinyu Du, Qi Zhu","Cross-domain retrieval (CDR) is finding increasingly broad applications across various domains. However, existing efforts have several major limitations, with the most critical being their reliance on accurate supervision. Recent studies thus focus on achieving unsupervised CDR, but they typically assume that the category spaces across domains are identical, an assumption that is often unrealistic in real-world scenarios. This is because only through dedicated and comprehensive analysis can the category composition of a data domain be obtained, which contradicts the premise of unsupervised scenarios. Therefore, in this work, we introduce the problem of **U**niversal **U**nsupervised **C**ross-**D**omain **R**etrieval (U^2CDR) for the first time and design a two-stage semantic feature learning framework to address it. In the first stage, a cross-domain unified prototypical structure is established under the guidance of an instance-prototype-mixed contrastive loss and a semantic-enhanced loss, to counteract category space differences. In the second stage, through a modified adversarial training mechanism, we ensure minimal changes for the established prototypical structure during domain alignment, enabling more accurate nearest-neighbor searching. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and scenarios, including close-set, partial, and open-set CDR, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art CDR methods and other related methods in solving U^2CDR challenges."
