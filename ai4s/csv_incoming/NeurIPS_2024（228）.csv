Poster,Learning the Latent Causal Structure for Modeling Label Noise,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93700,"Yexiong Lin, Yu Yao, Tongliang Liu","In label-noise learning, the noise transition matrix reveals how an instance transitions from its clean label to its noisy label. Accurately estimating an instance's noise transition matrix is crucial for estimating its clean label. However, when only a noisy dataset is available, noise transition matrices can be estimated only for some ""special"" instances. To leverage these estimated transition matrices to help estimate the transition matrices of other instances, it is essential to explore relations between the matrices of these ""special"" instances and those of others. Existing studies typically build the relation by explicitly defining the similarity between the estimated noise transition matrices of ""special"" instances and those of other instances. However, these similarity-based assumptions are hard to validate and may not align with real-world data. If these assumptions fail, both noise transition matrices and clean labels cannot be accurately estimated. In this paper, we found that by learning the latent causal structure governing the generating process of noisy data, we can estimate noise transition matrices without the need for similarity-based assumptions. Unlike previous generative label-noise learning methods, we consider causal relations between latent causal variables and model them with a learnable graphical model. Utilizing only noisy data, our method can effectively learn the latent causal structure. Experimental results on various noisy datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in estimating noise transition matrices, which leads to improved classification accuracy.

Poster,Learning the Optimal Policy for Balancing Short-Term and Long-Term Rewards,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92941,"Qinwei Yang, Xueqing Liu, Yan Zeng, Ruocheng Guo, Yang Liu, Peng Wu","Learning the optimal policy to balance multiple short-term and long-term rewards has extensive applications across various domains. Yet, there is a noticeable scarcity of research addressing policy learning strategies in this context. In this paper, we aim to learn the optimal policy capable of effectively balancing multiple short-term and long-term rewards, especially in scenarios where the long-term outcomes are often missing due to data collection challenges over extended periods. Towards this goal, the conventional linear weighting method, which aggregates multiple rewards into a single surrogate reward through weighted summation, can only achieve sub-optimal policies when multiple rewards are related. Motivated by this, we propose a novel decomposition-based policy learning (DPPL) method that converts the whole problem into subproblems. The DPPL method is capable of obtaining optimal policies even when multiple rewards are interrelated. Nevertheless, the DPPL method requires a set of preference vectors specified in advance, posing challenges in practical applications where selecting suitable preferences is non-trivial. To mitigate this, we further theoretically transform the optimization problem in DPPL into an $\varepsilon$-constraint problem, where $\varepsilon$ represents the minimum acceptable levels of other rewards while maximizing one reward. This transformation provides intuitive into the selection of preference vectors. Extensive experiments are conducted on the proposed method and the results validate the effectiveness of the method."
Poster,Learning to Assist Humans without Inferring Rewards,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94848,"Vivek Myers, Evan Ellis, Sergey Levine, Benjamin Eysenbach, Anca Dragan","Assistive agents should make humans' lives easier. Classically, such assistance is studied through the lens of inverse reinforcement learning, where an assistive agent (e.g., a chatbot, a robot) infers a human's intention and then selects actions to help the human reach that goal. This approach requires inferring intentions, which can be difficult in high-dimensional settings. We build upon prior work that studies assistance through the lens of empowerment: an assistive agent aims to maximize the influence of the human's actions such that they exert a greater control over the environmental outcomes and can solve tasks in fewer steps. We lift the major limitation of prior work in this area—scalability to high-dimensional settings—with contrastive successor representations. We formally prove that these representations estimate a similar notion of empowerment to that studied by prior work and provide a ready-made mechanism for optimizing it. Empirically, our proposed method outperforms prior methods on synthetic benchmarks, and scales to Overcooked, a cooperative game setting. Theoretically, our work connects ideas from information theory, neuroscience, and reinforcement learning, and charts a path for representations to play a critical role in solving assistive problems. Our code is available at https://github.com/vivekmyers/empowerment_successor_representations."
Poster,Learning to Balance Altruism and Self-interest Based on Empathy in Mixed-Motive Games,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93409,"Fanqi Kong, Yizhe Huang, Song-Chun Zhu, Siyuan Qi, Xue Feng","Real-world multi-agent scenarios often involve mixed motives, demanding altruistic agents capable of self-protection against potential exploitation. However, existing approaches often struggle to achieve both objectives. In this paper, based on that empathic responses are modulated by learned social relationships between agents, we propose LASE (**L**earning to balance **A**ltruism and **S**elf-interest based on **E**mpathy), a distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that fosters altruistic cooperation through gifting while avoiding exploitation by other agents in mixed-motive games. LASE allocates a portion of its rewards to co-players as gifts, with this allocation adapting dynamically based on the social relationship --- a metric evaluating the friendliness of co-players estimated by counterfactual reasoning. In particular, social relationship measures each co-player by comparing the estimated $Q$-function of current joint action to a counterfactual baseline which marginalizes the co-player's action, with its action distribution inferred by a perspective-taking module. Comprehensive experiments are performed in spatially and temporally extended mixed-motive games, demonstrating LASE's ability to promote group collaboration without compromising fairness and its capacity to adapt policies to various types of interactive co-players."
Poster,Learning to be Smooth: An End-to-End Differentiable Particle Smoother,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94821,"Ali Younis, Erik Sudderth","For challenging state estimation problems arising in domains like vision and robotics, particle-based representations attractively enable temporal reasoning about multiple posterior modes.  Particle smoothers offer the potential for more accurate offline data analysis by propagating information both forward and backward in time, but have classically required human-engineered dynamics and observation models.  Extending recent advances in discriminative training of particle filters, we develop a framework for low-variance propagation of gradients across long time sequences when training particle smoothers.  Our ""two-filter"" smoother integrates particle streams that are propagated forward and backward in time, while incorporating stratification and importance weights in the resampling step to provide low-variance gradient estimates for neural network dynamics and observation models.  The resulting mixture density particle smoother is substantially more accurate than state-of-the-art particle filters, as well as search-based baselines, for city-scale global vehicle localization from real-world videos and maps."
Poster,Learning-to-Cache: Accelerating Diffusion Transformer via Layer Caching,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94605,"Xinyin Ma, Gongfan Fang, Michael Bi Mi, Xinchao Wang","Diffusion Transformers have recently demonstrated unprecedented generative capabilities for various tasks. The encouraging results, however, come with the cost of slow inference, since each denoising step requires inference on a transformer model with a large scale of parameters. In this study, we make an interesting and somehow surprising observation: the computation of a large proportion of layers in the diffusion transformer, through introducing a caching mechanism, can be readily removed even without updating the model parameters. In the case of U-ViT-H/2, for example, we may remove up to 93.68% of the computation in the cache steps (46.84% for all steps), with less than 0.01 drop in FID. To achieve this, we introduce a novel scheme, named Learning-to-Cache (L2C), that learns to conduct caching in a dynamic manner for diffusion transformers. Specifically, by leveraging the identical structure of layers in transformers and the sequential nature of diffusion, we explore redundant computations between timesteps by treating each layer as the fundamental unit for caching. To address the challenge of the exponential search space in deep models for identifying layers to cache and remove, we propose a novel differentiable optimization objective. An input-invariant yet timestep-variant router is then optimized, which can finally produce a static computation graph. Experimental results show that L2C largely outperforms samplers such as DDIM and DPM-Solver, alongside prior cache-based methods at the same inference speed."
Poster,Learning to compute Gröbner bases,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94636,"Hiroshi Kera, Yuki Ishihara, Yuta Kambe, Tristan Vaccon, Kazuhiro Yokoyama","Solving a polynomial system, or computing an associated Gröbner basis, has been a fundamental task in computational algebra. However, it is also known for its notorious doubly exponential time complexity in the number of variables in the worst case. This paper is the first to address the learning of Gröbner basis computation with Transformers. The training requires many pairs of a polynomial system and the associated Gröbner basis, raising two novel algebraic problems: random generation of Gröbner bases and transforming them into non-Gröbner ones, termed as backward Gröbner problem. We resolve these problems with 0-dimensional radical ideals, the ideals appearing in various applications. Further, we propose a hybrid input embedding to handle coefficient tokens with continuity bias and avoid the growth of the vocabulary set. The experiments show that our dataset generation method is a few orders of magnitude faster than a naive approach, overcoming a crucial challenge in learning to compute Gröbner bases, and Gröbner computation is learnable in a particular class."
Poster,Learning to Cooperate with Humans using Generative Agents,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93229,"Yancheng Liang, Daphne Chen, Abhishek Gupta, Simon Du, Natasha Jaques","Training agents that can coordinate zero-shot with humans is a key mission in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Current algorithms focus on training simulated human partner policies which are then used to train a Cooperator agent. The simulated human is produced either through behavior cloning over a dataset of human cooperation behavior, or by using MARL to create a population of simulated agents. However, these approaches often struggle to produce a Cooperator that can coordinate well with real humans, since the simulated humans fail to cover the diverse strategies and styles employed by people in the real world.  We show \emph{learning a generative model of human partners} can effectively address this issue. Our model learns a latent variable representation of the human that can be regarded as encoding the human's unique strategy, intention, experience, or style. This generative model can be flexibly trained from any (human or neural policy) agent interaction data. By sampling from the latent space, we can use the generative model to produce different partners to train Cooperator agents. We evaluate our method---Generative Agent Modeling for Multi-agent Adaptation (GAMMA)---on Overcooked, a challenging cooperative cooking game that has become a standard benchmark for zero-shot coordination. We conduct an evaluation with real human teammates, and the results show that GAMMA consistently improves performance, whether the generative model is trained on simulated populations or human datasets. Further, we propose a method for posterior sampling from the generative model that is biased towards the human data, enabling us to efficiently improve performance with only a small amount of expensive human interaction data."
Poster,Learning to Decouple the Lights for 3D Face Texture Modeling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96717,"Tianxin Huang, Zhenyu Zhang, Ying Tai, Gim Hee Lee","Existing research has made impressive strides in reconstructing human facial shapes and textures from images with well-illuminated faces and minimal external occlusions. Nevertheless, it remains challenging to recover accurate facial textures from scenarios with complicated illumination affected by external occlusions, \eg a face that is partially obscured by items such as a hat. Existing works based on the assumption of single and uniform illumination cannot correctly process these data.In this work, we introduce a novel approach to model 3D facial textures under such unnatural illumination. Instead of assuming single illumination, our framework learns to imitate the unnatural illumination as a composition of multiple separate light conditions combined with learned neural representations, named Light Decoupling.According to experiments on both single images and video sequences, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in modeling facial textures under challenging illumination affected by occlusions."
Poster,Learning to Discuss Strategically: A Case Study on One Night Ultimate Werewolf,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96856,"Xuanfa Jin, Ziyan Wang, Yali Du, Meng Fang, Haifeng Zhang, Jun Wang","Communication is a fundamental aspect of human society, facilitating the exchange of information and beliefs among people. Despite the advancements in large language models (LLMs), recent agents built with these often neglect the control over discussion tactics, which are essential in communication scenarios and games. As a variant of the famous communication game Werewolf, *One Night Ultimate Werewolf* (ONUW) requires players to develop strategic discussion policies due to the potential role changes that increase the uncertainty and complexity of the game. In this work, we first present the existence of the Perfect Bayesian Equilibria (PBEs) in two scenarios of the ONUW game: one with discussion and one without. The results showcase that the discussion greatly changes players' utilities by affecting their beliefs, emphasizing the significance of discussion tactics. Based on the insights obtained from the analyses, we propose an RL-instructed language agent framework, where a discussion policy trained by reinforcement learning (RL) is employed to determine appropriate discussion tactics to adopt. Our experimental results on several ONUW game settings demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed framework."
