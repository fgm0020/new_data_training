Poster,Enhancing Robustness of Graph Neural Networks on Social Media with Explainable Inverse Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92939,"Yuefei Lyu, Chaozhuo Li, Sihong Xie, Xi Zhang","Adversarial attacks against graph neural networks (GNNs) through perturbations of the graph structure are increasingly common in social network tasks like rumor detection. Social media platforms capture diverse attack sequence samples through both machine and manual screening processes. Investigating effective ways to leverage these adversarial samples to enhance robustness is imperative. We improve the maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) method with the mixture-of-experts approach to address multi-source graph adversarial attacks. This method reconstructs the attack policy, integrating various attack models and providing feature-level explanations, subsequently generating additional adversarial samples to fortify the robustness of detection models. We develop precise sample guidance and a bidirectional update mechanism to reduce the deviation caused by imprecise feature representation and negative sampling within the large action space of social graphs, while also accelerating policy learning. We take rumor detector as an example targeted GNN model on real-world rumor datasets. By utilizing a small subset of samples generated by various graph adversarial attack methods, we reconstruct the attack policy, closely approximating the performance of the original attack method. We validate that samples generated by the learned policy enhance model robustness through adversarial training and data augmentation."
Poster,Enhancing Robustness of Last Layer Two-Stage Fair Model Corrections,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96128,"Nathan Stromberg, Rohan Ayyagari, Sanmi Koyejo, Richard Nock, Lalitha Sankar","Last-layer retraining methods have emerged as an efficient framework for correcting existing base models. Within this framework, several methods have been proposed to deal with correcting models for subgroup fairness with and without group membership information. Importantly, prior work has demonstrated that many methods are susceptible to noisy labels. To this end, we propose a drop-in correction for label noise in last-layer retraining, and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art worst-group accuracy for a broad range of symmetric label noise and across a wide variety of datasets exhibiting spurious correlations. Our proposed approach uses label spreading on a latent nearest neighbors graph and has minimal computational overhead compared to existing methods."
Poster,Enhancing Semi-Supervised Learning via Representative and Diverse Sample Selection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93085,"Qian Shao, Jiangrui Kang, Qiyuan Chen, Zepeng Li, Hongxia Xu, Yiwen Cao, JIAJUAN LIANG, Jian Wu","Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has become a preferred paradigm in many deep learning tasks, which reduces the need for human labor. Previous studies primarily focus on effectively utilising the labelled and unlabeled data to improve performance. However, we observe that how to select samples for labelling also significantly impacts performance, particularly under extremely low-budget settings. The sample selection task in SSL has been under-explored for a long time. To fill in this gap, we propose a Representative and Diverse Sample Selection approach (RDSS). By adopting a modified Frank-Wolfe algorithm to minimise a novel criterion $\alpha$-Maximum Mean Discrepancy ($\alpha$-MMD), RDSS samples a representative and diverse subset for annotation from the unlabeled data. We demonstrate that minimizing $\alpha$-MMD enhances the generalization ability of low-budget learning. Experimental results show that RDSS consistently improves the performance of several popular SSL frameworks and outperforms the state-of-the-art sample selection approaches used in Active Learning (AL) and Semi-Supervised Active Learning (SSAL), even with constrained annotation budgets. Our code is available at [RDSS](https://github.com/YanhuiAILab/RDSS)."
Poster,Enhancing vision-language models for medical imaging: bridging the 3D gap with innovative slice selection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97755,"Yuli Wang, Peng jian, Yuwei Dai, Craig Jones, Haris Sair, Jinglai Shen, Nicolas Loizou, jing wu, Wen-Chi Hsu, Maliha Imami, Zhicheng Jiao, Paul Zhang, Harrison Bai","Recent approaches to vision-language tasks are built on the remarkable capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs). These models excel in zero-shot and few-shot learning, enabling them to learn new tasks without parameter updates. However, their primary challenge lies in their design, which primarily accommodates 2D input, thus limiting their effectiveness for medical images, particularly radiological images like MRI and CT, which are typically 3D. To bridge the gap between state-of-the-art 2D VLMs and 3D medical image data, we developed an innovative, one-pass, unsupervised representative slice selection method called Vote-MI, which selects representative 2D slices from 3D medical imaging. To evaluate the effectiveness of vote-MI when implemented with VLMs, we introduce BrainMD, a robust, multimodal dataset comprising 2,453 annotated 3D MRI brain scans with corresponding textual radiology reports and electronic health records. Based on BrainMD, we further develop two benchmarks, BrainMD-select (including the most representative 2D slice of 3D image) and BrainBench (including various vision-language downstream tasks). Extensive experiments on the BrainMD dataset and its two corresponding benchmarks demonstrate that our representative selection method significantly improves performance in zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks. On average, Vote-MI achieves a 14.6\% and 16.6\% absolute gain for zero-shot and few-shot learning, respectively, compared to randomly selecting examples. Our studies represent a significant step toward integrating AI in medical imaging to enhance patient care and facilitate medical research. We hope this work will serve as a foundation for data selection as vision-language models are increasingly applied to new tasks."
Poster,Enhancing Zero-Shot Vision Models by Label-Free Prompt Distribution Learning and Bias Correcting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95379,"Xingyu Zhu, Beier Zhu, Yi Tan, Shuo Wang, Yanbin Hao, Hanwang Zhang","Vision-language models, such as CLIP, have shown impressive generalization capacities when using appropriate text descriptions. While optimizing prompts on downstream labeled data has proven effective in improving performance, these methods entail labor costs for annotations and are limited by their quality. Additionally, since CLIP is pre-trained on highly imbalanced Web-scale data, it suffers from inherent label bias that leads to suboptimal performance.  To tackle the above challenges, we propose a label-**F**ree p**ro**mpt distribution **l**earning and b**i**as **c**orrection framework, dubbed as **Frolic**, which boosts zero-shot performance without the need for labeled data. Specifically, our Frolic learns distributions over prompt prototypes to capture diverse visual representations and adaptively fuses these with the original CLIP through confidence matching.This fused model is further enhanced by correcting label bias via a label-free logit adjustment. Notably, our method is not only training-free but also circumvents the necessity for hyper-parameter tuning. Extensive experimental results across 16 datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, particularly outperforming the state-of-the-art by an average of $2.6\%$ on 10 datasets with CLIP ViT-B/16 and achieving an average margin of $1.5\%$ on ImageNet and its five distribution shifts with CLIP ViT-B/16.

Poster,EnOF-SNN: Training Accurate Spiking Neural Networks via Enhancing the Output Feature,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95074,"Yufei Guo, Weihang Peng, Xiaode Liu, Yuanpei Chen, Yuhan Zhang, Xin Tong, Zhou Jie, Zhe Ma","Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained more and more interest as one of the energy-efficient alternatives of conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs). They exchange 0/1 spikes for processing information, thus most of the multiplications in networks can be replaced by additions. However, binary spike feature maps will limit the expressiveness of the SNN and result in unsatisfactory performance compared with ANNs. It is shown that a rich output feature representation, i.e., the feature vector before classifier) is beneficial to training an accurate model in ANNs for classification. We wonder if it also does for SNNs and how to improve the feature representation of the SNN.To this end, we materialize this idea in two special designed methods for SNNs.First, inspired by some ANN-SNN methods that directly copy-paste the weight parameters from trained ANN with light modification to homogeneous SNN can obtain a well-performed SNN, we use rich information of the weight parameters from the trained ANN counterpart to guide the feature representation learning of the SNN. In particular, we present the SNN's and ANN's feature representation from the same input to ANN's classifier to product SNN's and ANN's outputs respectively and then align the feature with the KL-divergence loss as in knowledge distillation methods, called L_ AF loss.It can be seen as a novel and effective knowledge distillation method specially designed for the SNN that comes from both the knowledge distillation and ANN-SNN methods. Various ablation study shows that the L_AF loss is more powerful than the vanilla knowledge distillation method.Second, we replace the last Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) activation layer as the ReLU activation layer to generate the output feature, thus a more powerful SNN with full-precision feature representation can be achieved but with only a little extra computation.Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithms on both popular non-spiking static and neuromorphic datasets. We provide an extremely simple but effective way to train high-accuracy spiking neural networks."
Poster,Enriching Disentanglement: From Logical Definitions to Quantitative Metrics,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93305,"Yivan Zhang, Masashi Sugiyama","Disentangling the explanatory factors in complex data is a promising approach for generalizable and data-efficient representation learning. While a variety of quantitative metrics for learning and evaluating disentangled representations have been proposed, it remains unclear what properties these metrics truly quantify. In this work, we establish algebraic relationships between logical definitions and quantitative metrics to derive theoretically grounded disentanglement metrics. Concretely, we introduce a compositional approach for converting a higher-order predicate into a real-valued quantity by replacing (i) equality with a strict premetric, (ii) the Heyting algebra of binary truth values with a quantale of continuous values, and (iii) quantifiers with aggregators. The metrics induced by logical definitions have strong theoretical guarantees, and some of them are easily differentiable and can be used as learning objectives directly. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed metrics by isolating different aspects of disentangled representations."
Poster,Ensemble Learning for Heterogeneous Large Language Models with Deep Parallel Collaboration,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96435,"Yichong Huang, Xiaocheng Feng, Baohang Li, Yang Xiang, Hui Wang, Ting Liu, Bing Qin","Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths in various tasks, motivating the research of LLM ensembling.However, existing work focuses on training an extra reward model or fusion model to select or combine all candidate answers, posing a great challenge to the generalization on unseen data distributions.Besides, prior methods use textual responses as communication media, ignoring the valuable information in the internal representations.In this work, we propose a training-free ensemble framework \textsc{DeePEn}, fusing the informative probability distributions yielded by different LLMs at each decoding step.Unfortunately, the vocabulary discrepancy between heterogeneous LLMs directly makes averaging the distributions unfeasible due to the token misalignment.To address this challenge, \textsc{DeePEn} maps the probability distribution of each model from its own probability space to a universal \textit{relative space} based on the relative representation theory, and performs aggregation.Next, we devise a search-based inverse transformation to transform the aggregated result back to the probability space of one of the ensembling LLMs (main model), in order to determine the next token.We conduct extensive experiments on ensembles of different number of LLMs, ensembles of LLMs with different architectures, and ensembles between the LLM and the specialist model.Experimental results show that (i) \textsc{DeePEn} achieves consistent improvements across six benchmarks covering subject examination, reasoning, and knowledge, (ii) a well-performing specialist model can benefit from a less effective LLM through distribution fusion, and (iii) \textsc{DeePEn} has complementary strengths with other ensemble methods such as voting."
Poster,Ensemble sampling for linear bandits: small ensembles suffice,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95104,"David Janz, Alexander Litvak, Csaba Szepesvari","We provide the first useful and rigorous analysis of ensemble sampling for the stochastic linear bandit setting. In particular, we show that, under standard assumptions, for a $d$-dimensional stochastic linear bandit with an interaction horizon $T$, ensemble sampling with an ensemble of size of order $\smash{d \log T}$ incurs regret at most of the order $\smash{(d \log T)^{5/2} \sqrt{T}}$. Ours is the first result in any structured setting not to require the size of the ensemble to scale linearly with $T$---which defeats the purpose of ensemble sampling---while obtaining  near $\smash{\sqrt{T}}$ order regret. Our result is also the first to allow for infinite action sets."
Poster,EnsIR: An Ensemble Algorithm for Image Restoration via Gaussian Mixture Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93407,"Shangquan Sun, Wenqi Ren, Zikun Liu, Hyunhee Park, Rui Wang, Xiaochun Cao","Image restoration has experienced significant advancements due to the development of deep learning. Nevertheless, it encounters challenges related to ill-posed problems, resulting in deviations between single model predictions and ground-truths. Ensemble learning, as a powerful machine learning technique, aims to address these deviations by combining the predictions of multiple base models. Most existing works adopt ensemble learning during the design of restoration models, while only limited research focuses on the inference-stage ensemble of pre-trained restoration models. Regression-based methods fail to enable efficient inference, leading researchers in academia and industry to prefer averaging as their choice for post-training ensemble. To address this, we reformulate the ensemble problem of image restoration into Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and employ an expectation maximization (EM)-based algorithm to estimate ensemble weights for aggregating prediction candidates. We estimate the range-wise ensemble weights on a reference set and store them in a lookup table (LUT) for efficient ensemble inference on the test set. Our algorithm is model-agnostic and training-free, allowing seamless integration and enhancement of various pre-trained image restoration models. It consistently outperforms regression-based methods and averaging ensemble approaches on 14 benchmarks across 3 image restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring and deraining. The codes and all estimated weights have been released in Github."
