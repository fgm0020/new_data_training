Poster,Code Repair with LLMs gives an Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93642,"Hao Tang, Keya Hu, Jin Zhou, Si Cheng Zhong, Wei-Long Zheng, Xujie Si, Kevin Ellis","Iteratively improving and repairing source code with large language models (LLMs), known as refinement, has emerged as a popular way of generating programs that would be too complex to construct in one shot. Given a bank of test cases, together with a candidate program, an LLM can improve that program by being prompted with failed test cases. But it remains an open question how to best iteratively refine code, with prior work employing simple greedy or breadth-first strategies. We show here that refinement exposes an explore-exploit tradeoff: exploit by refining the program that passes the most test cases, or explore by refining a lesser considered program. We frame this as an arm-acquiring bandit problem, which we solve with Thompson Sampling. The resulting LLM-based program synthesis algorithm is broadly applicable: Across loop invariant synthesis, visual reasoning puzzles, and competition programming problems, we find that our new method can solve more problems using fewer language model calls."
Poster,CodeRosetta: Pushing the Boundaries of Unsupervised Code Translation for Parallel Programming,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94924,"Ali Tehrani, Arijit Bhattacharjee, Le Chen, Nesreen K. Ahmed, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Ali Jannesari","Automatic translation of programming languages has garnered renewed interest, driven by recent advancements in large language models (LLMs). Encoder-decoder transformer models, in particular, have shown promise in translating between different programming languages. However, translating between a language and its high-performance computing (HPC) extension remains underexplored due to inherent challenges like complex parallel semantics understanding. In this paper, we introduce CodeRosetta, an encoder-decoder transformer model explicitly designed for translating between programming languages and also their HPC extensions. CodeRosetta is evaluated on C++ to CUDA and Fortran to C++ translation.It employs a customized learning-based framework with tailored pretraining and training objectives that enable it to effectively capture code semantics and parallel structural nuances, allowing for bidirectional code translation. Our results show that CodeRosetta outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in C++ to CUDA translation by 2.9 BLEU and 1.72 CodeBLUE points while improving compilation accuracy by 6.05%. Compared to general closed-source LLMs, our proposed bidirectional learning-based method improves C++ to CUDA translation by 22.08 BLEU and 14.39 CodeBLUE with 2.75% higher compilation accuracy.Finally, CodeRosetta exhibits proficiency in Fortran to parallel C++ translation, marking it, to our knowledge, as the first encoder-decoder model for such a complex translation task, improving CodeBLEU at least by 4.63 points compared to closed-source LLMs and Open Code LLM."
Poster,Coevolving with the Other You: Fine-Tuning LLM with Sequential Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95347,"Hao Ma, Tianyi Hu, Zhiqiang Pu, Liu Boyin, Xiaolin Ai, Yanyan Liang, Min Chen","Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on specific tasks. However, prevailing RL fine-tuning methods predominantly rely on PPO and its variants. Though these algorithms are effective in general RL settings, they often exhibit suboptimal performance and vulnerability to distribution collapse when applied to the fine-tuning of LLMs. In this paper, we propose CORY, extending the RL fine-tuning of LLMs to a sequential cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, to leverage the inherent coevolution and emergent capabilities of multi-agent systems. In CORY, the LLM to be fine-tuned is initially duplicated into two autonomous agents: a pioneer and an observer. The pioneer generates responses based on queries, while the observer generates responses using both the queries and the pioneer’s responses. The two agents are trained together. During training, the agents exchange roles periodically, fostering cooperation and coevolution between them. Experiments evaluate CORY's performance by fine-tuning GPT-2 and Llama-2 under subjective and objective reward functions on the IMDB Review and GSM8K datasets, respectively. Results show that CORY outperforms PPO in terms of policy optimality, resistance to distribution collapse, and training robustness, thereby underscoring its potential as a superior methodology for refining LLMs in real-world applications."
Poster,CoFie: Learning Compact Neural Surface Representations with Coordinate Fields,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96938,"Hanwen Jiang, Haitao Yang, Georgios Pavlakos, Qixing Huang","This paper introduces CoFie, a novel local geometry-aware neural surface representation. CoFie is motivated by the theoretical analysis of local SDFs with quadratic approximation. We find that local shapes are highly compressive in an aligned coordinate frame defined by the normal and tangent directions of local shapes. Accordingly, we introduce Coordinate Field, which is a composition of coordinate frames of all local shapes. The Coordinate Field is optimizable and is used to transform the local shapes from the world coordinate frame to the aligned shape coordinate frame. It largely reduces the complexity of local shapes and benefits the learning of MLP-based implicit representations. Moreover, we introduce quadratic layers into the MLP to enhance expressiveness concerning local shape geometry. CoFie is a generalizable surface representation. It is trained on a curated set of 3D shapes and works on novel shape instances during testing. When using the same amount of parameters with prior works, CoFie reduces the shape error by 48% and 56% on novel instances of both training and unseen shape categories. Moreover, CoFie demonstrates comparable performance to prior works when using even 70% fewer parameters. Code and model can be found here: https://hwjiang1510.github.io/CoFie/"
Poster,CogVLM: Visual Expert for Pretrained Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96510,"Weihan Wang, Qingsong Lv, Wenmeng Yu, Wenyi Hong, Ji Qi, Yan Wang, Junhui Ji, Zhuoyi Yang, Lei Zhao, Song XiXuan, Jiazheng Xu, Keqin Chen, Bin Xu, Juanzi Li, Yuxiao Dong, Ming Ding, Jie Tang","We introduce CogVLM, a powerful open-source visual language foundation model. Different from the popular \emph{shallow alignment} method which maps image features into the input space of language model, CogVLM bridges the gap between the frozen pretrained language model and image encoder by a trainable visual expert module in the attention and FFN layers. As a result, CogVLM enables a deep fusion of vision language features without sacrificing any performance on NLP tasks. CogVLM-17B achieves state-of-the-art performance on 17 classic cross-modal benchmarks, including 1) image captioning datasets: NoCaps, Flicker30k, 2) VQA datasets: OKVQA, TextVQA, OCRVQA, ScienceQA, 3) LVLM benchmarks: MM-Vet, MMBench, SEED-Bench, LLaVABench, POPE, MMMU, MathVista, 4) visual grounding datasets: RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, Visual7W. Codes and checkpoints are available at Github."
Poster,Coherence-free Entrywise Estimation of Eigenvectors in Low-rank Signal-plus-noise Matrix Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96125,"Hao Yan, Keith Levin","Spectral methods are widely used to estimate eigenvectors of a low-rank signal matrix subject to noise. These methods use the leading eigenspace of an observed matrix to estimate this low-rank signal. Typically, the entrywise estimation error of these methods depends on the coherence of the low-rank signal matrix with respect to the standard basis. In this work, we present a novel method for eigenvector estimation that avoids this dependence on coherence. Assuming a rank-one signal matrix, under mild technical conditions, the entrywise estimation error of our method provably has no dependence on the coherence under Gaussian noise (i.e., in the spiked Wigner model), and achieves the optimal estimation rate up to logarithmic factors. Simulations demonstrate that our method performs well under non-Gaussian noise and that an extension of our method to the case of a rank-$r$ signal matrix has little to no dependence on the coherence. In addition, we derive new metric entropy bounds for rank-$r$ singular subspaces under $\ell_{2,\infty}$ distance, which may be of independent interest. We use these new bounds to improve the best known lower bound for rank-$r$ eigenspace estimation under $\ell_{2,\infty}$ distance."
Poster,Coherent 3D Scene Diffusion From a Single RGB Image,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93816,"Manuel Dahnert, Angela Dai, Norman Müller, Matthias Niessner","We present a novel diffusion-based approach for coherent 3D scene reconstruction from a single RGB image. Our method utilizes an image-conditioned 3D scene diffusion model to simultaneously denoise the 3D poses and geometries of all objects within the scene.Motivated by the ill-posed nature of the task and to obtain consistent scene reconstruction results, we learn a generative scene prior by conditioning on all scene objects simultaneously to capture scene context and by allowing the model to learn inter-object relationships throughout the diffusion process.We further propose an efficient surface alignment loss to facilitate training even in the absence of full ground-truth annotation, which is common in publicly available datasets. This loss leverages an expressive shape representation, which enables direct point sampling from intermediate shape predictions.By framing the task of single RGB image 3D scene reconstruction as a conditional diffusion process, our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 12.04\% improvement in AP3D on SUN RGB-D and a 13.43\% increase in F-Score on Pix3D."
Poster,CoIN: A Benchmark of Continual Instruction Tuning for Multimodel Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97786,"Cheng Chen, Junchen Zhu, Xu Luo, Hengtao Shen, Jingkuan Song, Lianli Gao","Instruction tuning demonstrates impressive performance in adapting Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to follow task instructions and improve generalization ability.  By extending tuning across diverse tasks, MLLMs can further enhance their understanding of world knowledge and instruction intent. However, continual instruction tuning has been largely overlooked and there are no public benchmarks available. In this paper, we present CoIN, a comprehensive benchmark tailored for assessing the behavior of existing MLLMs under continual instruction tuning. CoIN comprises 10 meticulously crafted datasets spanning 8 tasks, ensuring diversity and serving as a robust evaluation framework to assess crucial aspects of continual instruction tuning, such as task order, instruction diversity and volume. Additionally, apart from traditional evaluation, we design another LLM-based metric to assess the knowledge preserved within MLLMs for reasoning. Following an in-depth evaluation of several MLLMs, we demonstrate that they still suffer catastrophic forgetting, and the failure in instruction alignment assumes the main responsibility, instead of reasoning knowledge forgetting.  To this end, we introduce MoELoRA which is effective in retaining the previous instruction alignment."
Poster,COLD: Causal reasOning in cLosed Daily activities,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96459,"Abhinav Joshi, areeb ahmad, Ashutosh Modi","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown state-of-the-art performance in a variety of tasks, including arithmetic and reasoning; however, to gauge the intellectual capabilities of LLMs, causal reasoning has become a reliable proxy for validating a general understanding of the mechanics and intricacies of the world similar to humans. Previous works in natural language processing (NLP) have either focused on open-ended causal reasoning via causal commonsense reasoning (CCR) or framed a symbolic representation-based question answering for theoretically backed-up analysis via a causal inference engine. The former adds an advantage of real-world grounding but lacks theoretically backed-up analysis/validation, whereas the latter is far from real-world grounding. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing the COLD (Causal reasOning in cLosed Daily activities) framework, which is built upon human understanding of daily real-world activities to reason about the causal nature of events. We show that the proposed framework facilitates the creation of enormous causal queries (∼ 9 million) and comes close to the mini-turing test, simulating causal reasoning to evaluate the understanding of a daily real-world task. We evaluate multiple LLMs on the created causal queries and find that causal reasoning is challenging even for activities trivial to humans. We further explore (the causal reasoning abilities of LLMs) using the backdoor criterion to determine the causal strength between events."
Poster,ColJailBreak: Collaborative Generation and Editing for Jailbreaking Text-to-Image Deep Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94287,"Yizhuo Ma, Shanmin Pang, Qi Guo, Tianyu Wei, Qing Guo","The commercial text-to-image deep generation models (e.g. DALL·E) can produce high-quality images based on input language descriptions. These models incorporate a black-box safety filter to prevent the generation of unsafe or unethical content, such as violent, criminal, or hateful imagery. Recent jailbreaking methods generate adversarial prompts capable of bypassing safety filters and producing unsafe content, exposing vulnerabilities in influential commercial models. However, once these adversarial prompts are identified, the safety filter can be updated to prevent the generation of unsafe images. In this work, we propose an effective, simple, and difficult-to-detect jailbreaking solution: generating safe content initially with normal text prompts and then editing the generations to embed unsafe content. The intuition behind this idea is that the deep generation model cannot reject safe generation with normal text prompts, while the editing models focus on modifying the local regions of images and do not involve a safety strategy. However, implementing such a solution is non-trivial, and we need to overcome several challenges: how to automatically confirm the normal prompt to replace the unsafe prompts, and how to effectively perform editable replacement and naturally generate unsafe content. In this work, we propose the collaborative generation and editing for jailbreaking text-to-image deep generation (ColJailBreak), which comprises three key components: adaptive normal safe substitution, inpainting-driven injection of unsafe content, and contrastive language-image-guided collaborative optimization. We validate our method on three datasets and compare it to two baseline methods. Our method could generate unsafe content through two commercial deep generation models including GPT-4 and DALL·E 2."
