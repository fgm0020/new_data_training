Poster,Efficient Federated Learning against Heterogeneous and Non-stationary Client Unavailability,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96094,"Ming Xiang, Stratis Ioannidis, Edmund Yeh, Carlee Joe-Wong, Lili Su","Addressing intermittent client availability is critical for the real-world deployment of federated learning algorithms. Most prior work either overlooks the potential non-stationarity in the dynamics of client unavailability or requires substantial memory/computation overhead. We study federated learning in the presence of heterogeneous and non-stationary client availability, which may occur when the deployment environments are uncertain, or the clients are mobile. The impacts of heterogeneity and non-stationarity on client unavailability can be significant, as we illustrate using FedAvg, the most widely adopted federated learning algorithm. We propose FedAWE, which includes novel algorithmic structures that (i) compensate for missed computations due to unavailability with only $O(1)$ additional memory and computation with respect to standard FedAvg, and (ii) evenly diffuse local updates within the federated learning system through implicit gossiping, despite being agnostic to non-stationary dynamics. We show that FedAWE converges to a stationary point of even non-convex objectives while achieving the desired linear speedup property. We corroborate our analysis with numerical experiments over diversified client unavailability dynamics on real-world data sets."
Poster,Efficient Graph Matching for Correlated Stochastic Block Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93707,"Shuwen Chai, Miklos Z. Racz","We study learning problems on correlated stochastic block models with two balanced communities. Our main result gives the first efficient algorithm for graph matching in this setting. In the most interesting regime where the average degree is logarithmic in the number of vertices, this algorithm correctly matches all but a vanishing fraction of vertices with high probability, whenever the edge correlation parameter $s$ satisfies $s^2 > \alpha \approx 0.338$, where $\alpha$ is Otter's tree-counting constant. Moreover, we extend this to an efficient algorithm for exact graph matching whenever this is information-theoretically possible, positively resolving an open problem of Rácz and Sridhar (NeurIPS 2021). Our algorithm generalizes the recent breakthrough work of Mao, Wu, Xu, and Yu (STOC 2023), which is based on centered subgraph counts of a large family of trees termed chandeliers. A major technical challenge that we overcome is dealing with the additional estimation errors that are necessarily present due to the fact that, in relevant parameter regimes, the latent community partition cannot be exactly recovered from a single graph. As an application of our results, we give an efficient algorithm for exact community recovery using multiple correlated graphs in parameter regimes where it is information-theoretically impossible to do so using just a single graph."
Poster,Efficient Large Multi-modal Models via Visual Context Compression,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96558,"Jieneng Chen, Luoxin Ye, Ju He, Zhaoyang Wang, Daniel Khashabi, Alan Yuille","While significant advancements have been made in compressed representations for text embeddings in large language models (LLMs), the compression of visual tokens in multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) has remained a largely overlooked area. In this work, we present the study on the analysis of redundancy concerning visual tokens and efficient training within these models. Our initial experimentsshow that eliminating up to 70% of visual tokens at the testing stage by simply average pooling only leads to a minimal 3% reduction in visual question answering accuracy on the GQA benchmark, indicating significant redundancy in visual context. Addressing this, we introduce Visual Context Compressor, which reduces the number of visual tokens to enhance training and inference efficiency without sacrificing performance. To minimize information loss caused by the compression on visual tokens while maintaining training efficiency, we develop LLaVolta as a light and staged training scheme that incorporates stage-wise visual context compression to progressively compress the visual tokens from heavily to lightly compression during training, yielding no loss of information when testing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances the performance of MLLMs in both image-language and video-language understanding, while also significantly cutting training costs and improving inference efficiency."
Poster,Efficient Leverage Score Sampling for Tensor Train Decomposition,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94191,"Vivek Bharadwaj, Beheshteh Toloueirakhshan, Osman Asif Malik, Guillaume Rabusseau","Tensor Train~(TT) decomposition is widely used in the machine learning and quantum physics communities as a popular tool to efficiently compress high-dimensional tensor data. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to accelerate computing the TT decomposition with the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm relying on exact leverage scores sampling. For this purpose, we propose a data structure that allows us to efficiently sample from the tensor with time complexity logarithmic in the product of the tensor dimensions. Our contribution specifically leverages the canonical form of the TT decomposition. By maintaining the canonical form through each iteration of ALS, we can efficiently compute (and sample from) the leverage scores, thus achieving significant speed-up in solving each sketched least-square problem. Experiments on synthetic and real data on dense and sparse tensors demonstrate that our method outperforms SVD-based and ALS-based algorithms."
Poster,Efficient Lifelong Model Evaluation in an Era of Rapid Progress,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96279,"Ameya Prabhu, Vishaal Udandarao, Philip Torr, Matthias Bethge, Adel Bibi, Samuel Albanie","Standardized benchmarks drive progress in machine learning. However, with repeated testing, the risk of overfitting grows as algorithms over-exploit benchmark idiosyncrasies. In our work, we seek to mitigate this challenge by compiling \textit{ever-expanding} large-scale benchmarks called \textit{Lifelong Benchmarks}. As exemplars of our approach, we create \textit{Lifelong-CIFAR10} and \textit{Lifelong-ImageNet}, containing (for now) 1.69M and 1.98M test samples, respectively. While reducing overfitting, lifelong benchmarks introduce a key challenge: the high cost of evaluating a growing number of models across an ever-expanding sample set. To address this challenge, we also introduce an efficient evaluation framework: \textit{Sort \& Search (S\&S)}, which reuses previously evaluated models by leveraging dynamic programming algorithms to selectively rank and sub-select test samples, enabling cost-effective lifelong benchmarking. Extensive empirical evaluations across $\sim$31,000 models demonstrate that \textit{S\&S} achieves highly-efficient approximate accuracy measurement, reducing compute cost from 180 GPU days to 5 GPU hours ($\sim$1000x reduction) on a single A100 GPU, with low approximation error. As such, lifelong benchmarks offer a robust, practical solution to the ``benchmark exhaustion'' problem."
Poster,Efficient LLM Jailbreak via Adaptive Dense-to-sparse Constrained Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94489,"Kai Hu, Weichen Yu, Yining Li, Tianjun Yao, Xiang Li, Wenhe Liu, Lijun Yu, Zhiqiang Shen, Kai Chen, Matt Fredrikson","Recent research indicates that large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to jailbreaking attacks that can generate harmful content. This paper introduces a novel token-level attack method, Adaptive Dense-to-Sparse Constrained Optimization (ADC), which has been shown to successfully jailbreak multiple open-source LLMs. Drawing inspiration from the difficulties of discrete token optimization, our method relaxes the discrete jailbreak optimization into a continuous optimization process while gradually increasing the sparsity of the optimizing vectors. This technique effectively bridges the gap between discrete and continuous space optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art token-level methods. On Harmbench, our approach achieves the highest attack success rate on seven out of eight LLMs compared to the latest jailbreak methods. \textcolor{red}{Trigger Warning: This paper contains model behavior that can be offensive in nature.}"
Poster,Efficient LLM Scheduling by Learning to Rank,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93127,"Yichao Fu, Siqi Zhu, Runlong Su, Aurick Qiao, Ion Stoica, Hao Zhang","In Large Language Model (LLM) inference, the output length of an LLM request is typically regarded as not known a priori. Consequently, most LLM serving systems employ a simple First-come-first-serve (FCFS) scheduling strategy, leading to Head-Of-Line (HOL) blocking and reduced throughput and service quality. In this paper, we reexamine this assumption -- we show that, although predicting the exact generation length of each request is infeasible, it is possible to predict the relative ranks of output lengths in a batch of requests, using learning to rank. The ranking information offers valuable guidance for scheduling requests. Building on this insight, we develop a novel scheduler for LLM inference and serving that can approximate the shortest-job-first (SJF) schedule better than existing approaches. We integrate this scheduler with the state-of-the-art LLM serving system and show significant performance improvement in several important applications: 2.8x lower latency in chatbot serving and 6.5x higher throughput in synthetic data generation.

Poster,Efficiently Learning Significant Fourier Feature Pairs for Statistical Independence Testing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96204,"Yixin Ren, Yewei Xia, Hao Zhang, Jihong Guan, Shuigeng Zhou","We propose a novel method to efficiently learn significant Fourier feature pairs for maximizing the power of Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion~(HSIC) based independence tests. We first reinterpret HSIC in the frequency domain, which reveals its limited discriminative power due to the inability to adapt to specific frequency-domain features under the current inflexible configuration. To remedy this shortcoming, we introduce a module of learnable Fourier features, thereby developing a new criterion. We then derive a finite sample estimate of the test power by modeling the behavior of the criterion, thus formulating an optimization objective for significant Fourier feature pairs learning. We show that this optimization objective can be computed in linear time (with respect to the sample size $n$), which ensures fast independence tests. We also prove the convergence property of the optimization objective and establish the consistency of the independence tests. Extensive empirical evaluation on both synthetic and real datasets validates our method's superiority in effectiveness and efficiency, particularly in handling high-dimensional data and dealing with large-scale scenarios."
Poster,Efficient Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding using Low-Rank Matrix Completion Algorithms,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96360,"Firas Trabelsi, David Vilar, Mara Finkelstein, Markus Freitag","Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding is a powerful decoding strategy widely used for text generation tasks but its quadratic computational complexity limits its practical application. This paper presents a novel approach for approximating MBR decoding using matrix completion techniques, focusing on a machine translation task. We formulate MBR decoding as a matrix completion problem, where the utility metric scores between candidate hypotheses and reference translations form a low-rank matrix. First we empirically show that the scores matrices indeed have a low-rank structure. Then we exploit this by only computing a random subset of the scores and efficiently recover the missing entries in the matrix by applying the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm, thereby enabling fast approximation of the MBR decoding process. Our experimental results on machine translation tasks demonstrate that the proposed method requires 1/16 utility metric computations compared to the vanilla MBR decoding while achieving equal translation quality measured by COMET on the WMT22 dataset (en<>de, en<>ru). We also benchmark our method against other approximation methods and we show significant gains in quality."
Poster,Efficient multi-prompt evaluation of LLMs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93925,"Felipe Maia Polo, Ronald Xu, Lucas Weber, Mírian Silva, Onkar Bhardwaj, Leshem Choshen, Allysson de Oliveira, Yuekai Sun, Mikhail Yurochkin","Most popular benchmarks for comparing LLMs rely on a limited set of prompt templates, which may not fully capture the LLMs’ abilities and can affect the reproducibility of results on leaderboards. Many recent works empirically verify prompt sensitivity and advocate for changes in LLM evaluation. In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating the performance distribution across many prompt variants instead of finding a single prompt to evaluate with. We introduce PromptEval, a method for estimating performance across a large set of prompts borrowing strength across prompts and examples to produce accurate estimates under practical evaluation budgets. The resulting distribution can be used to obtain performance quantiles to construct various robust performance metrics (e.g., top 95% quantile or median). We prove that PromptEval consistently estimates the performance distribution and demonstrate its efficacy empirically on three prominent LLM benchmarks: MMLU, BIG-bench Hard, and LMentry; for example, PromptEval can accurately estimate performance quantiles across 100 prompt templates on MMLU with a budget equivalent to two single-prompt evaluations. Moreover, we show how PromptEval can be useful in LLM-as-a-judge and best prompt identification applications."
