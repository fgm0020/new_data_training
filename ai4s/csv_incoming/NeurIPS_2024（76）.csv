Poster,ConceptFactory: Facilitate 3D Object Knowledge Annotation with Object Conceptualization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97559,"Jianhua Sun, Yuxuan Li, Longfei Xu, Nange Wang, Jiude Wei, Yining Zhang, Cewu Lu","We present ConceptFactory, a novel scope to facilitate more efficient annotation of 3D object knowledge by recognizing 3D objects through generalized concepts (i.e. object conceptualization), aiming at promoting machine intelligence to learn comprehensive object knowledge from both vision and robotics aspects. This idea originates from the findings in human cognition research that the perceptual recognition of objects can be explained as a process of arranging generalized geometric components (e.g. cuboids and cylinders). ConceptFactory consists of two critical parts: i) ConceptFactory Suite, a unified toolbox that adopts Standard Concept Template Library (STL-C) to drive a web-based platform for object conceptualization, and ii) ConceptFactory Asset, a large collection of conceptualized objects acquired using ConceptFactory suite. Our approach enables researchers to effortlessly acquire or customize extensive varieties of object knowledge to comprehensively study different object understanding tasks. We validate our idea on a wide range of benchmark tasks from both vision and robotics aspects with state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating the high quality and versatility of annotations provided by our approach.

Poster,ConceptMix: A Compositional Image Generation Benchmark with Controllable Difficulty,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97734,"Xindi Wu, Dingli Yu, Yangsibo Huang, Olga Russakovsky, Sanjeev Arora","Compositionality is a critical capability in Text-to-Image (T2I) models, as it reflects their ability to understand and combine multiple concepts from text descriptions. Existing evaluations of compositional capability rely heavily on human-designed text prompts or fixed templates, limiting their diversity and complexity, and yielding low discriminative power. We propose ConceptMix, a scalable, controllable, and customizable benchmark which automatically evaluates compositional generation ability of T2I models. This is done in two stages. First, ConceptMix generates the text prompts: concretely, using categories of visual concepts (e.g., objects, colors, shapes, spatial relationships), it randomly samples an object and k-tuples of visual concepts, then uses GPT-4o to generate text prompts for image generation based on these sampled concepts. Second, ConceptMix evaluates the images generated in response to these prompts: concretely, it checks how many of the k concepts actually appeared in the image by generating one question per visual concept and using a strong VLM to answer them. Through administering ConceptMix to a diverse set of T2I models (proprietary as well as open ones) using increasing values of k, we show that our ConceptMix has higher discrimination power than earlier benchmarks. Specifically, ConceptMix reveals that the performance of several models, especially open models, drops dramatically with increased k. Importantly, it also provides insight into the lack of prompt diversity in widely-used training datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive human studies to validate the design of ConceptMix and compare our automatic grading with human judgement. We hope it will guide future T2I model development."
Poster,Conditional Controllable Image Fusion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95168,"Bing Cao, Xingxin Xu, Pengfei Zhu, Qilong Wang, Qinghua Hu","Image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from multiple input images acquired through various sources to synthesize a new fused image. Existing methods usually employ distinct constraint designs tailored to specific scenes, forming fixed fusion paradigms. However, this data-driven fusion approach is challenging to deploy in varying scenarios, especially in rapidly changing environments. To address this issue, we propose a conditional controllable fusion (CCF) framework for general image fusion tasks without specific training. Due to the dynamic differences of different samples, our CCF employs specific fusion constraints for each individual in practice. Given the powerful generative capabilities of the denoising diffusion model, we first inject the specific constraints into the pre-trained DDPM as adaptive fusion conditions. The appropriate conditions are dynamically selected to ensure the fusion process remains responsive to the specific requirements in each reverse diffusion stage. Thus, CCF enables conditionally calibrating the fused images step by step. Extensive experiments validate our effectiveness in general fusion tasks across diverse scenarios against the competing methods without additional training. The code is publicly available."
Poster,Conditional Density Estimation with Histogram Trees,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96586,"Lincen Yang, Matthijs van Leeuwen","Conditional density estimation (CDE) goes beyond regression by modeling the full conditional distribution, providing a richer understanding of the data than just the conditional mean in regression. This makes CDE particularly useful in critical application domains. However, interpretable CDE methods are understudied. Current methods typically employ kernel-based approaches, using kernel functions directly for kernel density estimation or as basis functions in linear models. In contrast, despite their conceptual simplicity and visualization suitability, tree-based methods---which are arguably more comprehensible---have been largely overlooked for CDE tasks. Thus, we propose the Conditional Density Tree (CDTree), a fully non-parametric model consisting of a decision tree in which each leaf is formed by a histogram model. Specifically, we formalize the problem of learning a CDTree using the minimum description length (MDL) principle, which eliminates the need for tuning the hyperparameter for regularization. Next, we propose an iterative algorithm that, although greedily, searches the optimal histogram for every possible node split. Our experiments demonstrate that, in comparison to existing interpretable CDE methods, CDTrees are both more accurate (as measured by the log-loss) and more robust against irrelevant features. Further, our approach leads to smaller tree sizes than existing tree-based models, which benefits interpretability."
Poster,Conditional Generative Models are Sufficient to Sample from Any Causal  Effect Estimand,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93180,"Md Musfiqur Rahman, Matt Jordan, Murat Kocaoglu","Causal inference from observational data plays critical role in many applications in trustworthy machine learning.While sound and complete algorithms exist to compute causal effects, many of them assume access to conditional likelihoods, which is difficult to estimate for high-dimensional (particularly image) data. Researchers have alleviated this issue by simulating causal relations with neural models. However, when we have high-dimensional variables in the causal graph along with some unobserved confounders, no existing work can effectively sample from the un/conditional interventional distributions. In this work, we show how to sample from any identifiable interventional distribution given an arbitrary causal graph through a sequence of push-forward computations of conditional generative models, such as diffusion models. Our proposed algorithm follows the recursive steps of the existing likelihood-based identification algorithms to train a set of feed-forward models, and connect them in a specific way to sample from the desired distribution. We conduct experiments on a Colored MNIST dataset having both the treatment ($X$) and the target variables ($Y$) as images and sample from $P(y|do(x))$. Our algorithm also enables us to conduct a causal analysis to evaluate spurious correlations among input features of generative models pre-trained on the CelebA dataset. Finally, we generate high-dimensional interventional samples from the MIMIC-CXR dataset involving text and image variables."
Poster,Conditional Outcome Equivalence: A Quantile Alternative to CATE,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93302,"Josh Givens, Henry Reeve, Song Liu, Katarzyna Reluga","The conditional quantile treatment effect (CQTE) can provide insight into the effect of a treatment beyond the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). This ability to provide information over multiple quantiles of the response makes the CQTE especially valuable in cases where the effect of a treatment is not well-modelled by a location shift, even conditionally on the covariates. Nevertheless, the estimation of the CQTE is challenging and often depends upon the smoothness of the individual quantiles as a function of the covariates rather than smoothness of the CQTE itself. This is in stark contrast to the CATE where it is possible to obtain high-quality estimates  which have less dependency upon the smoothness of the nuisance parameters when the CATE itself is smooth. Moreover, relative smoothness of the CQTE lacks the interpretability of smoothness of the CATE making it less clear whether it is a reasonable assumption to make. We combine the desirable properties of the CATE and CQTE by considering a new estimand, the conditional quantile comparator (CQC). The CQC not only retains information about the whole treatment distribution, similar to the CQTE, but also having more natural examples of smoothness and is able to leverage simplicity in an auxiliary estimand. We provide finite sample bounds on the error of our estimator, demonstrating its ability to exploit simplicity. We validate our theory in numerical simulations which show that our method produces more accurate estimates than baselines. Finally, we apply our methodology to a study on the effect of employment incentives on earnings across different age groups. We see that our method is able to reveal heterogeneity of the effect across different quantiles."
Poster,Conditional Synthesis of 3D Molecules with Time Correction Sampler,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94127,"Hojung Jung, Youngrok Park, Laura Schmid, Jaehyeong Jo, Dongkyu Lee, Bongsang Kim, Se-Young Yun, Jinwoo Shin","Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various domains, including molecular generation. However, conditional molecular generation remains a fundamental challenge due to an intrinsic trade-off between targeting specific chemical properties and generating meaningful samples from the data distribution. In this work, we present Time-Aware Conditional Synthesis (TACS), a novel approach to conditional generation on diffusion models. It integrates adaptively controlled plug-and-play ""online"" guidance into a diffusion model, driving samples toward the desired properties while maintaining validity and stability. A key component of our algorithm is our new type of diffusion sampler, Time Correction Sampler (TCS), which is used to control guidance and ensure that the generated molecules remain on the correct manifold at each reverse step of the diffusion process at the same time. Our proposed method demonstrates significant performance in conditional 3D molecular generation and offers a promising approach towards inverse molecular design, potentially facilitating advancements in drug discovery, materials science, and other related fields."
Poster,Conditioning non-linear and infinite-dimensional diffusion processes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95970,"Elizabeth L. Baker, Gefan Yang, Michael Severinsen, Christy Hipsley, Stefan Sommer","Generative diffusion models and many stochastic models in science and engineering naturally live in infinite dimensions before discretisation. To incorporate observed data for statistical and learning tasks, one needs to condition on observations. While recent work has treated conditioning linear processes in infinite dimensions, conditioning non-linear processes in infinite dimensions has not been explored. This paper conditions function valued stochastic processes without prior discretisation. To do so, we use an infinite-dimensional version of Girsanov's theorem to condition a function-valued stochastic process, leading to a stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the conditioned process involving the score. We apply this technique to do time series analysis for shapes of organisms in evolutionary biology, where we discretise via the Fourier basis and then learn the coefficients of the score function with score matching methods."
Poster,CondTSF: One-line Plugin of Dataset Condensation for Time Series Forecasting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95627,"Jianrong Ding, Zhanyu Liu, Guanjie Zheng, Haiming Jin, Linghe Kong","\textit{Dataset condensation} is a newborn technique that generates a small dataset that can be used in training deep neural networks (DNNs) to lower storage and training costs. The objective of dataset condensation is to ensure that the model trained with the synthetic dataset can perform comparably to the model trained with full datasets. However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on classification tasks, posing challenges in their adaptation to time series forecasting (TS-forecasting). This challenge arises from disparities in the evaluation of synthetic data. In classification, the synthetic data is considered well-distilled if the model trained with the full dataset and the model trained with the synthetic dataset yield identical labels for the same input, regardless of variations in output logits distribution. Conversely, in TS-forecasting, the effectiveness of synthetic data distillation is determined by the distance between predictions of the two models. The synthetic data is deemed well-distilled only when all data points within the predictions are similar. Consequently, TS-forecasting has a more rigorous evaluation methodology compared to classification. To mitigate this gap, we theoretically analyze the optimization objective of dataset condensation for TS-forecasting and propose a new one-line plugin of dataset condensation for TS-forecasting designated as Dataset \textbf{Cond}ensation for \textbf{T}ime \textbf{S}eries \textbf{F}orecasting (CondTSF) based on our analysis. Plugging CondTSF into previous dataset condensation methods facilitates a reduction in the distance between the predictions of the model trained with the full dataset and the model trained with the synthetic dataset, thereby enhancing performance. We conduct extensive experiments on eight commonly used time series datasets. CondTSF consistently improves the performance of all previous dataset condensation methods across all datasets, particularly at low condensing ratios."
Poster,Confidence Calibration of Classifiers with Many Classes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94258,"Adrien Le Coz, Stéphane Herbin, Faouzi Adjed","For classification models based on neural networks, the maximum predicted class probability is often used as a confidence score. This score rarely predicts well the probability of making a correct prediction and requires a post-processing calibration step. However, many confidence calibration methods fail for problems with many classes. To address this issue, we transform the problem of calibrating a multiclass classifier into calibrating a single surrogate binary classifier.  This approach allows for more efficient use of standard calibration methods. We evaluate our approach on numerous neural networks used for image or text classification and show that it significantly enhances existing calibration methods."
