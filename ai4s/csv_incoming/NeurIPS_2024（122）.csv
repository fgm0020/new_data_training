Poster,EAI: Emotional Decision-Making of LLMs in Strategic Games and Ethical Dilemmas,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96364,"Mikhail Mozikov, Nikita Severin, Valeria Bodishtianu, Maria Glushanina, Ivan Nasonov, Daniil Orekhov, Pekhotin Vladislav, Ivan Makovetskiy, Mikhail Baklashkin, Vasily Lavrentyev, Akim Tsvigun, Denis Turdakov, Tatiana Shavrina, Andrey Savchenko, Ilya Makarov","One of the urgent tasks of artificial intelligence is to assess the safety and alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human behavior. Conventional verification only in pure natural language processing benchmarks can be insufficient. Since emotions often influence human decisions, this paper examines LLM alignment in complex strategic and ethical environments, providing an in-depth analysis of the drawbacks of our psychology and the emotional impact on decision-making in humans and LLMs. We introduce the novel EAI framework for integrating emotion modeling into LLMs to examine the emotional impact on ethics and LLM-based decision-making in various strategic games, including bargaining and repeated games. Our experimental study with various LLMs demonstrated that emotions can significantly alter the ethical decision-making landscape of LLMs, highlighting the need for robust mechanisms to ensure consistent ethical standards. Our game-theoretic analysis revealed that LLMs are susceptible to emotional biases influenced by model size, alignment strategies, and primary pretraining language. Notably, these biases often diverge from typical human emotional responses, occasionally leading to unexpected drops in cooperation rates, even under positive emotional influence. Such behavior complicates the alignment of multiagent systems, emphasizing the need for benchmarks that can rigorously evaluate the degree of emotional alignment. Our framework provides a foundational basis for developing such benchmarks."
Poster,EASI: Evolutionary Adversarial Simulator Identification for Sim-to-Real Transfer,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96071,"Haoyu Dong, Huiqiao Fu, Wentao Xu, Zhehao Zhou, Chunlin Chen","Reinforcement Learning (RL) controllers have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex robot control tasks. However, the presence of reality gap often leads to poor performance when deploying policies trained in simulation directly onto real robots. Previous sim-to-real algorithms like Domain Randomization (DR) requires domain-specific expertise and suffers from issues such as reduced control performance and high training costs. In this work, we introduce Evolutionary Adversarial Simulator Identification (EASI), a novel approach that combines Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Evolutionary Strategy (ES) to address sim-to-real challenges. Specifically, we consider the problem of sim-to-real as a search problem, where ES acts as a generator in adversarial competition with a neural network discriminator, aiming to find physical parameter distributions that make the state transitions between simulation and reality as similar as possible. The discriminator serves as the fitness function, guiding the evolution of the physical parameter distributions. EASI features simplicity, low cost, and high fidelity, enabling the construction of a more realistic simulator with minimal requirements for real-world data, thus aiding in transferring simulated-trained policies to the real world. We demonstrate the performance of EASI in both sim-to-sim and sim-to-real tasks, showing superior performance compared to existing sim-to-real algorithms."
Poster,Easy2Hard-Bench: Standardized Difficulty Labels for Profiling LLM Performance and Generalization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97554,"Mucong Ding, Chenghao Deng, Jocelyn Choo, Zichu Wu, Aakriti Agrawal, Avi Schwarzschild, Tianyi Zhou, Tom Goldstein, John Langford, Animashree Anandkumar, Furong Huang","Despite the abundance of datasets available for assessing large language models (LLMs), the scarcity of continuous and reliable difficulty labels for individual data points, in most cases, curtails their capacity to benchmark model generalization performance across different levels of complexity. Addressing this limitation, we present Easy2Hard, an innovative collection of 6 benchmark datasets featuring standardized difficulty labels spanning a wide range of domains, such as mathematics and programming problems, chess puzzles, and reasoning questions, providing a much-needed tool for those in demand of a dataset with varying degrees of difficulty for LLM assessment. We estimate the difficulty of individual problems by leveraging the performance data of many human subjects and LLMs on prominent leaderboards. Harnessing the rich human performance data, we employ widely recognized difficulty ranking systems, including the Item Response Theory (IRT) and Glicko-2 models, to uniformly assign difficulty scores to problems. The Easy2Hard datasets distinguish themselves from previous collections by incorporating a significantly higher proportion of challenging problems, presenting a novel and demanding test for state-of-the-art LLMs. Through extensive experiments conducted with six state-of-the-art LLMs on the Easy2Hard datasets, we offer valuable insights into their performance and generalization capabilities across varying degrees of difficulty, setting the stage for future research in LLM generalization."
Poster,Easy Regional Contrastive Learning of Expressive Fashion Representations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94509,"Daiqing Qi, Handong Zhao, Sheng Li","When learning vision-language models (VLM) for the fashion domain, most existing works design new architectures from vanilla BERT with additional objectives, or perform dense multi-task learning with fashion-specific tasks. Though progress has been made, their architecture or objectives are often intricate and the extendibility is limited.By contrast, with simple architecture (comprising only two unimodal encoders) and just the contrastive objective, popular pre-trained VL models (e.g., CLIP) achieve superior performance in general domains, which are further easily extended to downstream tasks.However, inheriting such benefits of CLIP in the fashion domain is non-trivial in the presence of the notable domain gap. Empirically, we find that directly finetuning on fashion data leads CLIP to frequently ignore minor yet important details such as logos and composition, which are critical in fashion tasks such as retrieval and captioning.In this work, to maintain CLIP's simple architecture and objective while explicitly attending to fashion details, we propose $E^2$: Easy Regional Contrastive Learning of Expressive Fashion Representations.$E^2$ introduces only a few selection tokens and fusion blocks (just 1.9\% additional parameters in total) with only contrastive losses. Despite lightweight, in our primary focus, cross-modal retrieval, $E^2$ notably outperforms existing fashion VLMs with various fashion-specific objectives.Moreover, thanks to CLIP's widespread use in downstream tasks in general domains (e.g., zero-shot composed image retrieval and image captioning), our model can easily extend these models  from general domain to the fashion domain with notable improvement.To conduct a comprehensive evaluation, we further collect data from Amazon Reviews to build a new dataset for cross-modal retrieval in the fashion domain."
Poster,Easy-to-Hard Generalization: Scalable Alignment Beyond Human Supervision,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93466,"Zhiqing Sun, Longhui Yu, Yikang Shen, Weiyang Liu, Yiming Yang, Sean Welleck, Chuang Gan","Current AI alignment methodologies rely on human-provided demonstrations or judgments, and the learned capabilities of AI systems would be upper-bounded by human capabilities as a result. This raises a challenging research question: How can we keep improving the systems when their capabilities have surpassed the levels of humans? This paper answers this question in the context of tackling hard reasoning tasks (e.g., level 4-5 MATH problems) via learning from human annotations on easier tasks (e.g., level 1-3 MATH problems), which we term as easy-to-hard generalization. Our key insight is that an evaluator (reward model) trained on supervisions for easier tasks can be effectively used for scoring candidate solutions of harder tasks and hence facilitating easy-to-hard generalization over different levels of tasks. Based on this insight, we propose a novel approach to scalable alignment, which firstly trains the (process-supervised) reward models on easy problems (e.g., level 1-3), and then uses them to evaluate the performance of policy models on hard problems. We show that such easy-to-hard generalization from evaluators can enable easy-to-hard generalizations in generators either through re-ranking or reinforcement learning (RL). Notably, our process-supervised 7b RL model and 34b model (reranking@1024) achieves an accuracy of 34.0% and 52.5% on MATH500, respectively, despite only using human supervision on easy problems. Our approach suggests a promising path toward AI systems that advance beyond the frontier of human supervision."
Poster,ECLipsE: Efficient Compositional Lipschitz Constant Estimation for Deep Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96554,"Yuezhu Xu, S Sivaranjani","The Lipschitz constant plays a crucial role in certifying the robustness of neural networks to input perturbations. Since calculating the exact Lipschitz constant is NP-hard, efforts have been made to obtain tight upper bounds on the Lipschitz constant. Typically, this involves solving a large matrix verification problem, the computational cost of which grows significantly for both deeper and wider networks. In this paper, we provide a compositional approach to estimate Lipschitz constants for deep feed-forward neural networks. We first obtain an exact decomposition of the large matrix verification problem into smaller sub-problems. Then, leveraging the underlying cascade structure of the network, we develop two algorithms. The first algorithm explores the geometric features of the problem and enables us to provide Lipschitz estimates that are comparable to existing methods by solving small semidefinite programs (SDPs) that are only as large as the size of each layer. The second algorithm relaxes these sub-problems and provides a closed-form solution to each sub-problem for extremely fast estimation, altogether eliminating the need to solve SDPs. The two algorithms represent different levels of trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach provides a steep reduction in computation time (as much as several thousand times faster, depending on the algorithm for deeper networks) while yielding Lipschitz bounds that are very close to or even better than those achieved by state-of-the-art approaches in a broad range of experiments. In summary, our approach considerably advances the scalability and efficiency of certifying neural network robustness, making it particularly attractive for online learning tasks."
Poster,ECMamba: Consolidating Selective State Space Model with Retinex Guidance for Efficient Multiple Exposure Correction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93749,"Wei Dong, Han Zhou, Yulun Zhang, Xiaohong Liu, Jun Chen","Exposure Correction (EC) aims to recover proper exposure conditions for images captured under over-exposure or under-exposure scenarios. While existing deep learning models have shown promising results, few have fully embedded Retinex theory into their architecture, highlighting a gap in current methodologies. Additionally, the balance between high performance and efficiency remains an under-explored problem for exposure correction task. Inspired by Mamba which demonstrates powerful and highly efficient sequence modeling, we introduce a novel framework based on \textbf{Mamba} for \textbf{E}xposure \textbf{C}orrection (\textbf{ECMamba}) with dual pathways, each dedicated to the restoration of reflectance and illumination map, respectively. Specifically, we firstly derive the Retinex theory and we train a Retinex estimator capable of mapping inputs into two intermediary spaces, each approximating the target reflectance and illumination map, respectively. This setup facilitates the refined restoration process of the subsequent \textbf{E}xposure \textbf{C}orrection \textbf{M}amba \textbf{M}odule (\textbf{ECMM}). Moreover, we develop a novel \textbf{2D S}elective \textbf{S}tate-space layer guided by \textbf{Retinex} information (\textbf{Retinex-SS2D}) as the core operator of \textbf{ECMM}. This architecture incorporates an innovative 2D scanning strategy based on deformable feature aggregation, thereby enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness. Extensive experiment results and comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the outstanding performance and the importance of each component of our proposed ECMamba.

Poster,e-COP : Episodic Constrained Optimization of Policies,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96592,"Akhil Agnihotri, Rahul Jain, Deepak Ramachandran, Sahil Singla","In this paper, we present the e-COP algorithm, the first policy optimization algorithm for constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) in episodic (finite horizon) settings. Such formulations are applicable when there are separate sets of optimization criteria and constraints on a system's behavior. We approach this problem by first establishing a policy difference lemma for the episodic setting, which provides the theoretical foundation for the algorithm. Then, we propose to combine a set of established and novel solution ideas to yield the e-COP  algorithm that is easy to implement and numerically stable, and provide a theoretical guarantee on optimality under certain scaling assumptions. Through extensive empirical analysis using benchmarks in the Safety Gym suite, we show that our algorithm has similar or better performance than SoTA (non-episodic) algorithms adapted for the episodic setting. The scalability of the algorithm  opens the door to its application in safety-constrained Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for Large Language or Diffusion Models."
Poster,Edit Distance Robust Watermarks via Indexing Pseudorandom Codes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95963,"Noah Golowich, Ankur Moitra","Motivated by the problem of detecting AI-generated text, we consider the problem of watermarking the output of language models with provable guarantees. We aim for watermarks which satisfy: (a) undetectability, a cryptographic notion introduced by Christ, Gunn, & Zamir (2023) which stipulates that it is computationally hard to distinguish watermarked language model outputs from the model's actual output distribution; and (b) robustness to channels which introduce a constant fraction of adversarial insertions, substitutions, and deletions to the watermarked text. Earlier schemes could only handle stochastic substitutions and deletions, and thus we are aiming for a more natural and appealing robustness guarantee that holds with respect to edit distance.  Our main result is a watermarking scheme which achieves both (a) and (b) when the alphabet size for the language model is allowed to grow as a polynomial in the security parameter. To derive such a scheme, we follow an approach introduced by Christ & Gunn (2024), which proceeds via first constructing pseudorandom codes satisfying undetectability and robustness properties analogous to those above; our codes have the additional benefit of relying on weaker computational assumptions than used in previous work.   Then we show that there is a generic transformation from such codes over large alphabets to watermarking schemes for arbitrary language models."
Poster,EDT: An Efficient Diffusion Transformer Framework Inspired by Human-like Sketching,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95496,"Xinwang Chen, Ning Liu, Yichen Zhu, Feifei Feng, Jian Tang","Transformer-based Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have shown more potential than CNN-based DPMs, yet their extensive computational requirements hinder widespread practical applications. To reduce the computation budget of transformer-based DPMs, this work proposes the Efficient Diffusion Transformer (EDT) framework. This framework includes a lightweight-design diffusion model architecture, and a training-free Attention Modulation Matrix and its alternation arrangement in EDT inspired by human-like sketching. Additionally, we propose a token relation-enhanced masking training strategy tailored explicitly for EDT to augment its token relation learning capability. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of EDT. The EDT framework reduces training and inference costs and surpasses existing transformer-based diffusion models in image synthesis performance, thereby achieving a significant overall enhancement. With lower FID, EDT-S, EDT-B, and EDT-XL attained speed-ups of 3.93x, 2.84x, and 1.92x respectively in the training phase, and 2.29x, 2.29x, and 2.22x respectively in inference, compared to the corresponding sizes of MDTv2.
