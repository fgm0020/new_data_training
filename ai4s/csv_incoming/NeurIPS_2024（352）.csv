Poster,Safety through feedback in Constrained RL,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94830,"Shashank Reddy Chirra, Pradeep Varakantham, Praveen Paruchuri","In safety-critical RL settings, the inclusion of an additional cost function is often favoured over the arduous task of modifying the reward function to ensure the agent's safe behaviour. However, designing or evaluating such a cost function can be prohibitively expensive. For instance, in the domain of self-driving, designing a cost function that encompasses all unsafe behaviours (e.g., aggressive lane changes, risky overtakes) is inherently complex, it must also consider all the actors present in the scene making it expensive to evaluate. In such scenarios, the cost function can be learned from feedback collected offline in between training rounds. This feedback can be system generated or elicited from a human observing the training process. Previous approaches have not been able to scale to complex environments and are constrained to receiving feedback at the state level which can be expensive to collect. To this end, we introduce an approach that scales to more complex domains and extends beyond state-level feedback, thus, reducing the burden on the evaluator. Inferring the cost function in such settings poses challenges, particularly in assigning credit to individual states based on trajectory-level feedback. To address this, we propose a surrogate objective that transforms the problem into a state-level supervised classification task with noisy labels, which can be solved efficiently. Additionally, it is often infeasible to collect feedback for every trajectory generated by the agent, hence, two fundamental questions arise: (1) Which trajectories should be presented to the human? and (2) How many trajectories are necessary for effective learning? To address these questions, we introduce a \textit{novelty-based sampling} mechanism that selectively involves the evaluator only when the the agent encounters a \textit{novel} trajectory, and discontinues querying once the trajectories are no longer \textit{novel}. We showcase the efficiency of our method through experimentation on several benchmark Safety Gymnasium environments and realistic self-driving scenarios. Our method demonstrates near-optimal performance, comparable to when the cost function is known, by relying solely on trajectory-level feedback across multiple domains. This highlights both the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.

Poster,Safetywashing: Do AI Safety Benchmarks Actually Measure Safety Progress?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97637,"Richard Ren, Steven Basart, Adam Khoja, Alice Gatti, Long Phan, Xuwang Yin, Mantas Mazeika, Alexander Pan, Gabriel Mukobi, Ryan Kim, Stephen Fitz, Dan Hendrycks","Performance on popular ML benchmarks is highly correlated with model scale, suggesting that most benchmarks tend to measure a similar underlying factor of general model capabilities. However, substantial research effort remains devoted to designing new benchmarks, many of which claim to measure novel phenomena. In the spirit of the Bitter Lesson, we leverage spectral analysis to measure an underlying capabilities component, the direction in benchmark-performance-space which explains most variation in model performance. In an extensive analysis of existing safety benchmarks, we find that variance in model performance on many safety benchmarks is largely explained by the capabilities component. In response, we argue that safety research should prioritize metrics which are not highly correlated with scale. Our work provides a lens to analyze both novel safety benchmarks and novel safety methods, which we hope will enable future work to make differential progress on safety."
Poster,SafeWorld: Geo-Diverse Safety Alignment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94887,"Da Yin, Haoyi Qiu, Kung-Hsiang Huang, Kai-Wei Chang, Nanyun Peng","In the rapidly evolving field of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring safety is a crucial and widely discussed topic. However, existing works often overlooks the geo-diversity of cultural and legal standards across the world. To reveal the chal5 lenges posed by geo-diverse safety standards, we introduce SafeWorld, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs’ ability to generate responses that are not only helpful but also culturally sensitive and legally compliant across diverse global contexts. SafeWorld encompasses 2,775 test user queries, each grounded in high-quality, human-verified cultural norms and legal policies from 50 countries and 493 regions/races. On top of it, we propose a multi-dimensional automatic safety evaluation framework that assesses the contextual appropriateness, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of responses. Our evaluations reveal that current LLMs struggle to meet these criteria effectively. To enhance LLMs’ alignment with geo-diverse safety standards, we synthesize helpful preference pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) alignment. The preference pair construction aims to encourage LLMs to behave appropriately and provide precise references to relevant cultural norms and policies when necessary. Our trained SafeWorldLM outperforms all competing models, including GPT-4o on all the three evaluation dimensions by a large margin. Global human evaluators also note a nearly 20% higher winning rate in helpfulness and harmfulness evaluation."
Poster,Saliency-driven Experience Replay for Continual Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96375,"Giovanni Bellitto, Federica Proietto Salanitri, Matteo Pennisi, Matteo Boschini, Lorenzo Bonicelli, Angelo Porrello, SIMONE CALDERARA, Simone Palazzo, Concetto Spampinato","We present Saliency-driven Experience Replay - SER - a biologically-plausible approach based on replicating human visual saliency to enhance classification models in continual learning settings. Inspired by neurophysiological evidence that the primary visual cortex does not contribute to object manifold untangling for categorization and that primordial saliency biases are still embedded in the modern brain, we propose to employ auxiliary saliency prediction features as a modulation signal to drive and stabilize the learning of a sequence of non-i.i.d. classification tasks. Experimental results confirm that SER effectively enhances the performance (in some cases up to about twenty percent points) of state-of-the-art continual learning methods, both in class-incremental and task-incremental settings. Moreover, we show that saliency-based modulation successfully encourages the learning of features that are more robust to the presence of spurious features and to adversarial attacks than baseline methods.

Poster,Samba: Severity-aware Recurrent Modeling for Cross-domain Medical Image Grading,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94567,"Qi Bi, Jingjun Yi, Hao Zheng, Wei Ji, Haolan Zhan, Yawen Huang, Yuexiang Li, Yefeng Zheng","Disease grading is a crucial task in medical image analysis. Due to the continuous progression of diseases, i.e., the variability within the same level and the similarity between adjacent stages, accurate grading is highly challenging.Furthermore, in real-world scenarios, models trained on limited source domain datasets should also be capable of handling data from unseen target domains.Due to the cross-domain variants, the feature distribution between source and unseen target domains can be dramatically different, leading to a substantial  decrease in model performance.To address these challenges in cross-domain disease grading, we propose a Severity-aware Recurrent Modeling (Samba) method in this paper.As the core objective of most staging tasks is to identify the most severe lesions, which may only occupy a small portion of the image, we propose to encode image patches in a sequential and recurrent manner.Specifically, a state space model is tailored to store and transport the severity information by hidden states.Moreover, to mitigate the impact of cross-domain variants, an Expectation-Maximization (EM) based state recalibration mechanism is designed to map the patch embeddings into a more compact space.We model the feature distributions of different lesions through the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and reconstruct the intermediate features based on learnable severity bases.Extensive experiments show the proposed Samba outperforms the VMamba baseline by an average accuracy of 23.5\%, 5.6\% and 4.1\% on the cross-domain grading of fatigue fracture, breast cancer and diabetic retinopathy, respectively.

Poster,SAM-Guided Masked Token Prediction for 3D Scene Understanding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95998,"Zhimin Chen, Liang Yang, Yingwei Li, Longlong Jing, Bing Li","Foundation models have significantly enhanced 2D task performance, and recent works like Bridge3D have successfully applied these models to improve 3D scene understanding through knowledge distillation, marking considerable advancements. Nonetheless, challenges such as the misalignment between 2D and 3D representations and the persistent long-tail distribution in 3D datasets still restrict the effectiveness of knowledge distillation from 2D to 3D using foundation models. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel SAM-guided tokenization method that seamlessly aligns 3D transformer structures with region-level knowledge distillation, replacing the traditional KNN-based tokenization techniques. Additionally, we implement a group-balanced re-weighting strategy to effectively address the long-tail problem in knowledge distillation. Furthermore, inspired by the recent success of masked feature prediction, our framework incorporates a two-stage masked token prediction process in which the student model predicts both the global embeddings and token-wise local embeddings derived from the teacher models trained in the first stage. Our methodology has been validated across multiple datasets, including SUN RGB-D, ScanNet, and S3DIS, for tasks like 3D object detection and semantic segmentation. The results demonstrate significant improvements over current state-of-the-art self-supervised methods, establishing new benchmarks in this field."
Poster,SAMPa: Sharpness-aware Minimization Parallelized,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95776,"Wanyun Xie, Thomas Pethick, Volkan Cevher","Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has been shown to improve the generalization of neural networks. However, each SAM update requires _sequentially_ computing two gradients, effectively doubling the per-iteration cost compared to base optimizers like SGD. We propose a simple modification of SAM, termed SAMPa, which allows us to fully parallelize the two gradient computations. SAMPa achieves a twofold speedup of SAM under the assumption that communication costs between devices are negligible. Empirical results show that SAMPa ranks among the most efficient variants of SAM in terms of computational time. Additionally, our method consistently outperforms SAM across both vision and language tasks. Notably, SAMPa theoretically maintains convergence guarantees even for  _fixed_ perturbation sizes, which is established through a novel Lyapunov function. We in fact arrive at SAMPa by treating this convergence guarantee as a hard requirement---an approach we believe is promising for developing SAM-based methods in general. Our code is available at https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/SAMPa."
Poster,SampDetox: Black-box Backdoor Defense via Perturbation-based Sample Detoxification,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94718,"Yanxin Yang, Chentao Jia, DengKe Yan, Ming Hu, Tianlin Li, Xiaofei Xie, Xian Wei, Mingsong Chen","The advancement of Machine Learning has enabled the widespread deployment of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) applications. However, the untrustworthy nature of third-party ML services poses backdoor threats. Existing defenses in MLaaS are limited by their reliance on training samples or white-box model analysis, highlighting the need for a black-box backdoor purification method. In our paper, we attempt to use diffusion models for purification by introducing noise in a forward diffusion process to destroy backdoors and recover clean samples through a reverse generative process. However, since a higher noise also destroys the semantics of the original samples, it still results in a low restoration performance. To investigate the effectiveness of noise in eliminating different types of backdoors, we conducted a preliminary study, which demonstrates that backdoors with low visibility can be easily destroyed by lightweight noise and those with high visibility need to be destroyed by high noise but can be easily detected. Based on the study, we propose SampDetox, which strategically combines lightweight and high noise. SampDetox applies weak noise to eliminate low-visibility backdoors and compares the structural similarity between the recovered and original samples to localize high-visibility backdoors. Intensive noise is then applied to these localized areas, destroying the high-visibility backdoors while preserving global semantic information. As a result, detoxified samples can be used for inference, even by poisoned models. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SampDetox in defending against various state-of-the-art backdoor attacks."
Poster,Sample and Computationally Efficient Robust Learning of Gaussian Single-Index Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95528,"Puqian Wang, Nikos Zarifis, Ilias Diakonikolas, Jelena Diakonikolas","A single-index model (SIM) is a function of the form $\sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\ast} \cdot \mathbf{x})$, where$\sigma: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is a known link function and $\mathbf{w}^{\ast}$ is a hidden unit vector. We study the task of learning SIMs in the agnostic (a.k.a. adversarial label noise) model with respect to the $L^2_2$-loss under the Gaussian distribution. Our main result is a sample and computationally efficient agnostic proper learner that attains $L^2_2$-error of $O(\mathrm{OPT})+\epsilon$, where $\mathrm{OPT}$ is the optimal loss. The sample complexity of our algorithm is $\tilde{O}(d^{\lceil k^{\ast}/2\rceil}+d/\epsilon)$, where $k^{\ast}$ is the information-exponent of $\sigma$ corresponding to the degree of its first non-zero Hermite coefficient. This sample bound nearly matches known CSQ lower bounds, even in the realizable setting. Prior algorithmic work in this setting had focused on learning in the realizable case or in the presence of semi-random noise. Prior computationally efficient robust learners required significantly stronger assumptions on the link function."
Poster,Sample Complexity of Algorithm Selection Using Neural Networks and Its Applications to Branch-and-Cut,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93274,"Hongyu Cheng, Sammy Khalife, Barbara Fiedorowicz, Amitabh Basu","Data-driven algorithm design is a paradigm that uses statistical and machine learning techniques to select from a class of algorithms for a computational problem an algorithm that has the best expected performance with respect to some (unknown) distribution on the instances of the problem. We build upon recent work in this line of research by considering the setup where, instead of selecting a single algorithm that has the best performance, we allow the possibility of selecting an algorithm based on the instance to be solved, using neural networks. In particular, given a representative sample of instances, we learn a neural network that maps an instance of the problem to the most appropriate algorithm *for that instance*. We formalize this idea and derive rigorous sample complexity bounds for this learning problem, in the spirit of recent work in data-driven algorithm design. We then apply this approach to the problem of making good decisions in the branch-and-cut framework for mixed-integer optimization (e.g., which cut to add?). In other words, the neural network will take as input a mixed-integer optimization instance and output a decision that will result in a small branch-and-cut tree for that instance. Our computational results provide evidence that our particular way of using neural networks for cut selection can make a significant impact in reducing branch-and-cut tree sizes, compared to previous data-driven approaches."
