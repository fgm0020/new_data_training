Poster,Active learning of neural population dynamics using two-photon holographic optogenetics,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93697,"Andrew Wagenmaker, Lu Mi, Marton Rozsa, Matthew Bull, Karel Svoboda, Kayvon Daie, Matthew Golub, Kevin Jamieson","Recent advances in techniques for monitoring and perturbing neural populations have greatly enhanced our ability to study circuits in the brain.  In particular, two-photon holographic optogenetics now enables precise photostimulation of experimenter-specified groups of individual neurons, while simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging enables the measurement of ongoing and induced activity across the neural population. Despite the enormous space of potential photostimulation patterns and the time-consuming nature of photostimulation experiments, very little algorithmic work has been done to determine the most effective photostimulation patterns for identifying the neural population dynamics. Here, we develop methods to efficiently select which neurons to stimulate such that the resulting neural responses will best inform a dynamical model of the neural population activity. Using neural population responses to photostimulation in mouse motor cortex, we demonstrate the efficacy of a low-rank linear dynamical systems model, and develop an active learning procedure which takes advantage of low-rank structure to determine informative photostimulation patterns. We demonstrate our approach on both real and synthetic data, obtaining in some cases as much as a two-fold reduction in the amount of data required to reach a given predictive power. Our active stimulation design method is based on a novel active learning procedure for low-rank regression, which may be of independent interest."
Poster,Active Learning with LLMs for Partially Observed and Cost-Aware Scenarios,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94473,"Nicolás Astorga, Tennison Liu, Nabeel Seedat, Mihaela van der Schaar","Conducting experiments and gathering data for machine learning models is a complex and expensive endeavor, particularly when confronted with limited information. Typically, extensive _experiments_ to obtain features and labels come with a significant acquisition cost, making it impractical to carry out all of them. Therefore, it becomes crucial to strategically determine what to acquire to maximize the predictive performance while minimizing costs. To perform this task, existing data acquisition methods assume the availability of an initial dataset that is both fully-observed and labeled, crucially overlooking the **partial observability** of features characteristic of many real-world scenarios. In response to this challenge, we present Partially Observable Cost-Aware Active-Learning (POCA), a new learning approach aimed at improving model generalization in data-scarce and data-costly scenarios through label and/or feature acquisition. Introducing $\mu$POCA as an instantiation, we maximise the uncertainty reduction in the predictive model when obtaining labels and features, considering associated costs. $\mu$POCA enhance traditional Active Learning metrics based solely on the observed features by generating the unobserved features through Generative Surrogate Models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). We empirically validate $\mu$POCA across diverse tabular datasets, varying data availability, acquisition costs, and LLMs."
Poster,Active Perception for Grasp Detection via Neural Graspness Field,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96537,"Haoxiang Ma, Modi Shi, Boyang Gao, Di Huang","This paper tackles the challenge of active perception for robotic grasp detection in cluttered environments. Incomplete 3D geometry information can negatively affect the performance of learning-based grasp detection methods, and scanning the scene from multiple views introduces significant time costs. To achieve reliable grasping performance with efficient camera movement, we propose an active grasp detection framework based on the Neural Graspness Field (NGF), which models the scene incrementally and facilitates next-best-view planning. Constructed in real-time as the camera moves, the NGF effectively models the grasp distribution in 3D space by rendering graspness predictions from each view. For next-best-view planning, we aim to reduce the uncertainty of the NGF through a graspness inconsistency-guided policy, selecting views based on discrepancies between NGF outputs and a pre-trained graspness network. Additionally, we present a neural graspness sampling method that decodes graspness values from the NGF to improve grasp pose detection results. Extensive experiments on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to previous works. Real-world experiments show that our method achieves a superior trade-off between grasping performance and time costs."
Poster,Active preference learning for ordering items in- and out-of-sample,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95312,"Herman Bergström, Emil Carlsson, Devdatt Dubhashi, Fredrik Johansson","Learning an ordering of items based on pairwise comparisons is useful when items are difficult to rate consistently on an absolute scale, for example, when annotators have to make subjective assessments. When exhaustive comparison is infeasible, actively sampling item pairs can reduce the number of annotations necessary for learning an accurate ordering. However, many algorithms ignore shared structure between items, limiting their sample efficiency and precluding generalization to new items. It is also common to disregard how noise in comparisons varies between item pairs, despite it being informative of item similarity. In this work, we study active preference learning for ordering items with contextual attributes, both in- and out-of-sample. We give an upper bound on the expected ordering error of a logistic preference model as a function of which items have been compared. Next, we propose an active learning strategy that samples items to minimize this bound by accounting for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in comparisons. We evaluate the resulting algorithm, and a variant aimed at reducing model misspecification, in multiple realistic ordering tasks with comparisons made by human annotators. Our results demonstrate superior sample efficiency and generalization compared to non-contextual ranking approaches and active preference learning baselines."
Poster,Active Sequential Posterior Estimation for Sample-Efficient Simulation-Based Inference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94187,"Sam Griesemer, Defu Cao, Zijun Cui, Carolina Osorio, Yan Liu","Computer simulations have long presented the exciting possibility of scientific insight into complex real-world processes. Despite the power of modern computing, however, it remains challenging to systematically perform inference under simulation models. This has led to the rise of simulation-based inference (SBI), a class of machine learning-enabled techniques for approaching inverse problems with stochastic simulators. Many such methods, however, require large numbers of simulation samples and face difficulty scaling to high-dimensional settings, often making inference prohibitive under resource-intensive simulators. To mitigate these drawbacks, we introduce active sequential neural posterior estimation (ASNPE). ASNPE brings an active learning scheme into the inference loop to estimate the utility of simulation parameter candidates to the underlying probabilistic model. The proposed acquisition scheme is easily integrated into existing posterior estimation pipelines, allowing for improved sample efficiency with low computational overhead. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the travel demand calibration setting, a high-dimensional inverse problem commonly requiring computationally expensive traffic simulators. Our method outperforms well-tuned benchmarks and state-of-the-art posterior estimation methods on a large-scale real-world traffic network, as well as demonstrates a performance advantage over non-active counterparts on a suite of SBI benchmark environments."
Poster,Active Set Ordering,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95884,"Quoc Phong Nguyen, Sunil Gupta, Svetha Venkatesh, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low, Patrick Jaillet","In this paper, we formalize the active set ordering problem, which involves actively discovering a set of inputs based on their orderings determined by expensive evaluations of a blackbox function. We then propose the mean prediction (MP) algorithm and theoretically analyze it  in terms of the regret of predicted pairwise orderings between inputs. Notably, as a special case of this framework, we can cast Bayesian optimization as an active set ordering problem by recognizing that maximizers can be identified solely by comparison rather than by precisely estimating the function evaluations. As a result, we are able to construct the popular Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) algorithm through the lens of ordering with several nuanced insights. We empirically validate the performance of our proposed solution using various synthetic functions and real-world datasets."
Poster,ActSort: An active-learning accelerated cell sorting algorithm for large-scale calcium imaging datasets,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96648,"Yiqi Jiang, Hakki Akengin, Ji Zhou, Mehmet Aslihak, Yang Li, Radoslaw Chrapkiewicz, Oscar Hernandez, sadegh ebrahimi, Omar Jaidar, Yanping Zhang, Hakan Inan, Christopher Miranda, Fatih Dinc, Marta Pozo, Mark Schnitzer","Recent advances in calcium imaging enable simultaneous recordings of up to a million neurons in behaving animals, producing datasets of unprecedented scales. Although individual neurons and their activity traces can be extracted from these videos with automated algorithms, the results often require human curation to remove false positives, a laborious process called \emph{cell sorting}. To address this challenge, we introduce ActSort, an active-learning algorithm for sorting large-scale datasets that integrates features engineered by domain experts together with data formats with minimal memory requirements. By strategically bringing outlier cell candidates near the decision boundary up for annotation, ActSort reduces human labor to about 1–3\% of cell candidates and improves curation accuracy by mitigating annotator bias. To facilitate the algorithm's widespread adoption among experimental neuroscientists, we created a user-friendly software and conducted a first-of-its-kind benchmarking study involving about 160,000 annotations.  Our tests validated ActSort's performance across different experimental conditions and datasets from multiple animals.  Overall, ActSort addresses a crucial bottleneck in processing large-scale calcium videos of neural activity and thereby facilitates systems neuroscience experiments at previously inaccessible scales.

Poster,AdaFlow: Imitation Learning with Variance-Adaptive Flow-Based Policies,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93256,"Xixi Hu, Qiang Liu, Xingchao Liu, Bo Liu","Diffusion-based imitation learning improves Behavioral Cloning (BC) on multi-modal decision-making, but comes at the cost of significantly slower inference due to the recursion in the diffusion process. It urges us to design efficient policy generators while keeping the ability to generate diverse actions. To address this challenge, we propose AdaFlow, an imitation learning framework based on flow-based generative modeling. AdaFlow represents the policy with state-conditioned ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which are known as probability flows. We reveal an intriguing connection between the conditional variance of their training loss and the discretization error of the ODEs.With this insight, we propose a variance-adaptive ODE solver that can adjust its step size in the inference stage, makingAdaFlow an adaptive decision-maker, offering rapid inference without sacrificing diversity. Interestingly, it automatically reduces to a one-step generator when the action distribution is uni-modal. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation shows that AdaFlow achieves high performance with fast inference speed."
Poster,Adam on Local Time: Addressing Nonstationarity in RL with Relative Adam Timesteps,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94469,"Benjamin Ellis, Matthew T Jackson, Andrei Lupu, Alexander D. Goldie, Mattie Fellows, Shimon Whiteson, Jakob Foerster","In reinforcement learning (RL), it is common to apply techniques used broadly in machine learning such as neural network function approximators and momentum-based optimizers. However, such tools were largely developed for supervised learning rather than nonstationary RL, leading practitioners to adopt target networks, clipped policy updates, and other RL-specific implementation tricks to combat this mismatch, rather than directly adapting this toolchain for use in RL. In this paper, we take a different approach and instead address the effect of nonstationarity by adapting the widely used Adam optimiser. We first analyse the impact of nonstationary gradient magnitude --- such as that caused by a change in target network --- on Adam's update size, demonstrating that such a change can lead to large updates and hence sub-optimal performance.To address this, we introduce Adam-Rel.Rather than using the global timestep in the Adam update, Adam-Rel uses the *local* timestep within an epoch, essentially resetting Adam's timestep to 0 after target changes.We demonstrate that this avoids large updates and reduces to learning rate annealing in the absence of such increases in gradient magnitude. Evaluating Adam-Rel in both on-policy and off-policy RL, we demonstrate improved performance in both Atari and Craftax.We then show that increases in gradient norm occur in RL in practice, and examine the differences between our theoretical model and the observed data."
Poster,Ada-MSHyper: Adaptive Multi-Scale Hypergraph Transformer for Time Series Forecasting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95175,"Zongjiang Shang, Ling Chen, Binqing Wu, Dongliang Cui","Although transformer-based methods have achieved great success in multi-scale temporal pattern interaction modeling, two key challenges limit their further development: (1) Individual time points contain less semantic information, and leveraging attention to model pair-wise interactions may cause the information utilization bottleneck. (2) Multiple inherent temporal variations (e.g., rising, falling, and fluctuating) entangled in temporal patterns. To this end, we propose Adaptive Multi-Scale Hypergraph Transformer (Ada-MSHyper) for time series forecasting. Specifically, an adaptive hypergraph learning module is designed to provide foundations for modeling group-wise interactions, then a multi-scale interaction module is introduced to promote more comprehensive pattern interactions at different scales. In addition, a node and hyperedge constraint mechanism is introduced to cluster nodes with similar semantic information and differentiate the temporal variations within each scales. Extensive experiments on 11 real-world datasets demonstrate that Ada-MSHyper achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing prediction errors by an average of 4.56%, 10.38%, and 4.97% in MSE for long-range, short-range, and ultra-long-range time series forecasting, respectively.
