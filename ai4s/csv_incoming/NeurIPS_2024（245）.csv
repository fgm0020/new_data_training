Poster,MambaTree: Tree Topology is All You Need in State Space Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94853,"Yicheng Xiao, Lin Song, shaoli huang, Jiangshan Wang, Siyu Song, Yixiao Ge, Xiu Li, Ying Shan","The state space models, employing recursively propagated features, demonstrate strong representation capabilities comparable to Transformer models and superior efficiency.However, constrained by the inherent geometric constraints of sequences, it still falls short in modeling long-range dependencies.To address this issue, we propose the MambaTree network, which first dynamically generates a tree topology based on spatial relationships and input features.Then, feature propagation is performed based on this graph, thereby breaking the original sequence constraints to achieve stronger representation capabilities.Additionally, we introduce a linear complexity dynamic programming algorithm to enhance long-range interactions without increasing computational cost.MambaTree is a versatile multimodal framework that can be applied to both visual and textual tasks.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing structured state space models on image classification, object detection and segmentation.Besides, by fine-tuning large language models, our approach achieves consistent improvements in multiple textual tasks at minor training cost."
Poster,MAmmoTH2: Scaling Instructions from the Web,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93014,"Xiang Yue, Tianyu Zheng, Ge Zhang, Wenhu Chen","Instruction tuning improves the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), with data quality and scalability being the crucial factors. Most instruction tuning data come from human crowd-sourcing or GPT-4 distillation. We propose a paradigm to efficiently harvest 10 million naturally existing instruction data from the pre-training web corpus to enhance LLM reasoning. Our approach involves (1) recalling relevant documents, (2) extracting instruction-response pairs, and (3) refining the extracted pairs using open-source LLMs. Fine-tuning base LLMs on this dataset, we build MAmmoTH2 models, which significantly boost performance on reasoning benchmarks. Notably, MAmmoTH2-7B’s (Mistral) performance increases from 11% to 36.7% on MATH and from 36% to 68.4% on GSM8K without training on any in-domain data. Further training MAmmoTH2 on public instruction tuning datasets yields MAmmoTH2-Plus, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several reasoning and chatbot benchmarks. Our work demonstrates how to harvest large-scale, high-quality instruction data without costly human annotation or GPT-4 distillation, providing a new paradigm for building better instruction tuning data."
Poster,ManiPose: Manifold-Constrained Multi-Hypothesis 3D Human Pose Estimation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93050,"Cédric ROMMEL, Victor Letzelter, Nermin Samet, Renaud Marlet, Matthieu Cord, Patrick Perez, Eduardo Valle","We propose ManiPose, a manifold-constrained multi-hypothesis model for human-pose 2D-to-3D lifting. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that, due to the depth ambiguity inherent to monocular 3D human pose estimation, traditional regression models suffer from pose-topology consistency issues, which standard evaluation metrics (MPJPE, P-MPJPE and PCK) fail to assess.  ManiPose addresses depth ambiguity by proposing multiple candidate 3D poses for each 2D input, each with its estimated plausibility. Unlike previous multi-hypothesis approaches, ManiPose forgoes generative models, greatly facilitating its training and usage. By constraining the outputs to lie on the human pose manifold, ManiPose guarantees the consistency of all hypothetical poses, in contrast to previous works. We showcase the performance of ManiPose on real-world datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art models in pose consistency by a large margin while being very competitive on the MPJPE metric."
Poster,MaNo: Exploiting Matrix Norm for Unsupervised Accuracy Estimation Under Distribution Shifts,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93765,"RENCHUNZI XIE, Ambroise Odonnat, Vasilii Feofanov, Weijian Deng, Jianfeng Zhang, Bo An","Leveraging the model’s outputs, specifically the logits, is a common approach to estimating the test accuracy of a pre-trained neural network on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples without requiring access to the corresponding ground-truth labels.Despite their ease of implementation and computational efficiency, current logit-based methods are vulnerable to overconfidence issues, leading to prediction bias, especially under the natural shift. In this work, we first study the relationship between logits and generalization performance from the view of low-density separation assumption. Our findings motivate our proposed method \method{} that \textbf{(1)}~applies a data-dependent normalization on the logits to reduce prediction bias, and \textbf{(2)} takes the $L_p$ norm of the matrix of normalized logits as the estimation score. Our theoretical analysis highlights the connection between the provided score and the model's uncertainty. We conduct an extensive empirical study on common unsupervised accuracy estimation benchmarks and demonstrate that \method{} achieves state-of-the-art performance across various architectures in the presence of synthetic, natural, or subpopulation shifts.

Poster,MAN TruckScenes: A multimodal dataset for autonomous trucking in diverse conditions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97650,"Felix Fent, Fabian Kuttenreich, Florian Ruch, Farija Rizwin, Stefan Juergens, Lorenz Lechermann, Christian Nissler, Andrea Perl, Ulrich Voll, Min Yan, Markus Lienkamp","Autonomous trucking is a promising technology that can greatly impact modern logistics and the environment. Ensuring its safety on public roads is one of the main duties that requires an accurate perception of the environment. To achieve this, machine learning methods rely on large datasets, but to this day, no such datasets are available for autonomous trucks. In this work, we present MAN TruckScenes, the first multimodal dataset for autonomous trucking. MAN TruckScenes allows the research community to come into contact with truck-specific challenges, such as trailer occlusions, novel sensor perspectives, and terminal environments for the first time. It comprises more than 740 scenes of 20 s each within a multitude of different environmental conditions. The sensor set includes 4 cameras, 6 lidar, 6 radar sensors, 2 IMUs, and a high-precision GNSS. The dataset's 3D bounding boxes were manually annotated and carefully reviewed to achieve a high quality standard. Bounding boxes are available for 27 object classes, 15 attributes, and a range of more than 230 m. The scenes are tagged according to 34 distinct scene tags, and all objects are tracked throughout the scene to promote a wide range of applications. Additionally, MAN TruckScenes is the first dataset to provide 4D radar data with 360° coverage and is thereby the largest radar dataset with annotated 3D bounding boxes. Finally, we provide extensive dataset analysis and baseline results. The dataset, development kit, and more will be available online."
Poster,Many-Shot In-Context Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96277,"Rishabh Agarwal, Avi Singh, Lei Zhang, Bernd Bohnet, Luis Rosias, Stephanie Chan, Biao Zhang, Ankesh Anand, Zaheer Abbas, Azade Nova, John Co-Reyes, Eric Chu, Feryal Behbahani, Aleksandra Faust, Hugo Larochelle","Large language models (LLMs) excel at few-shot in-context learning (ICL) -- learning from a few examples provided in context at inference, without any weight updates. Newly expanded context windows allow us to investigate ICL with hundreds or thousands of examples – the many-shot regime. Going from few-shot to many-shot, we observe significant performance gains across a wide variety of generative and discriminative tasks. While promising, many-shot ICL can be bottlenecked by the available amount of human-generated outputs. To mitigate this limitation, we explore two new settings: (1) ""Reinforced ICL"" that uses model-generated chain-of-thought rationales in place of human rationales, and (2) ""Unsupervised ICL"" where we remove rationales from the prompt altogether, and prompts the model only with domain-specific inputs. We find that both Reinforced and Unsupervised ICL can be quite effective in the many-shot regime, particularly on complex reasoning tasks. We demonstrate that, unlike few-shot learning, many-shot learning is effective at overriding pretraining biases, can learn high-dimensional functions with numerical inputs, and performs comparably to supervised fine-tuning. Finally, we reveal the limitations of next-token prediction loss as an indicator of downstream ICL performance."
Poster,Many-shot Jailbreaking,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94370,"Cem Anil, Esin DURMUS, Nina Panickssery, Mrinank Sharma, Joe Benton, Sandipan Kundu, Joshua Batson, Meg Tong, Jesse Mu, Daniel Ford, Francesco Mosconi, Rajashree Agrawal, Rylan Schaeffer, Naomi Bashkansky, Samuel Svenningsen, Mike Lambert, Ansh Radhakrishnan, Carson Denison, Evan Hubinger, Yuntao Bai, Trenton Bricken, Timothy Maxwell, Nicholas Schiefer, James Sully, Alex Tamkin, Tamera Lanham, Karina Nguyen, Tomek Korbak, Jared Kaplan, Deep Ganguli, Samuel Bowman, Ethan Perez, Roger Grosse, David Duvenaud","We investigate a family of simple long-context attacks on large language models: prompting with hundreds of demonstrations of undesirable behavior. This attack is newly feasible with the larger context windows recently deployed by language model providers like Google DeepMind, OpenAI and Anthropic. We find that in diverse, realistic circumstances, the effectiveness of this attack follows a power law, up to hundreds of shots. We demonstrate the success of this attack on the most widely used state-of-the-art closed-weight models, and across various tasks. Our results suggest very long contexts present a rich new attack surface for LLMs."
Poster,Map It Anywhere: Empowering BEV Map Prediction using Large-scale Public Datasets,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97549,"Cherie Ho, Jiaye Zou, Omar Alama, Sai Mitheran Jagadesh Kumar, Cheng-Yu Chiang, Taneesh Gupta, Chen Wang, Nikhil Keetha, Katia Sycara, Sebastian Scherer","Top-down Bird's Eye View (BEV) maps are a popular perception representation for ground robot navigation due to their richness and flexibility for downstream tasks. While recent methods have shown promise for predicting BEV maps from First-Person View (FPV) images, their generalizability is limited to small regions captured by current autonomous vehicle-based datasets. In this context, we show that a more scalable approach towards generalizable map prediction can be enabled by using two large-scale crowd-sourced mapping platforms, Mapillary for FPV images and OpenStreetMap for BEV semantic maps.We introduce Map It Anywhere (MIA), a data engine that enables seamless curation and modeling of labeled map prediction data from existing open-source map platforms. Using our MIA data engine, we display the ease of automatically collecting a 1.2 million FPV & BEV pair dataset encompassing diverse geographies, landscapes, environmental factors, camera models & capture scenarios. We further train a simple camera model-agnostic model on this data for BEV map prediction.Extensive evaluations using established benchmarks and our dataset show that the data curated by MIA enables effective pretraining for generalizable BEV map prediction, with zero-shot performance far exceeding baselines trained on existing datasets by 35%. Our analysis highlights the promise of using large-scale public maps for developing & testing generalizable BEV perception, paving the way for more robust autonomous navigation.Website: mapitanywhere.github.io"
Poster,Marginal Causal Flows for Validation and Inference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92962,"Daniel de Vassimon Manela, Laura Battaglia, Robin Evans","Investigating the marginal causal effect of an intervention on an outcome from complex data remains challenging due to the inflexibility of employed models and the lack of complexity in causal benchmark datasets, which often fail to reproduce intricate real-world data patterns. In this paper we introduce Frugal Flows, a likelihood-based machine learning model that uses normalising flows to flexibly learn the data-generating process, while also directly targeting the marginal causal quantities inferred from observational data. We provide a novel algorithm for fitting a model to observational data with a parametrically specified causal distribution, and propose that these models are exceptionally well suited for synthetic data generation to validate causal methods. Unlike existing data generation methods, Frugal Flows generate synthetic data that closely resembles the empirical dataset, while also automatically and exactly satisfying a user-defined average treatment effect. To our knowledge, Frugal Flows are the first generative model to both learn flexible data representations and also \textit{exactly} parameterise quantities such as the average treatment effect and the degree of unobserved confounding. We demonstrate the above with experiments on  both simulated and real-world datasets."
Poster,Markov Equivalence and Consistency in Differentiable Structure Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95039,"Chang Deng, Kevin Bello, Pradeep Ravikumar, Bryon Aragam","Existing approaches to differentiable structure learning of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) rely on strong identifiability assumptions in order to guarantee that global minimizers of the acyclicity-constrained optimization problem identifies the true DAG. Moreover, it has been observed empirically that the optimizer may exploit undesirable artifacts in the loss function. We explain and remedy these issues by studying the behavior of differentiable acyclicity-constrained programs under general likelihoods with multiple global minimizers. By carefully regularizing the likelihood, it is possible to identify the sparsest model in the Markov equivalence class, even in the absence of an identifiable parametrization. We first study the Gaussian case in detail, showing how proper regularization of the likelihood defines a score that identifies the sparsest model. Assuming faithfulness, it also recovers the Markov equivalence class. These results are then generalized to general models and likelihoods, where the same claims hold. These theoretical results are validated empirically, showing how this can be done using standard gradient-based optimizers (without resorting to approximations such as Gumbel-Softmax), thus paving the way for differentiable structure learning under general models and losses.
