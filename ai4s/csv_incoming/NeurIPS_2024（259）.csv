Poster,MMScan: A Multi-Modal 3D Scene Dataset with Hierarchical Grounded Language Annotations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97429,"Ruiyuan Lyu, Jingli Lin, Tai WANG, Shuaiyang, Xiaohan Mao, Yilun Chen, Runsen Xu, Haifeng Huang, Chenming Zhu, Dahua Lin, Jiangmiao Pang","With the emergence of LLMs and their integration with other data modalities, multi-modal 3D perception attracts more attention due to its connectivity to the physical world and makes rapid progress. However, limited by existing datasets, previous works mainly focus on understanding object properties or inter-object spatial relationships in a 3D scene. To tackle this problem, this paper builds the first largest ever multi-modal 3D scene dataset and benchmark with hierarchical grounded language annotations, MMScan. It is constructed based on a top-down logic, from region to object level, from a single target to inter-target relationships, covering holistic aspects of spatial and attribute understanding. The overall pipeline incorporates powerful VLMs via carefully designed prompts to initialize the annotations efficiently and further involve humans' correction in the loop to ensure the annotations are natural, correct, and comprehensive. Built upon existing 3D scanning data, the resulting multi-modal 3D dataset encompasses 1.4M meta-annotated captions on 109k objects and 7.7k regions as well as over 3.04M diverse samples for 3D visual grounding and question-answering benchmarks. We evaluate representative baselines on our benchmarks, analyze their capabilities in different aspects, and showcase the key problems to be addressed in the future. Furthermore, we use this high-quality dataset to train state-of-the-art 3D visual grounding and LLMs and obtain remarkable performance improvement both on existing benchmarks and in-the-wild evaluation."
Poster,MMSite: A Multi-modal Framework for the Identification of Active Sites in Proteins,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94780,"Song Ouyang, Huiyu Cai, Yong Luo, Kehua Su, Lefei Zhang, Bo Du","The accurate identification of active sites in proteins is essential for the advancement of life sciences and pharmaceutical development, as these sites are of critical importance for enzyme activity and drug design. Recent advancements in protein language models (PLMs), trained on extensive datasets of amino acid sequences, have significantly improved our understanding of proteins. However, compared to the abundant protein sequence data, functional annotations, especially precise per-residue annotations, are scarce, which limits the performance of PLMs. On the other hand, textual descriptions of proteins, which could be annotated by human experts or a pretrained protein sequence-to-text model, provide meaningful context that could assist in the functional annotations, such as the localization of active sites. This motivates us to construct a $\textbf{ProT}$ein-$\textbf{A}$ttribute text $\textbf{D}$ataset ($\textbf{ProTAD}$), comprising over 570,000 pairs of protein sequences and multi-attribute textual descriptions. Based on this dataset, we propose $\textbf{MMSite}$, a multi-modal framework that improves the performance of PLMs to identify active sites by leveraging biomedical language models (BLMs). In particular, we incorporate manual prompting and design a MACross module to deal with the multi-attribute characteristics of textual descriptions. MMSite is a two-stage (""First Align, Then Fuse"") framework: first aligns the textual modality with the sequential modality through soft-label alignment, and then identifies active sites via multi-modal fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MMSite achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing protein representation learning methods. The dataset and code implementation are available at https://github.com/Gift-OYS/MMSite."
Poster,MM-WLAuslan: Multi-View Multi-Modal Word-Level Australian Sign Language Recognition Dataset,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97466,"Xin Shen, Heming Du, Hongwei Sheng, Shuyun Wang, Hui Chen, Huiqiang Chen, Zhuojie Wu, Xiaobiao Du, Jiaying Ying, Ruihan Lu, Qingzheng Xu, Xin Yu","Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) focuses on identifying individual sign language glosses. Considering the diversity of sign languages across geographical regions, developing region-specific ISLR datasets is crucial for supporting communication and research. Auslan, as a sign language specific to Australia, still lacks a dedicated large-scale word-level dataset for the ISLR task. To fill this gap, we curate \underline{\textbf{the first}} large-scale Multi-view Multi-modal Word-Level Australian Sign Language recognition dataset, dubbed MM-WLAuslan. Compared to other publicly available datasets, MM-WLAuslan exhibits three significant advantages: (1) **the largest amount** of data, (2) **the most extensive** vocabulary, and (3) **the most diverse** of multi-modal camera views. Specifically, we record **282K+** sign videos covering **3,215** commonly used Auslan glosses presented by **73** signers in a studio environment.Moreover, our filming system includes two different types of cameras, i.e., three Kinect-V2 cameras and a RealSense camera. We position cameras hemispherically around the front half of the model and simultaneously record videos using all four cameras. Furthermore, we benchmark results with state-of-the-art methods for various multi-modal ISLR settings on MM-WLAuslan, including multi-view, cross-camera, and cross-view. Experiment results indicate that MM-WLAuslan is a challenging ISLR dataset, and we hope this dataset will contribute to the development of Auslan and the advancement of sign languages worldwide. All datasets and benchmarks are available at MM-WLAuslan."
Poster,Mobile-Agent-v2: Mobile Device Operation Assistant with Effective Navigation via Multi-Agent Collaboration,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95398,"Junyang Wang, Haiyang Xu, Haitao Jia, Xi Zhang, Ming Yan, Weizhou Shen, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang, Jitao Sang","Mobile device operation tasks are increasingly becoming a popular multi-modal AI application scenario. Current Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), constrained by their training data, lack the capability to function effectively as operation assistants. Instead, MLLM-based agents, which enhance capabilities through tool invocation, are gradually being applied to this scenario. However, the two major navigation challenges in mobile device operation tasks — task progress navigation and focus content navigation — are difficult to effectively solve under the single-agent architecture of existing work. This is due to the overly long token sequences and the interleaved text-image data format, which limit performance. To address these navigation challenges effectively, we propose Mobile-Agent-v2, a multi-agent architecture for mobile device operation assistance. The architecture comprises three agents: planning agent, decision agent, and reflection agent. The planning agent condenses lengthy, interleaved image-text history operations and screens summaries into a pure-text task progress, which is then passed on to the decision agent. This reduction in context length makes it easier for decision agent to navigate the task progress. To retain focus content, we design a memory unit that updates with task progress by decision agent. Additionally, to correct erroneous operations, the reflection agent observes the outcomes of each operation and handles any mistake accordingly. Experimental results indicate that Mobile-Agent-v2 achieves over a 30% improvement in task completion compared to the single-agent architecture of Mobile-Agent. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent."
Poster,Mobility-LLM: Learning Visiting Intentions and Travel Preference from Human Mobility Data with Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96914,"Letian Gong, Yan Lin, zxy, Yiwen Lu, Xuedi Han, Yichen Liu, Shengnan Guo, Youfang Lin, Huaiyu Wan","Location-based services (LBS) have accumulated extensive human mobility data on diverse behaviors through check-in sequences. These sequences offer valuable insights into users’ intentions and preferences. Yet, existing models analyzing check-in sequences fail to consider the semantics contained in these sequences, which closely reflect human visiting intentions and travel preferences, leading to an incomplete comprehension. Drawing inspiration from the exceptional semantic understanding and contextual information processing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across various domains, we present Mobility-LLM, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze check-in sequences for multiple tasks. Since LLMs cannot directly interpret check-ins, we reprogram these sequences to help LLMs comprehensively understand the semantics of human visiting intentions and travel preferences. Specifically, we introduce a visiting intention memory network (VIMN) to capture the visiting intentions at each record, along with a shared pool of human travel preference prompts (HTPP) to guide the LLM in understanding users’ travel preferences. These components enhance the model’s ability to extract and leverage semantic information from human mobility data effectively. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets and three downstream tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing models, underscoring the effectiveness of Mobility-LLM in advancing our understanding of human mobility data within LBS contexts."
Poster,MO-DDN: A Coarse-to-Fine Attribute-based Exploration Agent for Multi-Object Demand-driven Navigation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95471,"Hongcheng Wang, Peiqi Liu, Wenzhe Cai, Mingdong Wu, Zhengyu Qian, Hao Dong","The process of satisfying daily demands is a fundamental aspect of humans' daily lives. With the advancement of embodied AI, robots are increasingly capable of satisfying human demands. Demand-driven navigation (DDN) is a task in which an agent must locate an object to satisfy a specified demand instruction, such as ""I am thirsty."" The previous study typically assumes that each demand instruction requires only one object to be fulfilled and does not consider individual preferences. However, the realistic human demand may involve multiple objects. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-object Demand-driven Navigation (MO-DDN) benchmark, which addresses these nuanced aspects, including multi-object search and personal preferences, thus making the MO-DDN task more reflective of real-life scenarios compared to DDN. Building upon previous work, we employ the concept of ``attribute'' to tackle this new task. However, instead of solely relying on attribute features in an end-to-end manner like DDN, we propose a modular method that involves constructing a coarse-to-fine attribute-based exploration agent (C2FAgent). Our experimental results illustrate that this coarse-to-fine exploration strategy capitalizes on the advantages of attributes at various decision-making levels, resulting in superior performance compared to baseline methods.

Poster,Model-based Diffusion for Trajectory Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96200,"Chaoyi Pan, Zeji Yi, Guanya Shi, Guannan Qu","Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated their strong capabilities in generating high-fidelity samples from complex distributions through an iterative refinement process. Despite the empirical success of diffusion models in motion planning and control, the model-free nature of these methods does not leverage readily available model information and limits their generalization to new scenarios beyond the training data (e.g., new robots with different dynamics). In this work, we introduce Model-Based Diffusion (MBD), an optimization approach using the diffusion process to solve trajectory optimization (TO) problems without data. The key idea is to explicitly compute the score function by leveraging the model information in TO problems, which is why we refer to our approach as model-based diffusion. Moreover, although MBD does not require external data, it can be naturally integrated with data of diverse qualities to steer the diffusion process. We also reveal that MBD has interesting connections to sampling-based optimization. Empirical evaluations show that MBD outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and sampling-based TO methods in challenging contact-rich tasks. Additionally, MBD’s ability to integrate with data enhances its versatility and practical applicability, even with imperfect and infeasible data (e.g., partial-state demonstrations for high-dimensional humanoids), beyond the scope of standard diffusion models.

Poster,Model Based Inference of Synaptic Plasticity Rules,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93446,"Yash Mehta, Danil Tyulmankov, Adithya Rajagopalan, Glenn Turner, James Fitzgerald, Jan Funke","Inferring the synaptic plasticity rules that govern learning in the brain is a key challenge in neuroscience. We present a novel computational method to infer these rules from experimental data, applicable to both neural and behavioral data. Our approach approximates plasticity rules using a parameterized function, employing either truncated Taylor series for theoretical interpretability or multilayer perceptrons. These plasticity parameters are optimized via gradient descent over entire trajectories to align closely with observed neural activity or behavioral learning dynamics. This method can uncover complex rules that induce long nonlinear time dependencies, particularly involving factors like postsynaptic activity and current synaptic weights. We validate our approach through simulations, successfully recovering established rules such as Oja's, as well as more intricate plasticity rules with reward-modulated terms. We assess the robustness of our technique to noise and apply it to behavioral data from \textit{Drosophila} in a probabilistic reward-learning experiment. Notably, our findings reveal an active forgetting component in reward learning in flies, improving predictive accuracy over previous models. This modeling framework offers a promising new avenue for elucidating the computational principles of synaptic plasticity and learning in the brain."
Poster,Model-Based Transfer Learning for Contextual Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95669,"Jung-Hoon Cho, Vindula Jayawardana, Sirui Li, Cathy Wu","Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach to complex decision-making. However, one issue that limits its practical application is its brittleness, sometimes failing to train in the presence of small changes in the environment. Motivated by the success of zero-shot transfer—where pre-trained models perform well on related tasks—we consider the problem of selecting a good set of training tasks to maximize generalization performance across a range of tasks. Given the high cost of training, it is critical to select training tasks strategically, but not well understood how to do so. We hence introduce Model-Based Transfer Learning (MBTL), which layers on top of existing RL methods to effectively solve contextual RL problems. MBTL models the generalization performance in two parts: 1) the performance set point, modeled using Gaussian processes, and 2) performance loss (generalization gap), modeled as a linear function of contextual similarity. MBTL combines these two pieces of information within a Bayesian optimization (BO) framework to strategically select training tasks. We show theoretically that the method exhibits sublinear regret in the number of training tasks and discuss conditions to further tighten regret bounds. We experimentally validate our methods using urban traffic and standard continuous control benchmarks. The experimental results suggest that MBTL can achieve up to 43x improved sample efficiency compared with canonical independent training and multi-task training. Further experiments demonstrate the efficacy of BO and the insensitivity to the underlying RL algorithm and hyperparameters. This work lays the foundations for investigating explicit modeling of generalization, thereby enabling principled yet effective methods for contextual RL.

Poster,Model Collapse Demystified: The Case of Regression,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94468,"Elvis Dohmatob, Yunzhen Feng, Julia Kempe","The era of proliferation of large language and image generation models begs the question of what happens if models are trained on the synthesized outputs of other models. The phenomenon of ""model collapse"" refers to the situation whereby as a model is trained recursively on data generated from previous generations of itself over time, its performance degrades until the model eventually becomes completely useless, i.e. the model collapses. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon within the context of high-dimensional regression with Gaussian data, considering both low- and high-dimensional asymptotics. We derive analytical formulas that quantitatively describe this phenomenon in both under-parameterized and over-parameterized regimes. We show how test error increases linearly in the number of model iterations in terms of all problem hyperparameters (covariance spectrum, regularization, label noise level, dataset size) and further isolate how model collapse affects both bias and variance terms in our setup. We show that even in the noise-free case, catastrophic (exponentially fast) model-collapse can happen in the over-parametrized regime. In the special case of polynomial decaying spectral and source conditions, we obtain modified scaling laws which exhibit new crossover phenomena from fast to slow rates. We also propose a simple strategy based on adaptive regularization to mitigate model collapse. Our theoretical results are validated with experiments."
