Poster,Multi-hypotheses Conditioned Point Cloud Diffusion for 3D Human Reconstruction from Occluded Images,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96061,"Donghwan Kim, Tae-Kyun Kim","3D human shape reconstruction under severe occlusion due to human-object or human-human interaction is a challenging problem. While implicit function methods capture detailed clothed shapes, they require aligned shape priors and or are weak at inpainting occluded regions given an image input. Parametric models i.e. SMPL, instead offer whole body shapes, however, are often misaligned with images. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline composed of a probabilistic SMPL model and point cloud diffusion for pixel-aligned detailed 3D human reconstruction under occlusion. Multiple hypotheses generated by the probabilistic SMPL method are conditioned via continuous 3D shape representations. Point cloud diffusion refines the distribution of 3D points fitted to both the multi-hypothesis shape condition and pixel-aligned image features, offering detailed clothed shapes and inpainting occluded parts of human bodies. In the experiments using the CAPE, MultiHuman and Hi4D datasets, the proposed method outperforms various SOTA methods based on SMPL, implicit functions, point cloud diffusion, and their combined, under synthetic and real occlusions.

Poster,Multi-Instance Partial-Label Learning with Margin Adjustment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95410,"Wei Tang, Yin-Fang Yang, Zhaofei Wang, Weijia Zhang, Min-Ling Zhang","Multi-instance partial-label learning (MIPL) is an emerging learning framework where each training sample is represented as a multi-instance bag associated with a candidate label set. Existing MIPL algorithms often overlook the margins for attention scores and predicted probabilities, leading to suboptimal generalization performance. A critical issue with these algorithms is that the highest prediction probability of the classifier may appear on a non-candidate label. In this paper, we propose an algorithm named MIPLMA, i.e., Multi-Instance Partial-Label learning with Margin Adjustment, which adjusts the margins for attention scores and predicted probabilities. We introduce a margin-aware attention mechanism to dynamically adjust the margins for attention scores and propose a margin distributionloss to constrain the margins between the predicted probabilities on candidate and non-candidate label sets. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of MIPLMA over existing MIPL algorithms, as well as other well-established multi-instance learning algorithms and partial-label learning algorithms."
Poster,Multi-Label Learning with Stronger Consistency Guarantees,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92969,"Anqi Mao, Mehryar Mohri, Yutao Zhong","We present a detailed study of surrogate losses and algorithms for multi-label learning, supported by $H$-consistency bounds. We first show that, for the simplest form of multi-label loss (the popular Hamming loss), the well-known consistent binary relevance surrogate suffers from a sub-optimal dependency on the number of labels in terms of $H$-consistency bounds, when using smooth losses such as logistic losses. Furthermore, this loss function fails to account for label correlations. To address these drawbacks, we introduce a novel surrogate loss, *multi-label logistic loss*,  that accounts for label correlations and benefits from label-independent $H$-consistency bounds. We then broaden our analysis to cover a more extensive family of multi-label losses, including all common ones and a new extension defined based on linear-fractional functions with respect to the confusion matrix. We also extend our multi-label logistic losses to more comprehensive multi-label comp-sum losses, adapting comp-sum losses from standard classification to the multi-label learning. We prove that this family of surrogate losses benefits from $H$-consistency bounds, and thus Bayes-consistency, across any general multi-label loss. Our work thus proposes a unified surrogate loss framework benefiting from strong consistency guarantees for any multi-label loss, significantly expanding upon previous work which only established Bayes-consistency and for specific loss functions. Additionally, we adapt constrained losses from standard classification to multi-label constrained losses in a similar way, which also benefit from $H$-consistency bounds and thus Bayes-consistency for any multi-label loss. We further describe efficient gradient computation algorithms for minimizing the multi-label logistic loss."
Poster,Multi-Label Open Set Recognition,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93923,"Yibo Wang, Jun-Yi Hang, Min-Ling Zhang","In multi-label learning, each training instance is associated with multiple labels simultaneously. Traditional multi-label learning studies primarily focus on closed set scenario, i.e. the class label set of test data is identical to those used in training phase. Nevertheless, in numerous real-world scenarios, the environment is open and dynamic where unknown labels may emerge gradually during testing. In this paper, the problem of multi-label open set recognition (MLOSR) is investigated, which poses significant challenges in classifying and recognizing instances with unknown labels in multi-label setting. To enable open set multi-label prediction, a novel approach named SLAN is proposed by leveraging sub-labeling information enriched by structural information in the feature space. Accordingly, unknown labels are recognized by differentiating the sub-labeling information from holistic supervision. Experimental results on various datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in dealing with the MLOSR problem."
Poster,Multi-language Diversity Benefits Autoformalization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96799,"Albert Q. Jiang, Wenda Li, Mateja Jamnik","Autoformalization is the task of translating natural language materials into machine-verifiable formalisations. Progress in autoformalization research is hindered by the lack of a sizeable dataset consisting of informal-formal pairs expressing the same essence. Existing methods tend to circumvent this challenge by manually curating small corpora or using few-shot learning with large language models. But these methods suffer from data scarcity and formal language acquisition difficulty. In this work, we create mma, a large, flexible, multi-language, and multi-domain dataset of informal-formal pairs, by using a language model to translate in the reverse direction, that is, from formal mathematical statements into corresponding informal ones. Experiments show that language models fine-tuned on mma can produce up to $29-31$\% of statements acceptable with minimal corrections on the miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks, up from $0$\% with the base model. We demonstrate that fine-tuning on multi-language formal data results in more capable autoformalization models even on single-language tasks."
Poster,Multilinear Mixture of Experts: Scalable Expert Specialization through Factorization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94496,"James Oldfield, Markos Georgopoulos, Grigorios Chrysos, Christos Tzelepis, Yannis Panagakis, Mihalis Nicolaou, Jiankang Deng, Ioannis Patras","The Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm provides a powerful way to decompose dense layers into smaller, modular computations often more amenable to human interpretation, debugging, and editability. However, a major challenge lies in the computational cost of scaling the number of experts high enough to achieve fine-grained specialization. In this paper, we propose the Multilinear Mixture of Experts (μMoE) layer to address this, focusing on vision models. μMoE layers enable scalable expert specialization by performing an implicit computation on prohibitively large weight tensors entirely in factorized form. Consequently, μMoEs (1) avoid the restrictively high inference-time costs of dense MoEs, yet (2) do not inherit the training issues of the popular sparse MoEs' discrete (non-differentiable) expert routing. We present both qualitative and quantitative evidence that scaling μMoE layers when fine-tuning foundation models for vision tasks leads to more specialized experts at the class-level, further enabling manual bias correction in CelebA attribute classification. Finally, we show qualitative results demonstrating the expert specialism achieved when pre-training large GPT2 and MLP-Mixer models with parameter-matched μMoE blocks at every layer, maintaining comparable accuracy.

Poster,Multilingual Diversity Improves Vision-Language Representations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96862,"Thao Nguyen, Matthew Wallingford, Sebastin Santy, Wei-Chiu Ma, Sewoong Oh, Ludwig Schmidt, Pang Wei Koh, Ranjay Krishna","Massive web-crawled image-text datasets lay the foundation for recent progress in multimodal learning. These datasets are designed with the goal of training a model to do well on standard computer vision benchmarks, many of which, however, have been shown to be English-centric (e.g., ImageNet). Consequently, existing data curation techniques gravitate towards using predominantly English image-text pairs and discard many potentially useful non-English samples. Our work questions this practice. Multilingual data is inherently enriching not only because it provides a gateway to learn about culturally salient concepts, but also because it depicts common concepts differently from monolingual data. We thus conduct a systematic study to explore the performance benefits of using more samples of non-English origins with respect to English vision tasks. By translating all multilingual image-text pairs from a raw web crawl to English and re-filtering them, we increase the prevalence of (translated) multilingual data in the resulting training set. Pre-training on this dataset outperforms using English-only or English-dominated datasets on ImageNet, ImageNet distribution shifts, image-English-text retrieval and on average across 38 tasks from the DataComp benchmark. On a geographically diverse task like GeoDE, we also observe improvements across all regions, with the biggest gain coming from Africa. In addition, we quantitatively show that English and non-English data are significantly different in both image and (translated) text space. We hope that our findings motivate future work to be more intentional about including multicultural and multilingual data, not just when non-English or geographically diverse tasks are involved, but to enhance model capabilities at large."
Poster,"Multi-LLM Debate: Framework, Principals, and Interventions",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93363,"Andrew Estornell, Yang Liu","The flexible and generalized nature of large language models has allowed for their application in a wide array of language-based domains.Much like their human contemporaries, these models are capable of engaging in discussions and debates as a means of improving answer quality.We first take a theoretical approach to analyzing debate and provide a framework through which debate can be mathematically examined.Building on this framework, we provide several theoretical results for multi-agent debate.In particular, we demonstrate that similar model capabilities, or similar model responses, can result in static debate dynamics where the debate procedure simply converges to the majority opinion. When this majority opinion is the result of a common misconception (ingrained in the models through shared training data) debate is likely to converge to answers associated with that common misconception.Using insights from our theoretical results we then propose three interventions which improve the efficacy of debate. For each intervention, we provide theoretical results demonstrating how debate is improved.We also demonstrate that these interventions result in better performance on four common benchmark tasks."
Poster,Multimodal Large Language Models Make Text-to-Image Generative Models Align Better,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95768,"Xun Wu, Shaohan Huang, Guolong Wang, Jing Xiong, Furu Wei","Recent studies have demonstrated the exceptional potentials of leveraging human preference datasets to refine text-to-image generative models, enhancing the alignment between generated images and textual prompts. Despite these advances, current human preference datasets are either prohibitively expensive to construct or suffer from a lack of diversity in preference dimensions, resulting in limited applicability for instruction tuning in open-source text-to-image generative models and hinder further exploration. To address these challenges and promote the alignment of generative models through instruction tuning, we leverage multimodal large language models to create VisionPrefer, a high-quality and fine-grained preference dataset that captures multiple preference aspects. We aggregate feedback from AI annotators across four aspects: prompt-following, aesthetic, fidelity, and harmlessness to construct VisionPrefer. To validate the effectiveness of VisionPrefer, we train a reward model VP-Score over VisionPrefer to guide the training of text-to-image generative models and the preference prediction accuracy of VP-Score is comparable to human annotators. Furthermore, we use two reinforcement learning methods to supervised fine-tune generative models to evaluate the performance of VisionPrefer, and extensive experimental results demonstrate that VisionPrefer significantly improves text-image alignment in compositional image generation across diverse aspects, e.g., aesthetic, and generalizes better than previous human-preference metrics across various image distributions. Moreover, VisionPrefer indicates that the integration of AI-generated synthetic data as a supervisory signal is a promising avenue for achieving improved alignment with human preferences in vision generative models."
Poster,Multi-modal Situated Reasoning in 3D Scenes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97727,"Xiongkun Linghu, Jiangyong Huang, Xuesong Niu, Xiaojian (Shawn) Ma, Baoxiong Jia, Siyuan Huang","Situation awareness is essential for understanding and reasoning about 3D scenes in embodied AI agents. However, existing datasets and benchmarks for situated understanding suffer from severe limitations in data modality, scope, diversity, and scale. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-modal Situated Question Answering (MSQA), a large-scale multi-modal situated reasoning dataset, scalably collected leveraging 3D scene graphs and vision-language models (VLMs) across a diverse range of real-world 3D scenes. MSQA includes 251K situated questionanswering pairs across 9 distinct question categories, covering complex scenarios and object modalities within 3D scenes. We introduce a novel interleaved multimodal input setting in our benchmark to provide both texts, images, and point clouds for situation and question description, aiming to resolve ambiguity in describing situations with single-modality inputs (e.g., texts). Additionally, we devise the Multi-modal Next-step Navigation (MSNN) benchmark to evaluate models’ grounding of actions and transitions between situations. Comprehensive evaluations on reasoning and navigation tasks highlight the limitations of existing vision-language models and underscore the importance of handling multi-modal interleaved inputs and situation modeling. Experiments on data scaling and crossdomain transfer further demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging MSQA as a pre-training dataset for developing more powerful situated reasoning models, contributing to advancements in 3D scene understanding for embodied AI."
