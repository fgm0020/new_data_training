Poster,Spatio-Temporal Interactive Learning for Efficient Image Reconstruction of Spiking Cameras,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95131,"Bin Fan, Jiaoyang Yin, Yuchao Dai, Chao Xu, Tiejun Huang, Boxin Shi","The spiking camera is an emerging neuromorphic vision sensor that records high-speed motion scenes by asynchronously firing continuous binary spike streams. Prevailing image reconstruction methods, generating intermediate frames from these spike streams, often rely on complex step-by-step network architectures that overlook the intrinsic collaboration of spatio-temporal complementary information. In this paper, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal interactive reconstruction network to jointly perform inter-frame feature alignment and intra-frame feature filtering in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, it starts by extracting hierarchical features from a concise hybrid spike representation, then refines the motion fields and target frames scale-by-scale, ultimately obtaining a full-resolution output. Meanwhile, we introduce a symmetric interactive attention block and a multi-motion field estimation block to further enhance the interaction capability of the overall network. Experiments on synthetic and real-captured data show that our approach exhibits excellent performance while maintaining low model complexity."
Poster,Speaking Your Language: Spatial Relationships in Interpretable Emergent Communication,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93209,"Olaf Lipinski, Adam Sobey, Federico Cerutti, Timothy Norman","Effective communication requires the ability to refer to specific parts of an observation in relation to others. While emergent communication literature shows success in developing various language properties, no research has shown the emergence of such positional references. This paper demonstrates how agents can communicate about spatial relationships within their observations. The results indicate that agents can develop a language capable of expressing the relationships between parts of their observation, achieving over 90% accuracy when trained in a referential game which requires such communication. Using a collocation measure, we demonstrate how the agents create such references. This analysis suggests that agents use a mixture of non-compositional and compositional messages to convey spatial relationships. We also show that the emergent language is interpretable by humans. The translation accuracy is tested by communicating with the receiver agent, where the receiver achieves over 78% accuracy using parts of this lexicon, confirming that the interpretation of the emergent language was successful."
Poster,SpeAr: A Spectral Approach for Zero-Shot Node Classification,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94267,"Ting Guo, Da Wang, Jiye Liang, Kaihan Zhang, Jianchao Zeng","Zero-shot node classification is a vital task in the field of graph data processing, aiming to identify nodes of classes unseen during the training process. Prediction bias is one of the primary challenges in zero-shot node classification, referring to the model's propensity to misclassify nodes of unseen classes as seen classes. However, most methods introduce external knowledge to mitigate the bias, inadequately leveraging the inherent cluster information within the unlabeled nodes. To address this issue, we employ spectral analysis coupled with learnable class prototypes to discover the implicit cluster structures within the graph, providing a more comprehensive understanding of classes. In this paper, we propose a spectral approach for zero-shot node classification (SpeAr). Specifically, we establish an approximate relationship between minimizing the spectral contrastive loss and performing spectral decomposition on the graph, thereby enabling effective node characterization through loss minimization. Subsequently, the class prototypes are iteratively refined based on the learned node representations, initialized with the semantic vectors. Finally, extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the SpeAr, which can further alleviate the bias problem."
Poster,SPEAR: Exact Gradient Inversion of Batches in Federated Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93833,"Dimitar I. Dimitrov, Maximilian Baader, Mark Müller, Martin Vechev","Federated learning is a framework for collaborative machine learning where clients only share gradient updates and not their private data with a server. However, it was recently shown that gradient inversion attacks can reconstruct this data from the shared gradients. In the important honest-but-curious setting, existing attacks enable exact reconstruction only for batch size of $b=1$, with larger batches permitting only approximate reconstruction. In this work, we propose SPEAR, *the first algorithm reconstructing whole batches with $b >1$ exactly*. SPEAR combines insights into the explicit low-rank structure of gradients with a sampling-based algorithm. Crucially, we leverage ReLU-induced gradient sparsity to precisely filter out large numbers of incorrect samples, making a final reconstruction step tractable. We provide an efficient GPU implementation for fully connected networks and show that it recovers high-dimensional ImageNet inputs in batches of up to $b \lesssim 25$ exactly while scaling to large networks. Finally, we show theoretically that much larger batches can be reconstructed with high probability given exponential time."
Poster,SpecExec: Massively Parallel Speculative Decoding For Interactive LLM Inference on Consumer Devices,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95733,"Ruslan Svirschevski, Avner May, Zhuoming Chen, Beidi Chen, Zhihao Jia, Max Ryabinin","As large language models gain widespread adoption, running them efficiently becomes a crucial task. Recent works on LLM inference use speculative decoding to achieve extreme speedups. However, most of these works implicitly design their algorithms for high-end datacenter hardware. In this work, we ask the opposite question: how fast can we run LLMs on consumer machines? Consumer GPUs can no longer fit the largest available models and must offload them to RAM or SSD. With parameter offloading, hundreds or thousands of tokens can be processed in batches within the same time as just one token, making it a natural fit for speculative decoding. We propose SpecExec (Speculative Execution), a simple parallel decoding method that can generate up to 20 tokens per target model iteration for popular LLM families.  SpecExec takes the most probable continuations from the draft model to build a ""cache"" tree for the target model, which then gets validated in a single pass. Using SpecExec, we demonstrate inference of 50B+ parameter LLMs on consumer GPUs with RAM offloading at 4--6 tokens per second with 4-bit quantization or 2--3 tokens per second with 16-bit weights.

Poster,Spec-Gaussian: Anisotropic View-Dependent Appearance for 3D Gaussian Splatting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93509,"Ziyi Yang, Xinyu Gao, Yang-Tian Sun, Yihua Huang, Xiaoyang Lyu, Wen Zhou, Shaohui Jiao, Xiaojuan Qi, Xiaogang Jin","The recent advancements in 3D Gaussian splatting (3D-GS) have not only facilitated real-time rendering through modern GPU rasterization pipelines but have also attained state-of-the-art rendering quality. Nevertheless, despite its exceptional rendering quality and performance on standard datasets, 3D-GS  frequently encounters difficulties in accurately modeling specular and anisotropic components. This issue stems from the limited ability of spherical harmonics (SH) to represent high-frequency information. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Spec-Gaussian, an approach that utilizes an anisotropic spherical Gaussian (ASG) appearance field instead of SH for modeling the view-dependent appearance of each 3D Gaussian. Additionally, we have developed a coarse-to-fine training strategy to improve learning efficiency and eliminate floaters caused by overfitting in real-world scenes. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in terms of rendering quality. Thanks to ASG, we have significantly improved the ability of 3D-GS to model scenes with specular and anisotropic components without increasing the number of 3D Gaussians. This improvement extends the applicability of 3D GS to handle intricate scenarios with specular and anisotropic surfaces."
Poster,Spectral Adapter: Fine-Tuning in Spectral Space,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94943,"Fangzhao Zhang, Mert Pilanci","Recent developments in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods for pretrained deep neural networks have captured widespread interest. In this work, we study the enhancement of current PEFT methods by incorporating the spectral information of pretrained weight matrices into the fine-tuning procedure. We investigate two spectral adaptation mechanisms, namely additive tuning and orthogonal rotation of the top singular vectors, both are done via first carrying out Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of pretrained weights and then fine-tuning the top spectral space. We provide a theoretical analysis of spectral fine-tuning and show that our approach improves the rank capacity of low-rank adapters given a fixed trainable parameter budget. We show through extensive experiments that the proposed fine-tuning model enables better parameter efficiency and tuning performance as well as benefits multi-adapter fusion.  The source code will be open-sourced for reproducibility."
Poster,Spectral Editing of Activations for Large Language Model Alignment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93529,"Yifu QIU, Zheng Zhao, Yftah Ziser, Anna Korhonen, Edoardo Maria Ponti, Shay Cohen","Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit undesirable behaviours, such as generating untruthful or biased content. Editing their internal representations has been shown to be effective in mitigating such behaviours on top of the existing alignment methods. We propose a novel inference-time editing method, namely spectral editing of activations (SEA), to project the input representations into directions with maximal covariance with the positive demonstrations (e.g., truthful) while minimising covariance with the negative demonstrations (e.g., hallucinated). We also extend our method to non-linear editing using feature functions. We run extensive experiments on benchmarks concerning truthfulness and bias with six open-source LLMs of different sizes and model families. The results demonstrate the superiority of SEA in effectiveness, generalisation to similar tasks, as well as computation and data efficiency. We also show that SEA editing only has a limited negative impact on other model capabilities."
Poster,Spectral Graph Pruning Against Over-Squashing and Over-Smoothing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96038,"Adarsh Jamadandi, Celia Rubio-Madrigal, Rebekka Burkholz","Message Passing Graph Neural Networks are known to suffer from two problems that are sometimes believed to be diametrically opposed: over-squashing and over-smoothing. The former results from topological bottlenecks that hamper the information flow from distant nodes and are mitigated by spectral gap maximization, primarily, by means of edge additions. However, such additions often promote over-smoothing that renders nodes of different classes less distinguishable. Inspired by the Braess phenomenon, we argue that deleting edges can address over-squashing and over-smoothing simultaneously. This insight explains how edge deletions can improve generalization, thus connecting spectral gap optimization to a seemingly disconnected objective of reducing computational resources by pruning graphs for lottery tickets. To this end, we propose a computationally effective spectral gap optimization framework to add or delete edges and demonstrate its effectiveness on the long range graph benchmark and on larger heterophilous datasets."
Poster,Spectral Learning of Shared Dynamics Between Generalized-Linear Processes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96067,"Lucine L Oganesian, Omid G. Sani, Maryam Shanechi","Generalized-linear dynamical models (GLDMs) remain a widely-used framework within neuroscience for modeling time-series data, such as neural spiking activity or categorical decision outcomes. Whereas the standard usage of GLDMs is to model a single data source, certain applications require jointly modeling two generalized-linear time-series sources while also dissociating their shared and private dynamics. Most existing GLDM variants and their associated learning algorithms do not support this capability. Here we address this challenge by developing a multi-step analytical subspace identification algorithm for learning a GLDM that explicitly models shared vs. private dynamics within two generalized-linear time-series. In simulations, we demonstrate our algorithm's ability to dissociate and model the dynamics within two time-series sources while being agnostic to their respective observation distributions. In neural data, we consider two specific applications of our algorithm for modeling discrete population spiking activity with respect to a secondary time-series. In both synthetic and real data, GLDMs learned with our algorithm more accurately decoded one time-series from the other using lower-dimensional latent states, as compared to models identified using existing GLDM learning algorithms."
