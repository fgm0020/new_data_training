Poster,Differentiable Quantum Computing for Large-scale Linear Control,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95915,"Connor Clayton, Jiaqi Leng, Gengzhi Yang, Yi-Ling Qiao, Ming Lin, Xiaodi Wu","As industrial models and designs grow increasingly complex, the demand for optimal control of large-scale dynamical systems has significantly increased. However, traditional methods for optimal control incur significant overhead as problem dimensions grow. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end quantum algorithm for linear-quadratic control with provable speedups. Our algorithm, based on a policy gradient method, incorporates a novel quantum subroutine for solving the matrix Lyapunov equation. Specifically, we build a *quantum-assisted differentiable simulator* for efficient gradient estimation that is more accurate and robust than classical methods relying on stochastic approximation. Compared to the classical approaches, our method achieves a *super-quadratic* speedup. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end quantum application to linear control problems with provable quantum advantage."
Poster,Differentiable Structure Learning with Partial Orders,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96218,"Taiyu Ban, Lyuzhou Chen, Xiangyu Wang, Xin Wang, Derui Lyu, Huanhuan Chen","Differentiable structure learning is a novel line of causal discovery research that transforms the combinatorial optimization of structural models into a continuous optimization problem. However, the field has lacked feasible methods to integrate partial order constraints, a critical prior information typically used in real-world scenarios, into the differentiable structure learning framework. The main difficulty lies in adapting these constraints, typically suited for the space of total orderings, to the continuous optimization context of structure learning in the graph space. To bridge this gap, this paper formalizes a set of equivalent constraints that map partial orders onto graph spaces and introduces a plug-and-play module for their efficient application. This module preserves the equivalent effect of partial order constraints in the graph space, backed by theoretical validations of correctness and completeness. It significantly enhances the quality of recovered structures while maintaining good efficiency, which learns better structures using 90\% fewer samples than the data-based method on a real-world dataset. This result, together with a comprehensive evaluation on synthetic cases, demonstrates our method's ability to effectively improve differentiable structure learning with partial orders."
Poster,Differentiable Task Graph Learning: Procedural Activity Representation and Online Mistake Detection from Egocentric Videos,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96827,"Luigi Seminara, Giovanni Maria Farinella, Antonino Furnari","Procedural activities are sequences of key-steps aimed at achieving specific goals. They are crucial to build intelligent agents able to assist users effectively. In this context, task graphs have emerged as a human-understandable representation of procedural activities, encoding a partial ordering over the key-steps. While previous works generally relied on hand-crafted procedures to extract task graphs from videos, in this paper, we propose an approach based on direct maximum likelihood optimization of edges' weights, which allows gradient-based learning of task graphs and can be naturally plugged into neural network architectures. Experiments on the CaptainCook4D dataset demonstrate the ability of our approach to predict accurate task graphs from the observation of action sequences, with an improvement of +16.7% over previous approaches. Owing to the differentiability of the proposed framework, we also introduce a feature-based approach, aiming to predict task graphs from key-step textual or video embeddings, for which we observe emerging video understanding abilities. Task graphs learned with our approach are also shown to significantly enhance online mistake detection in procedural egocentric videos, achieving notable gains of +19.8% and +7.5% on the Assembly101-O and EPIC-Tent-O datasets. Code for replicating the experiments is available at https://github.com/fpv-iplab/Differentiable-Task-Graph-Learning."
Poster,Differentially Private Equivalence Testing for Continuous Distributions and Applications,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93508,"Or Sheffet, Daniel Omer","We present the first algorithm for testing equivalence  between two continuous distributions using differential privacy (DP). Our algorithm is a private version of the algorithm of Diakonikolas et al. The algorithm of Diakonikolas et al uses the data itself to repeatedly discretize the real line so that --- when the two distributions are far apart in ${\cal A}_k$-norm --- one of the discretized distributions exhibits large $L_2$-norm difference; and upon repeated sampling such large gap would be detected. Designing its private analogue poses two difficulties. First, our DP algorithm can not resample new datapoints as a change to a single datapoint may lead to a very large change in the descretization of the real line. In contrast, the (sorted) index of the discretization point changes only by $1$ between neighboring instances, and so we use a novel algorithm that set the discretization points using random Bernoulli noise, resulting in only a few buckets being affected under the right coupling. Second, our algorithm, which doesn't resample data, requires we also revisit the utility analysis of the original algorithm and prove its correctness w.r.t. the original sorted data; a problem we tackle using sampling a subset of Poisson-drawn size from each discretized bin. Lastly, since any distribution can be reduced to a continuous distribution, our algorithm is successfully carried to multiple other families of distributions and thus has numerous applications."
Poster,Differentially Private Graph Diffusion with Applications in Personalized PageRanks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94531,"Rongzhe Wei, Eli Chien, Pan Li","Graph diffusion, which iteratively propagates real-valued substances among the graph, is used in numerous graph/network-involved applications. However, releasing diffusion vectors may reveal sensitive linking information in the data such as transaction information in financial network data. However, protecting the privacy of graph data is challenging due to its interconnected nature.    This work proposes a novel graph diffusion framework with edge-level different privacy guarantees by using noisy diffusion iterates.    The algorithm injects Laplace noise per diffusion iteration and adopts a degree-based thresholding function to mitigate the high sensitivity induced by low-degree nodes. Our privacy loss analysis is based on Privacy Amplification by Iteration (PABI), which to our best knowledge, is the first effort that analyzes PABI with Laplace noise and provides relevant applications.    We also introduce a novel $\infty$-Wasserstein distance tracking method, which tightens the analysis of privacy leakage and makes PABI more applicable in practice.     We evaluate this framework by applying it to Personalized Pagerank computation for ranking tasks. Experiments on real-world network data demonstrate the superiority of our method under stringent privacy conditions."
Poster,Differentially Private Optimization with Sparse Gradients,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96677,"Badih Ghazi, Cristóbal Guzmán, Pritish Kamath, Ravi Kumar, Pasin Manurangsi","Motivated by applications of large embedding models, we study differentially private (DP) optimization problems under sparsity of _individual_ gradients.  We start with  new near-optimal bounds for the classic mean estimation problem but with sparse data, improving upon existing algorithms particularly for the high-dimensional regime. The corresponding lower bounds are based on a novel block-diagonal construction that is combined with existing DP mean estimation lower bounds.Next, we obtain pure- and approximate-DP algorithms with almost optimal rates for stochastic convex optimization with sparse gradients; the former represents the first nearly dimension-independent rates for this problem. Furthermore, by introducing novel analyses of bias reduction in mean estimation and randomly-stopped biased SGD we  obtain nearly dimension-independent rates for near-stationary points for the empirical risk in nonconvex settings under approximate-DP."
Poster,Differentially Private Reinforcement Learning with Self-Play,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95064,"Dan Qiao, Yu-Xiang Wang","We study the problem of multi-agent reinforcement learning (multi-agent RL) with differential privacy (DP) constraints. This is well-motivated by various real-world applications involving sensitive data, where it is critical to protect users' private information. We first extend the definitions of Joint DP (JDP) and Local DP (LDP) to two-player zero-sum episodic Markov Games, where both definitions ensure trajectory-wise privacy protection. Then we design a provably efficient algorithm based on optimistic Nash value iteration and privatization of Bernstein-type bonuses.  The algorithm is able to satisfy JDP and LDP requirements when instantiated with appropriate privacy mechanisms. Furthermore, for both notions of DP, our regret bound generalizes the best known result under the single-agent RL case, while our regret could also reduce to the best known result for multi-agent RL without privacy constraints. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results towards understanding trajectory-wise privacy protection in multi-agent RL."
Poster,Differentially Private Set Representations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95905,"Sarvar Patel, Giuseppe Persiano, Joon Young Seo, Kevin Yeo","We study the problem of differentially private (DP) mechanisms for representingsets of size $k$ from a large universe.Our first construction creates$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP representations with error probability of $1/(e^\epsilon + 1)$ using space at most $1.05 k \epsilon \cdot \log(e)$ bits wherethe time to construct a representation is $O(k \log(1/\delta))$ while decoding time is $O(\log(1/\delta))$.We also present a second algorithm for pure $\epsilon$-DP representations with the same error using space at most $k \epsilon \cdot \log(e)$ bits, but requiring large decoding times.Our algorithms match the lower bounds on privacy-utility trade-offs (including constants but ignoring $\delta$ factors) and we also present a new space lower boundmatching our constructions up to small constant factors.To obtain our results, we design a new approach embedding sets into random linear systemsdeviating from most prior approaches that inject noise into non-private solutions."
Poster,Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent with Fixed-Size Minibatches: Tighter RDP Guarantees with or without Replacement,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95041,"Jeremiah Birrell, Reza Ebrahimi, Rouzbeh Behnia, Jason Pacheco","Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) has been instrumental in privately training deep learning models by providing a framework to control and track the privacy loss incurred during training.  At the core of this computation lies a subsampling method that uses a privacy amplification lemma to enhance the privacy guarantees provided by the additive noise. Fixed size subsampling is appealing for its constant memory usage, unlike the variable sized minibatches in Poisson subsampling. It is also of interest in addressing class imbalance and federated learning. Current computable guarantees for fixed-size subsampling are not tight and do not consider both add/remove and replace-one adjacency relationships. We present a new and holistic Rényi differential privacy (RDP)  accountant for DP-SGD with fixed-size subsampling without replacement (FSwoR) and with replacement (FSwR). For FSwoR we consider both add/remove and replace-one adjacency, where we improve on the best current computable bound by a factor of $4$. We also show for the first time that the widely-used Poisson subsampling and FSwoR with replace-one adjacency have the same privacy to leading order in the sampling probability. Our work suggests that FSwoR is often preferable to Poisson subsampling due to constant memory usage. Our FSwR accountant includes explicit non-asymptotic upper and lower bounds and, to the  authors' knowledge, is the first such RDP analysis of fixed-size  subsampling with replacement  for DP-SGD. We analytically and empirically compare fixed size and Poisson subsampling, and show that DP-SGD gradients in a fixed-size subsampling regime exhibit lower variance in practice in addition to memory usage benefits."
Poster,"Differential Privacy in Scalable General Kernel Learning via $K$-means Nystr{\""o}m Random Features",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95503,"Bonwoo Lee, Jeongyoun Ahn, Cheolwoo Park","As the volume of data invested in statistical learning increases and concerns regarding privacy grow, the privacy leakage issue has drawn significant attention. Differential privacy has emerged as a widely accepted concept capable of mitigating privacy concerns, and numerous differentially private (DP) versions of machine learning algorithms have been developed. However, existing works on DP kernel learning algorithms have exhibited practical limitations, including scalability, restricted choice of kernels, or dependence on test data availability. We propose DP scalable kernel empirical risk minimization (ERM) algorithms and a DP kernel mean embedding (KME) release algorithm suitable for general kernels. Our approaches address the shortcomings of previous algorithms by employing Nyström methods, classical techniques in non-private scalable kernel learning. These methods provide data-dependent low-rank approximations of the kernel matrix for general kernels in a DP manner. We present excess empirical risk bounds and computational complexities for the scalable kernel DP ERM, KME algorithms, contrasting them with established methodologies. Furthermore, we develop a private data-generating algorithm capable of learning diverse kernel models. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the performance of our algorithms, comparing them with existing methods to highlight their superiority."
