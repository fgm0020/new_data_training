Poster,Multimodal Task Vectors Enable Many-Shot Multimodal In-Context Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94861,"Brandon Huang, Chancharik Mitra, Leonid Karlinsky, Assaf Arbelle, Trevor Darrell, Roei Herzig","The recent success of interleaved Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in few-shot learning suggests that in-context learning (ICL) with many examples can be promising for learning new tasks. However, this many-shot multimodal ICL setting has one crucial problem: it is fundamentally limited by the model's context length set at pretraining. The problem is especially prominent in the multimodal domain, which processes both text and images, requiring additional tokens. This motivates the need for a multimodal method to compress many shots into fewer tokens without finetuning. In this work, we enable LMMs to perform multimodal, many-shot in-context learning by leveraging Multimodal Task Vectors (MTV)---compact implicit representations of in-context examples compressed in the model's attention heads. Specifically, we first demonstrate the existence of such MTV in LMMs and then leverage these extracted MTV to enable many-shot in-context learning for various vision-and-language tasks. Our experiments suggest that MTV can scale in performance with the number of compressed shots and generalize to similar out-of-domain tasks without additional context length for inference.

Poster,Multi-modal Transfer Learning between Biological Foundation Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93095,"Juan Jose Garau-Luis, Patrick Bordes, Liam Gonzalez, Maša Roller, Bernardo de Almeida, Christopher Blum, Lorenz Hexemer, Stefan Laurent, Maren Lang, Thomas Pierrot, Guillaume Richard","Biological sequences encode fundamental instructions for the building blocks of life, in the form of DNA, RNA, and proteins. Modeling these sequences is key to understand disease mechanisms and is an active research area in computational biology. Recently, Large Language Models have shown great promise in solving certain biological tasks but current approaches are limited to a single sequence modality (DNA, RNA, or protein). Key problems in genomics intrinsically involve multiple modalities, but it remains unclear how to adapt general-purpose sequence models to those cases. In this work we propose a multi-modal model that connects DNA, RNA, and proteins by leveraging information from different pre-trained modality-specific encoders. We demonstrate its capabilities by applying it to the largely unsolved problem of predicting how multiple \rna transcript isoforms originate from the same gene (i.e. same DNA sequence) and map to different transcription expression levels across various human tissues. We show that our model, dubbed IsoFormer, is able to accurately predict differential transcript expression, outperforming existing methods and leveraging the use of multiple modalities. Our framework also achieves efficient transfer knowledge from the encoders pre-training as well as in between modalities. We open-source our model, paving the way for new multi-modal gene expression approaches."
Poster,Multi-model Ensemble Conformal Prediction in Dynamic Environments,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95742,"Erfan Hajihashemi, Yanning Shen","Conformal prediction is an uncertainty quantification method that constructs a prediction set for a previously unseen datum, ensuring the true label is included with a predetermined coverage probability. Adaptive conformal prediction has been developed to address data distribution shifts in dynamic environments. However, the efficiency of prediction sets varies depending on the learning model used. Employing a single fixed model may not consistently offer the best performance in dynamic environments with unknown data distribution shifts. To address this issue, we introduce a novel adaptive conformal prediction framework, where the model used for creating prediction sets is selected ‘on the fly’ from multiple candidate models. The proposed algorithm is proven to achieve strongly adaptive regret over all intervals while maintaining valid coverage. Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets corroborate that the proposed approach consistently yields more efficient prediction sets while maintaining valid coverage, outperforming alternative methods."
Poster,Multi-Object 3D Grounding with Dynamic Modules and Language-Informed Spatial Attention,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93971,"Haomeng Zhang, Chiao-An Yang, Raymond A. Yeh","Multi-object 3D Grounding involves locating 3D boxes based on a given query phrase from a point cloud. It is a challenging and significant task that has numerous applications in visual understanding, human-computer interaction, and robotics. To tackle this challenge, we introduce D-LISA, a two-stage approach that incorporates three innovations. First, a dynamic vision module that enables a variable and learnable number of box proposals. Second, a dynamic camera positioning that extracts features for each proposal. Third, a language-informed spatial attention module that better reasons over the proposals to output the final prediction. Empirically, experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on multi-object 3D grounding by 12.8% (absolute) and is competitive in single-object 3D grounding."
Poster,Multi-Object Hallucination in Vision Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95666,"Xuweiyi Chen, Ziqiao Ma, Xuejun Zhang, Sihan Xu, Shengyi Qian, Jianing Yang, David Fouhey, Joyce Chai","Large vision language models (LVLMs) often suffer from object hallucination, producing objects not present in the given images. While current benchmarks for object hallucination primarily concentrate on the presence of a single object class rather than individual entities, this work systematically investigates multi-object hallucination, examining how models misperceive (e.g., invent nonexistent objects or become distracted) when tasked with focusing on multiple objects simultaneously.We introduce Recognition-based Object Probing Evaluation (ROPE), an automated evaluation protocol that considers the distribution of object classes within a single image during testing and uses visual referring prompts to eliminate ambiguity. With comprehensive empirical studies and analysis of potential factors leading to multi-object hallucination, we found that (1) LVLMs suffer more hallucinations when focusing on multiple objects compared to a single object. (2) The tested object class distribution affects hallucination behaviors, indicating that LVLMs may follow shortcuts and spurious correlations.(3) Hallucinatory behaviors are influenced by data-specific factors, salience and frequency, and model intrinsic behaviors.We hope to enable LVLMs to recognize and reason about multiple objects that often occur in realistic visual scenes, provide insights, and quantify our progress towards mitigating the issues."
Poster,MultiOOD: Scaling Out-of-Distribution Detection for Multiple Modalities,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96280,"Hao Dong, Yue Zhao, Eleni Chatzi, Olga Fink","Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is important for deploying machine learning models in safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving and robot-assisted surgery. Existing research has mainly focused on unimodal scenarios on image data. However, real-world applications are inherently multimodal, which makes it essential to leverage information from multiple modalities to enhance the efficacy of OOD detection. To establish a foundation for more realistic Multimodal OOD Detection, we introduce the first-of-its-kind benchmark, MultiOOD, characterized by diverse dataset sizes and varying modality combinations. We first evaluate existing unimodal OOD detection algorithms on MultiOOD, observing that the mere inclusion of additional modalities yields substantial improvements. This underscores the importance of utilizing multiple modalities for OOD detection. Based on the observation of Modality Prediction Discrepancy between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data, and its strong correlation with OOD performance, we propose the Agree-to-Disagree (A2D) algorithm to encourage such discrepancy during training. Moreover, we introduce a novel outlier synthesis method, NP-Mix, which explores broader feature spaces by leveraging the information from nearest neighbor classes and complements A2D to strengthen OOD detection performance. Extensive experiments on MultiOOD demonstrate that training with A2D and NP-Mix improves existing OOD detection algorithms by a large margin. To support accessibility and reproducibility, our source code and MultiOOD benchmark are available at https://github.com/donghao51/MultiOOD."
Poster,MultiOrg: A Multi-rater Organoid-detection Dataset,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97645,"Christina Bukas, Harshavardhan Subramanian, Fenja See, Carina Steinchen, Ivan Ezhov, Gowtham Boosarpu, Sara Asgharpour, Gerald Burgstaller, Mareike Lehmann, Florian Kofler, Marie Piraud","High-throughput image analysis in the biomedical domain has gained significant attention in recent years, driving advancements in drug discovery, disease prediction, and personalized medicine. Organoids, specifically, are an active area of research, providing excellent models for human organs and their functions. Automating the quantification of organoids in microscopy images would provide an effective solution to overcome substantial manual quantification bottlenecks, particularly in high-throughput image analysis. However, there is a notable lack of open biomedical datasets, in contrast to other domains, such as autonomous driving, and, notably, only few of them have attempted to quantify annotation uncertainty. In this work, we present MultiOrg a comprehensive organoid dataset tailored for object detection tasks with uncertainty quantification. This dataset comprises over 400 high-resolution 2d microscopy images and curated annotations of more than 60,000 organoids. Most importantly, it includes three label sets for the test data, independently annotated by two experts at distinct time points. We additionally provide a benchmark for organoid detection, and make the best model available through an easily installable, interactive plugin for the popular image visualization tool Napari, to perform organoid quantification."
Poster,Multiple Physics Pretraining for Spatiotemporal Surrogate Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96095,"Michael McCabe, Bruno Régaldo-Saint Blancard, Liam Parker, Ruben Ohana, Miles Cranmer, Alberto Bietti, Michael Eickenberg, Siavash Golkar, Geraud Krawezik, Francois Lanusse, Mariel Pettee, Tiberiu Tesileanu, Kyunghyun Cho, Shirley Ho","We introduce multiple physics pretraining (MPP), an autoregressive task-agnostic pretraining approach for physical surrogate modeling of spatiotemporal systems with transformers. In MPP, rather than training one model on a specific physical system, we train a backbone model to predict the dynamics of multiple heterogeneous physical systems simultaneously in order to learn features that are broadly useful across systems and facilitate transfer. In order to learn effectively in this setting, we introduce a shared embedding and normalization strategy that projects the fields of multiple systems into a shared embedding space. We validate the efficacy of our approach on both pretraining and downstream tasks over a broad fluid mechanics-oriented benchmark. We show that a single MPP-pretrained transformer is able to match or outperform task-specific baselines on all pretraining sub-tasks without the need for finetuning. For downstream tasks, we demonstrate that finetuning MPP-trained models results in more accurate predictions across multiple time-steps on systems with previously unseen physical components or higher dimensional systems compared to training from scratch or finetuning pretrained video foundation models. We open-source our code and model weights trained at multiple scales for reproducibility."
Poster,MultiPull: Detailing Signed Distance Functions by Pulling Multi-Level Queries at Multi-Step,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94734,"Takeshi Noda, Chao Chen, Weiqi Zhang, Xinhai Liu, Yu-Shen Liu, Zhizhong Han","Reconstructing a continuous surface from a raw 3D point cloud is a challenging task. Latest methods employ supervised learning or pretrained priors to learn a signed distance function (SDF). However, neural networks tend to smooth local details due to the lack of ground truth signed distnaces or normals, which limits the performance of learning-based methods in reconstruction tasks. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel method, named MultiPull, to learn multi-scale implicit fields from raw point clouds to optimize accurate SDFs from coarse to fine. We achieve this by mapping 3D query points into a set of frequency features, which makes it possible to leverage multi-level features during optimization. Meanwhile, we introduce optimization constraints from the perspective of spatial distance and normal consistency, which play a key role in point cloud reconstruction based on multi-scale optimization strategies. Our experiments on widely used object and scene benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in surface reconstruction."
Poster,Multi-Reward Best Policy Identification,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93103,"Alessio Russo, Filippo Vannella","Rewards are a critical aspect of formulating  Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems; often, one may be interested in testing multiple reward functions, or the problem may naturally involve multiple rewards. In this study, we investigate the _Multi-Reward Best Policy Identification_ (MR-BPI) problem, where the goal is to determine the best policy for all rewards in a given set $\mathcal{R}$ with minimal sample complexity and a prescribed confidence level. We derive a fundamental instance-specific lower bound on the sample complexity required by any Probably Correct (PC) algorithm in this setting. This bound guides the design of an optimal exploration policy attaining minimal sample complexity. However, this lower bound involves solving a hard non-convex optimization problem. We address this challenge by devising a convex approximation, enabling the design of sample-efficient algorithms.  We propose MR-NaS, a PC algorithm with competitive performance on hard-exploration tabular environments. Extending this approach to Deep RL (DRL), we also introduce DBMR-BPI, an efficient algorithm for model-free exploration in multi-reward settings."
