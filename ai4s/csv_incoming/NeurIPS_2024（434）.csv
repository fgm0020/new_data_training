Poster,Unveiling the Bias Impact on Symmetric Moral Consistency of Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93215,"Ziyi Zhou, Xinwei Guo, Jiashi Gao, Xiangyu Zhao, Shiyao Zhang, Xin Yao, Xuetao Wei","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, surpassing human experts in various benchmark tests and playing a vital role in various industry sectors. Despite their effectiveness, a notable drawback of LLMs is their inconsistent moral behavior, which raises ethical concerns. This work delves into symmetric moral consistency in large language models and demonstrates that modern LLMs lack sufficient consistency ability in moral scenarios. Our extensive investigation of twelve popular LLMs reveals that their assessed consistency scores are influenced by position bias and selection bias rather than their intrinsic abilities. We propose a new framework tSMC, which gauges the effects of these biases and effectively mitigates the bias impact based on the Kullback–Leibler divergence to pinpoint LLMs' mitigated Symmetric Moral Consistency. We find that the ability of LLMs to maintain consistency varies across different moral scenarios. Specifically, LLMs show more consistency in scenarios with clear moral answers compared to those where no choice is morally perfect. The average consistency score of 12 LLMs ranges from $60.7\%$ in high-ambiguity moral scenarios to $84.8\%$ in low-ambiguity moral scenarios."
Poster,Unveiling the Hidden: Online Vectorized HD Map Construction with Clip-Level Token Interaction and Propagation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92975,"Nayeon Kim, Hongje Seong, Daehyun Ji, Sujin Jang","Predicting and constructing road geometric information (e.g., lane lines, road markers) is a crucial task for safe autonomous driving, while such static map elements can be repeatedly occluded by various dynamic objects on the road. Recent studies have shown significantly improved vectorized high-definition (HD) map construction performance, but there has been insufficient investigation of temporal information across adjacent input frames (i.e., clips), which may lead to inconsistent and suboptimal prediction results. To tackle this, we introduce a novel paradigm of clip-level vectorized HD map construction, MapUnveiler, which explicitly unveils the occluded map elements within a clip input by relating dense image representations with efficient clip tokens. Additionally, MapUnveiler associates inter-clip information through clip token propagation, effectively utilizing long- term temporal map information. MapUnveiler runs efficiently with the proposed clip-level pipeline by avoiding redundant computation with temporal stride while building a global map relationship. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MapUnveiler achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmark datasets. We also showcase that MapUnveiler significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in a challenging setting, achieving +10.7% mAP improvement in heavily occluded driving road scenes.

Poster,Unveiling the Hidden Structure of Self-Attention via Kernel Principal Component Analysis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94894,"Rachel S.Y. Teo, Tan Nguyen","The remarkable success of transformers in sequence modeling tasks, spanning various applications in natural language processing and computer vision, is attributed to the critical role of self-attention. Similar to the development of most deep learning models, the construction of these attention mechanisms relies on heuristics and experience. In our work, we derive self-attention from kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA) and show that self-attention projects its query vectors onto the principal component axes of its key matrix in a feature space. We then formulate the exact formula for the value matrix in self-attention, theoretically and empirically demonstrating that this value matrix captures the eigenvectors of the Gram matrix of the key vectors in self-attention. Leveraging our kernel PCA framework, we propose Attention with Robust Principal Components (RPC-Attention), a novel class of robust attention that is resilient to data contamination. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of RPC-Attention over softmax attention on the ImageNet-1K object classification, WikiText-103 language modeling, and ADE20K image segmentation task."
Poster,Unveiling The Matthew Effect Across Channels: Assessing Layer Width Sufficiency via Weight Norm Variance,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95024,"Yiting Chen, Jiazi Bu, Junchi Yan","The trade-off between cost and performance has been a longstanding and critical issue for deep neural networks. One key factor affecting the computational cost is the width of each layer. However, in practice, the width of layers in a neural network is mostly empirically determined. In this paper, we show that a pattern regarding the variance of weight norm corresponding to different channels can indicate whether the layer is sufficiently wide and may help us better allocate computational resources across the layers.Starting from a simple intuition that channels with larger weights would have larger gradients and the difference in weight norm enlarges between channels with similar weight, we empirically validate that wide and narrow layers show two different patterns with experiments across different data modalities and network architectures. Based on the two different patterns, we identify three stages during training and explain each stage with corresponding evidence. We further propose to adjust the width based on the identified pattern and show that conventional layer width settings for CNNs could be adjusted to reduce the number of parameters while boosting the performance."
Poster,Unveiling the Potential of Robustness in Selecting Conditional Average Treatment Effect Estimators,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93920,"Yiyan Huang, Cheuk Hang LEUNG, Siyi WANG, YIJUN LI, Qi WU","The growing demand for personalized decision-making has led to a surge of interest in estimating the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE). Various types of CATE estimators have been developed with advancements in machine learning and causal inference. However, selecting the desirable CATE estimator through a conventional model validation procedure remains impractical due to the absence of counterfactual outcomes in observational data. Existing approaches for CATE estimator selection, such as plug-in and pseudo-outcome metrics, face two challenges. First, they must determine the metric form and the underlying machine learning models for fitting nuisance parameters (e.g., outcome function, propensity function, and plug-in learner). Second, they lack a specific focus on selecting a robust CATE estimator. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a Distributionally Robust Metric (DRM) for CATE estimator selection. The proposed DRM is nuisance-free, eliminating the need to fit models for nuisance parameters, and it effectively prioritizes the selection of a distributionally robust CATE estimator. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the DRM method in selecting CATE estimators that are robust to the distribution shift incurred by covariate shift and hidden confounders."
Poster,Unveiling the Tapestry of Consistency in Large Vision-Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93307,"Yuan Zhang, Fei xiao, Tao Huang, Chun-Kai Fan, Hongyuan Dong, Jiawen Li, Jiacong Wang, Kuan Cheng, Shanghang Zhang, Haoyuan Guo","Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved rapid progress, exhibiting great perception and reasoning abilities concerning visual information. However, when faced with prompts in different sizes of solution spaces, LVLMs fail to always give consistent answers regarding the same knowledge point. This inconsistency of answers between different solution spaces is prevalent in LVLMs and erodes trust. To this end, we provide a multi-modal benchmark ConBench, to intuitively analyze how LVLMs perform when the solution space of a prompt revolves around a knowledge point. Based on the ConBench tool, we are the first to reveal the tapestry and get the following findings: (1) In the discriminate realm, the larger the solution space of the prompt, the lower the accuracy of the answers. (2) Establish the relationship between the discriminative and generative realms: the accuracy of the discriminative question type exhibits a strong positive correlation with its Consistency with the caption. (3) Compared to open-source models, closed-source models exhibit a pronounced bias advantage in terms of Consistency. Eventually, we ameliorate the consistency of LVLMs by trigger-based diagnostic refinement, indirectly improving the performance of their caption. We hope this paper will accelerate the research community in better evaluating their models and encourage future advancements in the consistency domain."
Poster,Unveiling User Satisfaction and Creator Productivity Trade-Offs in Recommendation Platforms,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95779,"Fan Yao, Yiming Liao, Jingzhou Liu, Shaoliang Nie, Qifan Wang, Haifeng Xu, Hongning Wang","On User-Generated Content (UGC) platforms, recommendation algorithms significantly impact creators' motivation to produce content as they compete for algorithmically allocated user traffic. This phenomenon subtly shapes the volume and diversity of the content pool, which is crucial for the platform's sustainability. In this work, we demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that a purely relevance-driven policy with low exploration strength boosts short-term user satisfaction but undermines the long-term richness of the content pool. In contrast, a more aggressive exploration policy may slightly compromise user satisfaction but promote higher content creation volume. Our findings reveal a fundamental trade-off between immediate user satisfaction and overall content production on UGC platforms. Building on this finding, we propose an efficient optimization method to identify the optimal exploration strength, balancing user and creator engagement. Our model can serve as a pre-deployment audit tool for recommendation algorithms on UGC platforms, helping to align their immediate objectives with sustainable, long-term goals."
Poster,Upping the Game: How 2D U-Net Skip Connections Flip 3D Segmentation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95244,"Xingru Huang, yihao guo, Jian Huang, Tianyun Zhang, HE HONG, Shaowei Jiang, Yaoqi Sun","In the present study, we introduce an innovative structure for 3D medical image segmentation that effectively integrates 2D U-Net-derived skip connections into the architecture of 3D convolutional neural networks (3D CNNs). Conventional 3D segmentation techniques predominantly depend on isotropic 3D convolutions for the extraction of volumetric features, which frequently engenders inefficiencies due to the varying information density across the three orthogonal axes in medical imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This disparity leads to a decline in axial-slice plane feature extraction efficiency, with slice plane features being comparatively underutilized relative to features in the time-axial. To address this issue, we introduce the U-shaped Connection (uC), utilizing simplified 2D U-Net in place of standard skip connections to augment the extraction of the axial-slice plane features while concurrently preserving the volumetric context afforded by 3D convolutions. Based on uC, we further present uC 3DU-Net, an enhanced 3D U-Net backbone that integrates the uC approach to facilitate optimal axial-slice plane feature utilization. Through rigorous experimental validation on five publicly accessible datasets—FLARE2021, OIMHS, FeTA2021, AbdomenCT-1K, and BTCV, the proposed method surpasses contemporary state-of-the-art models. Notably, this performance is achieved while reducing the number of parameters and computational complexity. This investigation underscores the efficacy of incorporating 2D convolutions within the framework of 3D CNNs to overcome the intrinsic limitations of volumetric segmentation, thereby potentially expanding the frontiers of medical image analysis. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/IMOP-lab/U-Shaped-Connection."
Poster,UPS: Unified Projection Sharing for Lightweight Single-Image Super-resolution and Beyond,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93322,"Kun Zhou, Xinyu Lin, Zhonghang LIU, Xiaoguang Han, Jiangbo Lu","To date, transformer-based frameworks have demonstrated impressive results in single-image super-resolution (SISR). However, under practical lightweight scenarios, the complex interaction of deep image feature extraction and similarity modeling limits the performance of these methods, since they require simultaneous layer-specific optimization of both two tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel Unified Projection Sharing algorithm(UPS) to decouple the feature extraction and similarity modeling, achieving notable performance. To do this, we establish a unified projection space defined by a learnable projection matrix, for similarity calculation across all self-attention layers. As a result, deep image feature extraction remains a per-layer optimization manner, while similarity modeling is carried out by projecting these image features onto the shared projection space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed UPS achieves state-of-the-art performance relative to leading lightweight SISR methods, as verified by various popular benchmarks. Moreover, our unified optimized projection space exhibits encouraging robustness performance for unseen data (degraded and depth images). Finally, UPS also demonstrates promising results across various image restoration tasks, including real-world and classic SISR, image denoising, and image deblocking."
Poster,UQE: A Query Engine for Unstructured Databases,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93360,"Hanjun Dai, Bethany Wang, Xingchen Wan, Bo Dai, Sherry Yang, Azade Nova, Pengcheng Yin, Mangpo Phothilimthana, Charles Sutton, Dale Schuurmans","Analytics on structured data is a mature field with many successful methods.However, most real world data exists in unstructured form, such as images and conversations.We investigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable unstructured data analytics.In particular, we propose a new Universal Query Engine (UQE) that directly interrogates and draws insights from unstructured data collections.This engine accepts queries in a Universal Query Language (UQL), a dialect of SQL that provides full natural language flexibility in specifying conditions and operators.The new engine leverages the ability of LLMs to conduct analysis of unstructured data, while also allowing us to exploit advances in sampling and optimization techniques to achieve efficient and accurate query execution.In addition, we borrow techniques from classical compiler theory to better orchestrate the workflow between sampling methods and foundation model calls.We demonstrate the efficiency of UQE on data analytics across different modalities, including images, dialogs and reviews, across a range of useful query types, including conditional aggregation, semantic retrieval and abstraction aggregation."
