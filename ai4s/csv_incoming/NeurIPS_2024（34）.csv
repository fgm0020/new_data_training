Poster,Are More LLM Calls All You Need? Towards the Scaling Properties of Compound AI Systems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93777,"Lingjiao Chen, Jared Quincy Davis, Boris Hanin, Peter Bailis, Ion Stoica, Matei A Zaharia, James Zou","Many recent state-of-the-art results in language tasks were achieved using compound systems that perform multiple Language Model (LM) calls and aggregate their responses. However, there is little understanding of how the number of LM calls -- e.g., when asking the LM to answer each question multiple times and taking a majority vote -- affects such a compound system's performance. In this paper, we initiate the study of scaling properties of compound inference systems. We analyze, theoretically and empirically, how the number of LM calls affects the performance of Vote and Filter-Vote, two of the simplest compound system designs, which aggregate LM responses via majority voting, optionally applying LM filters. We find, surprisingly, that across multiple language tasks, the performance of both Vote and Filter-Vote can first increase but then decrease as a function of the number of LM calls. Our theoretical results suggest that this non-monotonicity is due to the diversity of query difficulties within a task: more LM calls lead to higher performance on ""easy"" queries, but lower performance on ""hard"" queries, and non-monotone behavior can emerge when a task contains both types of queries. This insight then allows us to compute, from a small number of samples, the number of LM calls that maximizes system performance, and define an analytical scaling model for both systems. Experiments show that our scaling model can accurately predict the performance of Vote and Filter-Vote systems and thus find the optimal number of LM calls to make."
Poster,Are Multiple Instance Learning Algorithms Learnable for Instances?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94412,"Jaeseok Jang, HYUK-YOON KWON","Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has been increasingly adopted to mitigate the high costs and complexity associated with labeling individual instances, learning instead from bags of instances labeled at the bag level and enabling instance-level labeling. While existing research has primarily focused on the learnability of MIL at the bag level, there is an absence of theoretical exploration to check if a given MIL algorithm is learnable at the instance level. This paper proposes a theoretical framework based on probably approximately correct (PAC) learning theory to assess the instance-level learnability of deep multiple instance learning (Deep MIL) algorithms. Our analysis exposes significant gaps between current Deep MIL algorithms, highlighting the theoretical conditions that must be satisfied by MIL algorithms to ensure instance-level learnability. With these conditions, we interpret the learnability of the representative Deep MIL algorithms and validate them through empirical studies."
Poster,Are nuclear masks all you need for improved out-of-domain generalisation? A closer look at cancer classification in histopathology,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96177,"Dhananjay Tomar, Alexander Binder, Andreas Kleppe","Domain generalisation in computational histopathology is challenging because the images are substantially affected by differences among hospitals due to factors like fixation and staining of tissue and imaging equipment. We hypothesise that focusing on nuclei can improve the out-of-domain (OOD) generalisation in cancer detection. We propose a simple approach to improve OOD generalisation for cancer detection by focusing on nuclear morphology and organisation, as these are domain-invariant features critical in cancer detection. Our approach integrates original images with nuclear segmentation masks during training, encouraging the model to prioritise nuclei and their spatial arrangement. Going beyond mere data augmentation, we introduce a regularisation technique that aligns the representations of masks and original images. We show, using multiple datasets, that our method improves OOD generalisation and also leads to increased robustness to image corruptions and adversarial attacks.

Poster,Are Self-Attentions Effective for Time Series Forecasting?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94012,"Dongbin Kim, Jinseong Park, Jaewook Lee, Hoki Kim","Time series forecasting is crucial for applications across multiple domains and various scenarios. Although Transformers have dramatically advanced the landscape of forecasting, their effectiveness remains debated. Recent findings have indicated that simpler linear models might outperform complex Transformer-based approaches, highlighting the potential for more streamlined architectures. In this paper, we shift the focus from evaluating the overall Transformer architecture to specifically examining the effectiveness of self-attention for time series forecasting. To this end, we introduce a new architecture, Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS), that rethinks the traditional transformer framework by eliminating self-attention and leveraging cross-attention mechanisms instead. By establishing future horizon-dependent parameters as queries and enhanced parameter sharing, our model not only improves long-term forecasting accuracy but also reduces the number of parameters and memory usage. Extensive experiment across various datasets demonstrates that our model achieves superior performance with the lowest mean squared error and uses fewer parameters compared to existing models.The implementation of our model is available at: https://github.com/dongbeank/CATS."
Poster,"A Retrospective on the Robot Air Hockey Challenge: Benchmarking Robust, Reliable, and Safe Learning Techniques for Real-world Robotics",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97579,"Puze Liu, Jonas Günster, Niklas Funk, Simon Gröger, Dong Chen, Haitham Bou Ammar, Julius Jankowski, Ante Marić, Sylvain Calinon, Andrej Orsula, Miguel Olivares, Hongyi Zhou, Rudolf Lioutikov, Gerhard Neumann, Amarildo Likmeta, Amirhossein Zhalehmehrabi, Thomas Bonenfant, Marcello Restelli, Davide Tateo, Ziyuan Liu, Jan Peters","Machine learning methods have a groundbreaking impact in many application domains, but their application on real robotic platforms is still limited.Despite the many challenges associated with combining machine learning technology with robotics, robot learning remains one of the most promising directions for enhancing the capabilities of robots. When deploying learning-based approaches on real robots, extra effort is required to address the challenges posed by various real-world factors. To investigate the key factors influencing real-world deployment and to encourage original solutions from different researchers, we organized the Robot Air Hockey Challenge at the NeurIPS 2023 conference. We selected the air hockey task as a benchmark, encompassing low-level robotics problems and high-level tactics. Different from other machine learning-centric benchmarks, participants need to tackle practical challenges in robotics, such as the sim-to-real gap, low-level control issues, safety problems, real-time requirements, and the limited availability of real-world data. Furthermore, we focus on a dynamic environment, removing the typical assumption of quasi-static motions of other real-world benchmarks.The competition's results show that solutions combining learning-based approaches with prior knowledge outperform those relying solely on data when real-world deployment is challenging.Our ablation study reveals which real-world factors may be overlooked when building a learning-based solution.The successful real-world air hockey deployment of best-performing agents sets the foundation for future competitions and follow-up research directions."
Poster,Are Uncertainty Quantification Capabilities of Evidential Deep Learning a Mirage?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95329,"Maohao Shen, Jongha (Jon) Ryu, Soumya Ghosh, Yuheng Bu, Prasanna Sattigeri, Subhro Das, Gregory Wornell","This paper questions the effectiveness of a modern predictive uncertainty quantification approach, called *evidential deep learning* (EDL), in which a single neural network model is trained to learn a meta distribution over the predictive distribution by minimizing a specific objective function. Despite their perceived strong empirical performance on downstream tasks, a line of recent studies by Bengs et al. identify limitations of the existing methods to conclude their learned epistemic uncertainties are unreliable, e.g., in that they are non-vanishing even with infinite data. Building on and sharpening such analysis, we 1) provide a sharper understanding of the asymptotic behavior of a wide class of EDL methods by unifying various objective functions; 2) reveal that the EDL methods can be better interpreted as an out-of-distribution detection algorithm based on energy-based-models; and  3) conduct extensive ablation studies to better assess their empirical effectiveness with real-world datasets. Through all these analyses, we conclude that even when EDL methods are empirically effective on downstream tasks, this occurs despite their poor uncertainty quantification capabilities. Our investigation suggests that incorporating model uncertainty can help EDL methods faithfully quantify uncertainties and further improve performance on representative downstream tasks, albeit at the cost of additional computational complexity."
Poster,Are We on the Right Way for Evaluating Large Vision-Language Models?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94237,"Lin Chen, Jinsong Li, Xiaoyi Dong, Pan Zhang, Yuhang Zang, Zehui Chen, Haodong Duan, Jiaqi Wang, Yu Qiao, Dahua Lin, Feng Zhao","Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved rapid progress, sparking numerous studies to evaluate their multi-modal capabilities. However, we dig into current evaluation works and identify two primary issues: 1) Visual content is unnecessary for many samples. The answers can be directly inferred from the questions and options, or the world knowledge embedded in LLMs. This phenomenon is prevalent across current benchmarks. For instance, GeminiPro achieves 42.7% on the MMMU benchmark without any visual input, and outperforms the random choice baseline across six benchmarks near 24% on average. 2) Unintentional data leakage exists in LLM and LVLM training. LLM and LVLM could still answer some visual-necessary questions without visual content, indicating the memorizing of these samples within large-scale training data. For example, Sphinx-X-MoE gets 43.6% on MMMU without accessing images, surpassing its LLM backbone with 17.9%. Both problems lead to misjudgments of actual multi-modal gains and potentially misguide the study of LVLM. To this end, we present MMStar, an elite vision-indispensable multi-modal benchmark comprising 1,500 samples meticulously selected by humans. MMStar benchmarks 6 core capabilities and 18 detailed axes, aiming to evaluate LVLMs' multi-modal capacities with carefully balanced and purified samples. These samples are first roughly selected from current benchmarks with an automated pipeline, human review is then involved to ensure each curated sample exhibits visual dependency, minimal data leakage, and requires advanced multi-modal capabilities. Moreover, two metrics are developed to measure data leakage and actual performance gain in multi-modal training. We evaluate 16 leading LVLMs on MMStar to assess their multi-modal capabilities, and on 7 benchmarks with the proposed metrics to investigate their data leakage and actual multi-modal gain."
Poster,Are Your Models Still Fair? Fairness Attacks on Graph Neural Networks via Node Injections,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95562,"Zihan Luo, Hong Huang, Yongkang Zhou, Jiping Zhang, Nuo Chen, Hai Jin","Despite the remarkable capabilities demonstrated by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in graph-related tasks, recent research has revealed the fairness vulnerabilities in GNNs when facing malicious adversarial attacks. However, all existing fairness attacks require manipulating the connectivity between existing nodes, which may be prohibited in reality. To this end, we introduce a Node Injection-based Fairness Attack (NIFA), exploring the vulnerabilities of GNN fairness in such a more realistic setting. In detail, NIFA first designs two insightful principles for node injection operations, namely the uncertainty-maximization principle and homophily-increase principle, and then optimizes injected nodes’ feature matrix to further ensure the effectiveness of fairness attacks. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets consistently demonstrate that NIFA can significantly undermine the fairness of mainstream GNNs, even including fairness-aware GNNs, by injecting merely 1% of nodes. We sincerely hope that our work can stimulate increasing attention from researchers on the vulnerability of GNN fairness, and encourage the development of corresponding defense mechanisms. Our code and data are released at: https://github.com/CGCL-codes/NIFA."
Poster,ArkVale: Efficient Generative LLM Inference with Recallable Key-Value Eviction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96635,"Renze Chen, Zhuofeng Wang, Beiquan Cao, Tong Wu, Size Zheng, Xiuhong Li, Xuechao Wei, Shengen Yan, Meng Li, Yun Liang","Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in today's tasks of natural language processing. To support applications like multi-turn chats, document understanding, and content generation, models with long context lengths are growing in importance.However, managing long contexts brings substantial challenges due to the expansion of key-value cache (KV cache). Longer KV cache requires larger memory, limiting the batch-size thus decreasing throughput. Also, computing attention over long KV cache incurs more memory access, hurting the end-to-end latency.Prior works find that it is sufficient to use only the recent and high-impact tokens for attention computation, allowing the eviction of less vital tokens to shrink cache size.Nonetheless, we observe a dynamic shift in token importance across different decoding steps. Tokens initially evicted might regain importance after certain decoding steps.To address this, we propose ArkVale, a page-based KV cache manager that can recognize and recall currently important tokens evicted before. We asynchronously copy the filled page into external memory (e.g., CPU memory) as backup and summarize it into a much smaller digest by constructing the bounding-volume of its keys. Before attention computation, we measure all pages' importance based on their digests, recall the important ones, evict the unimportant ones, and select the top-ranked pages for attention computation. Experiment results show that ArkVale performs well on various long context tasks with negligible accuracy loss under 2k$\sim$4k cache budget and can improve decoding latency to $2.2\times$ and batching throughput to $4.6\times$ because it applies attention on only a small subset of pages and reduce per-sample memory usage of KV cache."
Poster,A robust inlier identification algorithm for point cloud registration via $\mathbf{\ell_0}$-minimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96199,"Yinuo Jiang, Xiuchuan Tang, Cheng Cheng, Ye Yuan","Correspondences in point cloud registration are prone to outliers, significantly reducing registration accuracy and highlighting the need for precise inlier identification. In this paper, we propose a robust inlier identification algorithm for point cloud registration by reformulating the conventional registration problem as an alignment error $\ell_0$-minimization problem. The $\ell_0$-minimization problem is formulated for each local set, where those local sets are built on a compatibility graph of input correspondences. To resolve the $\ell_0$-minimization, we develop a novel two-stage decoupling strategy, which first decouples the alignment error into a rotation fitting error and a translation fitting error. Second, null-space matrices are employed to decouple inlier identification from the estimation of rotation and translation respectively, thereby applying Bayesian theory to $\ell_0$-minimization problems and solving for fitting errors. Correspondences with the smallest errors are identified as inliers to generate a transformation hypothesis for each local set. The best hypothesis is selected to perform registration. We demonstrate that the proposed inlier identification algorithm is robust under high outlier ratios and noise through experiments. Extensive results on the KITTI, 3DMatch, and 3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to both traditional and learning-based methods in various indoor and outdoor scenes."
