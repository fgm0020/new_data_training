Poster,Adaptive Depth Networks with Skippable Sub-Paths,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95440,"Woochul Kang, HYUNGSEOP LEE","Predictable adaptation of network depths can be an effective way to control inference latency and meet the resource condition of various devices. However, previous adaptive depth networks do not provide general principles and a formal explanation on why and which layers can be skipped, and, hence, their approaches are hard to be generalized and require long and complex training steps. In this paper, we present a practical approach to adaptive depth networks that is applicable to various networks with minimal training effort. In our approach, every hierarchical residual stage is divided into two sub-paths, and they are trained to acquire different properties through a simple self-distillation strategy. While the first sub-path is essential for hierarchical feature learning, the second one is trained to refine the learned features and minimize performance degradation if it is skipped. Unlike prior adaptive networks, our approach does not train every target sub-network in an iterative manner. At test time, however, we can connect these sub-paths in a combinatorial manner to select sub-networks of various accuracy-efficiency trade-offs from a single network. We provide a formal rationale for why the proposed training method can reduce overall prediction errors while minimizing the impact of skipping sub-paths. We demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our approach with convolutional neural networks and transformers."
Poster,Adaptive Domain Learning for Cross-domain Image Denoising,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94145,"Zian Qian, Chenyang Qi, Ka Law, Hao Fu, Chenyang Lei, Qifeng Chen","Different camera sensors have different noise patterns, and thus an image denoising model trained on one sensor often does not generalize well to a different sensor. One plausible solution is to collect a large dataset for each sensor for training or fine-tuning, which is inevitably time-consuming. To address this cross-domain challenge, we present a novel adaptive domain learning (ADL) scheme for cross-domain RAW image denoising by utilizing existing data from different sensors (source domain) plus a small amount of data from the new sensor (target domain). The ADL training scheme automatically removes the data in the source domain that are harmful to fine-tuning a model for the target domain (some data are harmful as adding them during training lowers the performance due to domain gaps). Also, we introduce a modulation module to adopt sensor-specific information (sensor type and ISO) to understand input data for image denoising. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets with various smartphone and DSLR cameras, which show our proposed model outperforms prior work on cross-domain image denoising, given a small amount of image data from the target domain sensor."
Poster,Adaptive Experimentation When You Can't Experiment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96795,"Yao Zhao, Kwang-Sung Jun, Tanner Fiez, Lalit Jain","This paper introduces the confounded pure exploration transductive linear bandit (CPET-LB) problem. As a motivating example,  often online services cannot directly assign users to specific control or treatment experiences either for business or practical reasons. In these settings, naively comparing treatment and control groups that may result from self-selection can lead to biased estimates of underlying treatment effects. Instead, online services can employ a properly randomized encouragement that incentivizes users toward a specific treatment. Our methodology provides online services with an adaptive experimental design approach for learning the best-performing treatment for such encouragement designs. We consider a more general underlying model captured by a linear structural equation and formulate pure exploration linear bandits in this setting. Though pure exploration has been extensively studied in standard adaptive experimental design settings, we believe this is the first work considering a setting where noise is confounded.  Elimination-style algorithms using experimental design methods in combination with a novel finite-time confidence interval on an instrumental variable style estimator are presented with sample complexity upper bounds nearly matching a minimax lower bound. Finally, experiments are conducted that demonstrate the efficacy of our approach."
Poster,Adaptive Exploration for Data-Efficient General Value Function Evaluations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95848,"Arushi Jain, Josiah Hanna, Doina Precup","General Value Functions (GVFs) (Sutton et al., 2011) represent predictive knowledge in reinforcement learning. Each GVF computes the expected return for a given policy, based on a unique reward. Existing methods relying on fixed behavior policies or pre-collected data often face data efficiency issues when learning multiple GVFs in parallel using off-policy methods. To address this, we introduce *GVFExplorer*, which adaptively learns a single behavior policy that efficiently collects data for evaluating multiple GVFs in parallel. Our method optimizes the behavior policy by minimizing the total variance in return across GVFs, thereby reducing the required environmental interactions. We use an existing temporal-difference-style variance estimator to approximate the return variance. We prove that each behavior policy update decreases the overall mean squared error in GVF predictions. We empirically show our method's performance in tabular and nonlinear function approximation settings, including Mujoco environments, with stationary and non-stationary reward signals, optimizing data usage and reducing prediction errors across multiple GVFs."
Poster,Adaptive Image Quality Assessment via Teaching Large Multimodal Model to Compare,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93763,"Hanwei Zhu, Haoning Wu, Yixuan Li, Zicheng Zhang, Baoliang Chen, Lingyu Zhu, Yuming Fang, Guangtao Zhai, Weisi Lin, Shiqi Wang","While recent advancements in large multimodal models (LMMs) have significantly improved their abilities in image quality assessment (IQA) relying on absolute quality rating, how to transfer reliable relative quality comparison outputs to continuous perceptual quality scores remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an all-around LMM-based NR-IQA model, which is capable of producing qualitatively comparative responses and effectively translating these discrete comparison outcomes into a continuous quality score. Specifically, during training, we present to generate scaled-up comparative instructions by comparing images from the same IQA dataset, allowing for more flexible integration of diverse IQA datasets. Utilizing the established large-scale training corpus, we develop a human-like visual quality comparator. During inference, moving beyond binary choices, we propose a soft comparison method that calculates the likelihood of the test image being preferred over multiple predefined anchor images. The quality score is further optimized by maximum a posteriori estimation with the resulting probability matrix. Extensive experiments on nine IQA datasets validate that the Compare2Score effectively bridges text-defined comparative levels during training with converted single image quality scores for inference, surpassing state-of-the-art IQA models across diverse scenarios. Moreover, we verify that the probability-matrix-based inference conversion not only improves the rating accuracy of Compare2Score but also zero-shot general-purpose LMMs, suggesting its intrinsic effectiveness."
Poster,Adaptive Important Region Selection with Reinforced Hierarchical Search for Dense Object Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94227,"Dingrong Wang, Hitesh Sapkota, Qi Yu","Existing state-of-the-art dense object detection techniques tend to produce a large number of false positive detections on difficult images with complex scenes because they focus on ensuring a high recall. To improve the detection accuracy, we propose an Adaptive Important Region Selection (AIRS) framework guided by Evidential Q-learning coupled with a uniquely designed reward function. Inspired by human visual attention, our detection model conducts object search in a top-down, hierarchical fashion. It starts from the top of the hierarchy with the coarsest granularity and then identifies the potential patches likely to contain objects of interest. It then discards non-informative patches and progressively moves downward on the selected ones for a fine-grained search. The proposed evidential Q-learning systematically encodes epistemic uncertainty in its evidential-Q value to encourage the exploration of unknown patches, especially in the early phase of model training. In this way, the proposed model dynamically balances exploration-exploitation to cover both highly valuable and informative patches. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the SOTA models."
Poster,AdaptiveISP: Learning an Adaptive Image Signal Processor for Object Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93538,"Yujin Wang, Tianyi Xu, Zhang Fan, Tianfan Xue, Jinwei Gu","Image Signal Processors (ISPs) convert raw sensor signals into digital images, which significantly influence the image quality and the performance of downstream computer vision tasks.     Designing ISP pipeline and tuning ISP parameters are two key steps for building an imaging and vision system.    To find optimal ISP configurations, recent works use deep neural networks as a proxy to search for ISP parameters or ISP pipelines. However, these methods are primarily designed to maximize the image quality, which are sub-optimal in the performance of high-level computer vision tasks such as detection, recognition, and tracking. Moreover, after training, the learned ISP pipelines are mostly fixed at the inference time, whose performance degrades in dynamic scenes.     To jointly optimize ISP structures and parameters, we propose AdaptiveISP, a task-driven and scene-adaptive ISP.     One key observation is that for the majority of input images, only a few processing modules are needed to improve the performance of downstream recognition tasks, and only a few inputs require more processing.    Based on this, AdaptiveISP utilizes deep reinforcement learning to automatically generate an optimal ISP pipeline and the associated ISP parameters to maximize the detection performance. Experimental results show that AdaptiveISP not only surpasses the prior state-of-the-art methods for object detection but also dynamically manages the trade-off between detection performance and computational cost, especially suitable for scenes with large dynamic range variations.Project website: https://openimaginglab.github.io/AdaptiveISP/."
Poster,Adaptive Labeling for Efficient Out-of-distribution Model Evaluation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93241,"Daksh Mittal, Yuanzhe Ma, Shalmali Joshi, Hongseok Namkoong","Datasets often suffer severe selection bias; clinical labels are only available on patients for whom doctors ordered medical exams. To assess model performance outside the support of available data, we present a computational framework for adaptive labeling, providing cost-efficient model evaluations under severe distribution shifts. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process over states defined by posterior beliefs on model performance. Each batch of new labels incurs a “state transition” to sharper beliefs, and we choose batches to minimize uncertainty on model performance at the end of the label collection process. Instead of relying on high-variance REINFORCE policy gradient estimators that do not scale, our adaptive labeling policy is optimized using path-wise policy gradients computed by auto-differentiating through simulated roll-outs. Our framework is agnostic to different uncertainty quantification approaches and highlights the virtue of planning in adaptive labeling. On synthetic and real datasets, we empirically demonstrate even a one-step lookahead policy substantially outperforms active learning-inspired heuristics."
Poster,Adaptive Layer Sparsity for Large Language Models via Activation Correlation Assessment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95693,"Wei Li, Lujun Li, Mark Lee, Shengjie Sun","Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing with their impressive capabilities. However, their enormous size presents challenges for deploying them in real-world applications. Traditional compression techniques, like pruning, often lead to suboptimal performance due to their uniform pruning ratios and lack of consideration for the varying importance of features across different layers. To address these limitations, we present a novel  Adaptive Layer Sparsity (ALS) approach to optimize LLMs. Our approach consists of two key steps. Firstly, we estimate the correlation matrix between intermediate layers by leveraging the concept of information orthogonality. This novel perspective allows for a precise measurement of the importance of each layer across the model. Secondly, we employ a linear optimization algorithm to develop an adaptive sparse allocation strategy based on evaluating the correlation matrix. This strategy enables us to selectively prune features in intermediate layers, achieving fine-grained optimization of the LLM model. Considering the varying importance across different layers, we can significantly reduce the model size without sacrificing performance. We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available language processing datasets, including the LLaMA-V1|V2|V3 family and OPT, covering various benchmarks. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our ALS method, showcasing its superiority over previous approaches. The performance gains demonstrate its potential for enhancing LLMs' efficiency and resource utilization. Notably, our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art models Wanda and SparseGPT, showcasing its ability to excel even under high sparsity levels.  Codes at: https://github.com/lliai/ALS."
Poster,Adaptive Passive-Aggressive Framework for Online Regression with Side Information,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93888,"Runhao Shi, Jiaxi Ying, Daniel Palomar","The Passive-Aggressive (PA) method is widely used in online regression problems for handling large-scale streaming data, typically updating model parameters in a passive-aggressive manner based on whether the error exceeds a predefined threshold. However, this approach struggles with determining optimal thresholds and adapting to complex scenarios with side information, where tracking accuracy is not the sole metric in the regression model. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel adaptive framework that allows finer adjustments to the weight vector in PA using side information. This framework adaptively selects the threshold parameter in PA, theoretically ensuring convergence to the optimal setting. Additionally, we present an efficient implementation of our algorithm that significantly reduces computational complexity. Numerical experiments show that our model achieves outstanding performance associated with the side information while maintaining low tracking error, demonstrating marked improvements over traditional PA methods across various scenarios."
