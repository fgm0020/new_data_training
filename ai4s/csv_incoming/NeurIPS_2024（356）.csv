Poster,Scaling Laws and Compute-Optimal Training Beyond Fixed Training Durations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94731,"Alex Hägele, Elie Bakouch, Atli Kosson, Loubna Ben allal, Leandro Von Werra, Martin Jaggi","Scale has become a main ingredient in obtaining strong machine learning models. As a result, understanding a model's scaling properties is key to effectively designing both the right training setup as well as future generations of architectures. In this work, we argue that scale and training research has been needlessly complex due to reliance on the cosine schedule, which prevents training across different lengths for the same model size. We investigate the training behavior of a direct alternative --- constant learning rate and cooldowns --- and find that it scales predictably and reliably similar to cosine. Additionally, we show that stochastic weight averaging yields improved performance along the training trajectory, without additional training costs, across different scales. Importantly, with these findings we demonstrate that scaling experiments can be performed with significantly reduced compute and GPU hours by utilizing fewer but reusable training runs. Our code is available at https://github.com/epfml/schedules-and-scaling/."
Poster,Scaling laws for learning with real and surrogate data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95461,"Ayush Jain, Andrea Montanari, Eren Sasoglu","Collecting large quantities of high-quality data can be  prohibitively expensive or impractical, and a bottleneck in machine learning. One may instead augment a small set of $n$ data points from the target distribution with data from more accessible sources, e.g. data collected under different circumstances or synthesized by generative models. We refer to such data  as `surrogate data'. We study a weighted empirical risk minimization (ERM) approach for integrating surrogate data into training. We analyze mathematically this method under several classical statistical models, and validate our findings empirically on datasets from different domains. Our main findings are: $(i)$ Integrating surrogate data can significantly reduce the test error on the original distribution. Surprisingly, this can happen even when the surrogate data is unrelated to the original ones. We trace back this behavior to the classical Stein's paradox. $(ii)$ In order to reap the benefit of surrogate data, it is crucial to use optimally weighted ERM. $(iii)$ The test error of models trained on mixtures of real and surrogate data is approximately described by a scaling law. This scaling law can be used to predict the optimal weighting scheme, and to choose the amount of surrogate data to add."
Poster,Scaling Laws for Reward Model Overoptimization in Direct Alignment Algorithms,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93540,"Rafael Rafailov, Yaswanth Chittepu, Ryan Park, Harshit Sushil Sikchi, Joey Hejna, Brad Knox, Chelsea Finn, Scott Niekum","Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)has been crucial to the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs), however it is often a complex and brittle process. In the classical RLHF framework, a reward model is first trained to represent human preferences, which is in turn used by an online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to optimized the LLM. A prominent issue with such methods is reward over-optimization or reward hacking, where the performance as measured by the learned proxy reward model increases, but the true model quality plateaus or even deteriorates. Direct Alignment Algorithms (DDAs), such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have emerged as alternatives to the classical RLHF pipeline. However, despite not training a separate proxy reward model or using RL, they still commonly deteriorate from over-optimization. While the so-called reward hacking phenomenon is not well-defined for DAAs, we still uncover similar trends: at higher KL-budgets, DAA algorithms exhibit similar degradation patters to their classic RLHF counterparts. In particular, we find that DAA methods deteriorate not only across a wide range of KL-budgets, but also often before even a single epoch of the dataset is completed. Through extensive empirical experimentation this work formulates the reward over-optimization or hacking problem for DAAs and explores its consequences across objectives, training regimes, and model scales."
Poster,"Scaling Laws in Linear Regression: Compute, Parameters, and Data",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95321,"Licong Lin, Jingfeng Wu, Sham Kakade, Peter Bartlett, Jason Lee","Empirically, large-scale deep learning models often satisfy a neural scaling law: the test error of the trained model improves polynomially as the model size and data size grow. However, conventional wisdom suggests the test error consists of approximation, bias, and variance errors, where the variance error increases with model size. This disagrees with the general form of neural scaling laws, which predict that increasing model size monotonically improves performance.We study the theory of scaling laws in an infinite dimensional linear regression setup. Specifically, we consider a model with $M$ parameters as a linear function of sketched covariates. The model is trained by one-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) using $N$ data. Assuming the optimal parameter satisfies a Gaussian prior and the data covariance matrix has a power-law spectrum of degree $a>1$, we show that the reducible part of the test error is $\Theta(M^{-(a-1)} + N^{-(a-1)/a})$. The variance error, which increases with $M$, is dominated by the other errors due to the implicit regularization of SGD, thus disappearing from the bound. Our theory is consistent with the empirical neural scaling laws and verified by numerical simulation."
Poster,Scaling Laws with Vocabulary: Larger Models Deserve Larger Vocabularies,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93395,"Chaofan Tao, Qian Liu, Longxu Dou, Niklas Muennighoff, Zhongwei Wan, Ping Luo, Min Lin, Ngai Wong","Research on scaling large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on model parameters and training data size, overlooking the role of vocabulary size. We investigate how vocabulary size impacts LLM scaling laws by training models ranging from 33M to 3B parameters on up to 500B characters with various vocabulary configurations. We propose three complementary approaches for predicting the compute-optimal vocabulary size: IsoFLOPs analysis, derivative estimation, and parametric fit of the loss function. Our approaches converge on the conclusion that the optimal vocabulary size depends on the compute budget, with larger models requiring larger vocabularies. Most LLMs, however, use insufficient vocabulary sizes. For example, we predict that the optimal vocabulary size of Llama2-70B should have been at least 216K, 7 times larger than its vocabulary of 32K. We validate our predictions empirically by training models with 3B parameters across different FLOPs budgets. Adopting our predicted optimal vocabulary size consistently improves downstream performance over commonly used vocabulary sizes. By increasing the vocabulary size from the conventional 32K to 43K, we improve performance on ARC-Challenge from 29.1 to 32.0 with the same 2.3e21 FLOPs.  Our work highlights the importance of jointly considering tokenization and model scaling for efficient pre-training.

Poster,Scaling Proprioceptive-Visual Learning with Heterogeneous Pre-trained Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95294,"Lirui Wang, Xinlei Chen, Jialiang Zhao, Kaiming He","One of the roadblocks for training generalist robotic models today is heterogeneity. Previous robot learning methods often collect data to train with one specific embodiment for one task, which is expensive and prone to overfitting. This work studies the problem of learning policy representations through heterogeneous pre-training on robot data across different embodiments and tasks at scale. We propose Heterogeneous Pre-trained Transformers (HPT), which pre-train a large, shareable trunk of a policy neural network to learn a task and embodiment agnostic shared representation. This general architecture aligns the specific proprioception and vision inputs from distinct embodiments to a short sequence of tokens and then processes such tokens to map to control robots for different tasks. Leveraging the recent large-scale multi-embodiment real-world robotic datasets as well as simulation, deployed robots, and human video datasets, we investigate pre-training policies across heterogeneity. We conduct experiments to investigate the scaling behaviors of training objectives, to the extent of 52 datasets. HPTs outperform several baselines and enhance the fine-tuned policy performance by over 20% on unseen tasks in multiple simulator benchmarks and real-world settings. See the project website (liruiw.github.io/hpt) for code and videos."
Poster,Scaling Retrieval-Based Language Models with a Trillion-Token Datastore,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94024,"Rulin Shao, Jacqueline He, Akari Asai, Weijia Shi, Tim Dettmers, Sewon Min, Luke Zettlemoyer, Pang Wei Koh","Scaling laws with respect to the amount of training data and the number of parameters allow us to predict the cost-benefit trade-offs of pretraining language models (LMs) in different configurations. In this paper, we consider another dimension of scaling: the amount of data available at inference time. Specifically, we find that increasing the size of the datastore used by a retrieval-based LM monotonically improves language modeling and several downstream tasks without obvious saturation, such that a smaller model augmented with a large datastore outperforms a larger LM-only model on knowledge-intensive tasks. By plotting compute-optimal scaling curves with varied datastore, model, and pretraining data sizes, we show that using larger datastores can significantly improve model performance for the same training compute budget. We carry out our study by constructing a 1.4 trillion-token datastore named MassiveDS, which is the largest and the most diverse open-sourced datastore for retrieval-based LMs to date, and designing an efficient pipeline for studying datastore scaling in an accessible manner. Finally, we analyze the effect of improving the retriever, datastore quality filtering, and other design choices on our observed scaling trends. Overall, our results show that datastore size should be considered as an integral part of LM efficiency and performance trade-offs. To facilitate future research, we open-source our datastore and code at https://github.com/RulinShao/retrieval-scaling."
Poster,Scaling Sign Language Translation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95543,"Biao Zhang, Garrett Tanzer, Orhan Firat","Sign language translation (SLT) addresses the problem of translating information from a sign language in video to a spoken language in text. Existing studies, while showing progress, are often limited to narrow domains and/or few sign languages and struggle with open-domain tasks. In this paper, we push forward the frontier of SLT by scaling pretraining data, model size, and number of translation directions. We perform large-scale SLT pretraining on different data including 1) noisy multilingual Youtube SLT data,2) parallel text corpora, and 3) SLT data augmented by translating video captions to other languages with off-the-shelf machine translation models. We unify different pretraining tasks with task-specific prompts under the encoder-decoder architecture, and initialize the SLT model with pretrained (m/By)T5 models across model sizes. SLT pretraining results on How2Sign and FLEURS-ASL\#0 (ASL to 42 spoken languages) demonstrate the significance of data/model scaling and cross-lingual cross-modal transfer, as well as the feasibility of zero-shot SLT. We finetune the pretrained SLT models on 5 downstream open-domain SLT benchmarks covering 5 sign languages. Experiments show substantial quality improvements over the vanilla baselines, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) by wide margins."
Poster,"Scaling the Codebook Size of VQ-GAN to 100,000 with a Utilization Rate of 99%",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95160,"Lei Zhu, Fangyun Wei, Yanye Lu, Dong Chen","In the realm of image quantization exemplified by VQGAN, the process encodes images into discrete tokens drawn from a codebook with a predefined size. Recent advancements, particularly with LLAMA 3, reveal that enlarging the codebook significantly enhances model performance. However, VQGAN and its derivatives, such as VQGAN-FC (Factorized Codes) and VQGAN-EMA, continue to grapple with challenges related to expanding the codebook size and enhancing codebook utilization. For instance, VQGAN-FC is restricted to learning a codebook with a maximum size of 16,384, maintaining a typically low utilization rate of less than 12% on ImageNet. In this work, we propose a novel image quantization model named VQGAN-LC (Large Codebook), which extends the codebook size to 100,000, achieving an utilization rate exceeding 99%. Unlike previous methods that optimize each codebook entry, our approach begins with a codebook initialized with 100,000 features extracted by a pre-trained vision encoder. Optimization then focuses on training a projector that aligns the entire codebook with the feature distributions of the encoder in VQGAN-LC. We demonstrate the superior performance of our model over its counterparts across a variety of tasks, including image reconstruction, image classification, auto-regressive image generation using GPT, and image creation with diffusion- and flow-based generative models."
Poster,Scaling transformer neural networks for skillful and reliable medium-range weather forecasting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94582,"Tung Nguyen, Rohan Shah, Hritik Bansal, Troy Arcomano, Romit Maulik, Rao Kotamarthi, Ian Foster, Sandeep Madireddy, Aditya Grover","Weather forecasting is a fundamental problem for anticipating and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recently, data-driven approaches for weather forecasting based on deep learning have shown great promise, achieving accuracies that are competitive with operational systems. However, those methods often employ complex, customized architectures without sufficient ablation analysis, making it difficult to understand what truly contributes to their success. Here we introduce Stormer, a simple transformer model that achieves state-of-the art performance on weather forecasting with minimal changes to the standard transformer backbone. We identify the key components of Stormer through careful empirical analyses, including weather-specific embedding, randomized dynamics forecast, and pressure-weighted loss. At the core of Stormer is a randomized forecasting objective that trains the model to forecast the weather dynamics over varying time intervals. During inference, this allows us to produce multiple forecasts for a target lead time and combine them to obtain better forecast accuracy. On WeatherBench 2, Stormer performs competitively at short to medium-range forecasts and outperforms current methods beyond 7 days, while requiring orders-of-magnitude less training data and compute. Additionally, we demonstrate Stormer’s favorable scaling properties, showing consistent improvements in forecast accuracy with increases in model size and training tokens. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/tung-nd/stormer."
