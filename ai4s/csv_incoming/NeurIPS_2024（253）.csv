Poster,Meteor: Mamba-based Traversal of Rationale for Large Language and Vision Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95711,"Byung-Kwan Lee, Chae Won Kim, Beomchan Park, Yong Man Ro","The rapid development of large language and vision models (LLVMs) has been driven by advances in visual instruction tuning. Recently, open-source LLVMs have curated high-quality visual instruction tuning datasets and utilized additional vision encoders or multiple computer vision models in order to narrow the performance gap with powerful closed-source LLVMs. These advancements are attributed to multifaceted information required for diverse capabilities, including fundamental image understanding, real-world knowledge about common-sense and non-object concepts (e.g., charts, diagrams, symbols, signs, and math problems), and step-by-step procedures for solving complex questions. Drawing from the multifaceted information, we present a new efficient LLVM, Mamba-based traversal of rationales (Meteor), which leverages multifaceted rationale to enhance understanding and answering capabilities. To embed lengthy rationales containing abundant information, we employ the Mamba architecture, capable of processing sequential data with linear time complexity. We introduce a new concept of traversal of rationale that facilitates efficient embedding of rationale. Subsequently, the backbone multimodal language model (MLM) is trained to generate answers with the aid of rationale. Through these steps, Meteor achieves significant improvements in vision language performances across multiple evaluation benchmarks requiring diverse capabilities, without scaling up the model size or employing additional vision encoders and computer vision models."
Poster,Metric Flow Matching for Smooth Interpolations on the Data Manifold,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94221,"Kacper Kapusniak, Peter Potaptchik, Teodora Reu, Leo Zhang, Alexander Tong, Michael Bronstein, Joey Bose, Francesco Di Giovanni","Matching objectives underpin the success of modern generative models and rely on constructing conditional paths that transform a source distribution into a target distribution. Despite being a fundamental building block, conditional paths have been designed principally under the assumption of $\textit{Euclidean geometry}$, resulting in straight interpolations. However, this can be particularly restrictive for tasks such as trajectory inference, where straight paths might lie outside the data manifold, thus failing to capture the underlying dynamics giving rise to the observed marginals. In this paper, we propose Metric Flow Matching (MFM), a novel simulation-free framework for conditional flow matching where interpolants are approximate geodesics learned by minimizing the kinetic energy of a data-induced Riemannian metric. This way, the generative model matches vector fields on the data manifold, which corresponds to lower uncertainty and more meaningful interpolations. We prescribe general metrics to instantiate MFM, independent of the task, and test it on a suite of challenging problems including LiDAR navigation, unpaired image translation, and modeling cellular dynamics. We observe that MFM outperforms the Euclidean baselines, particularly achieving SOTA on single-cell trajectory prediction."
Poster,Metric from Human: Zero-shot Monocular Metric Depth Estimation via Test-time Adaptation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95921,"Yizhou Zhao, Hengwei Bian, Kaihua Chen, Pengliang Ji, Liao Qu, Shao-yu Lin, Weichen Yu, Haoran Li, Hao Chen, Jun Shen, Bhiksha Raj, Min Xu","Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is fundamental for deriving 3D scene structures from 2D images. While state-of-the-art monocular relative depth estimation (MRDE) excels in estimating relative depths for in-the-wild images, current monocular metric depth estimation (MMDE) approaches still face challenges in handling unseen scenes. Since MMDE can be viewed as the composition of MRDE and metric scale recovery, we attribute this difficulty to scene dependency, where MMDE models rely on scenes observed during supervised training for predicting scene scales during inference. To address this issue, we propose to use humans as landmarks for distilling scene-independent metric scale priors from generative painting models. Our approach, Metric from Human (MfH), bridges from generalizable MRDE to zero-shot MMDE in a generate-and-estimate manner. Specifically, MfH generates humans on the input image with generative painting and estimates human dimensions with an off-the-shelf human mesh recovery (HMR) model. Based on MRDE predictions, it propagates the metric information from painted humans to the contexts, resulting in metric depth estimations for the original input. Through this annotation-free test-time adaptation, MfH achieves superior zero-shot performance in MMDE, demonstrating its strong generalization ability."
Poster,Metric Space Magnitude for Evaluating the Diversity of Latent Representations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94120,"Katharina Limbeck, Rayna Andreeva, Rik Sarkar, Bastian Rieck","The *magnitude* of a metric space is a novelinvariant that provides a measure of the 'effective size' of a space acrossmultiple scales, while also capturing numerous geometrical properties, such as curvature, density, or entropy.We develop a family of magnitude-based measures of the intrinsicdiversity of latent representations, formalising a novel notion ofdissimilarity between magnitude functions of finite metric spaces.Our measures are provably stable under perturbations of the data, can beefficiently calculated, and enable a rigorous multi-scale characterisation and comparison oflatent representations. We show their utility and superior performance across different domains and tasks, includingthe automated estimation of diversity,the detection of mode collapse, andthe evaluation of generative models for text, image, and graph data."
Poster,Metric Transforms and Low Rank Representations of Kernels for Fast Attention,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93915,"Timothy Chu, Josh Alman, Gary L. Miller, Shyam Narayanan, Mark Sellke, Zhao Song","We introduce a new linear-algebraic tool based on group representation theory, and use it to address three key problems in machine learning.1. Past researchers have proposed fast attention algorithms for LLMs by approximating or replace softmax attention with other functions, such as low-degree polynomials. The key property of these functions is that, when applied entry-wise to the matrix $QK^{\top}$, the result is a low rank matrix when $Q$ and $K$ are $n \times d$ matrices and $n \gg d$. This suggests a natural question: what are all functions $f$ with this property? If other $f$ exist and are quickly computable, they can be used in place of softmax for fast subquadratic attention algorithms. It was previously known that low-degree polynomials have this property. We prove that low-degree polynomials are the only piecewise continuous functions with this property. This suggests that the low-rank fast attention only works for functions approximable by polynomials. Our work gives a converse to the polynomial method in algorithm design.2. We prove the first full classification of all positive definite kernels that are functions of Manhattan or $\ell_1$ distance. Our work generalizes an existing theorem at the heart of all kernel methods in machine learning: the classification of all positive definite kernels that are functions of Euclidean distance. 3. The key problem in metric transforms, a mathematical theory used in geometry and machine learning, asks what functions transform pairwise distances in semi-metric space $M$ to semi-metric space $N$ for specified $M$ and $N$. We provide the first full classification of functions that transform Manhattan distances to Manhattan distances. Our work generalizes the foundational work of Schoenberg, which fully classifies functions that transform Euclidean to Euclidean distances. We additionally prove results about stable-rank preserving functions that are potentially useful in algorithmic design, and more. Our core new tool is called the representation theory of the hyperrectangle."
Poster,Metrizing Weak Convergence with Maximum Mean Discrepancies,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/98329,"Carl-Johann Simon-Gabriel, Alessandro Barp, Bernhard Schölkopf, Lester Mackey","This paper characterizes the maximum mean discrepancies (MMD) that metrize the weak convergence of probability measures for a wide class of kernels. More precisely, we prove that, on a locally compact, non-compact, Hausdorff space, the MMD of a bounded continuous Borel measurable kernel $k$, whose RKHS-functions vanish at infinity (i.e., $H_k \subset  C_0$), metrizes the weak convergence of probability measures if and only if $k$ is continuous and integrally strictly positive definite ($\int$s.p.d.) over all signed, finite, regular Borel measures. We also correct a prior result of Simon-Gabriel and Schölkopf (JMLR 2018, Thm. 12) by showing that there exist both bounded continuous $\int$s.p.d. kernels that do not metrize weak convergence and bounded continuous non-$\int$s.p.d. kernels that do metrize it."
Poster,MGF: Mixed Gaussian Flow for Diverse Trajectory Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93722,"Jiahe Chen, Jinkun Cao, Dahua Lin, Kris Kitani, Jiangmiao Pang","To predict future trajectories, the normalizing flow with a standard Gaussian prior suffers from weak diversity. The ineffectiveness comes from the conflict between the fact of asymmetric and multi-modal distribution of likely outcomes and symmetric and single-modal original distribution and supervision losses.Instead, we propose constructing a mixed Gaussian prior for a normalizing flow model for trajectory prediction.The prior is constructed by analyzing the trajectory patterns in the training samples without requiring extra annotations while showing better expressiveness and being multi-modal and asymmetric.Besides diversity, it also provides better controllability for probabilistic trajectory generation.We name our method Mixed Gaussian Flow (MGF). It achieves state-of-the-art performance in the evaluation of both trajectory alignment and diversity on the popular UCY/ETH and SDD datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/mulplue/MGF."
Poster,MG-Net: Learn to Customize QAOA with Circuit Depth Awareness,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96594,"Yang Qian, Xinbiao Wang, Yuxuan Du, Yong Luo, Dacheng Tao","Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and its variants exhibit immense potential in tackling combinatorial optimization challenges. However, their practical realization confronts a dilemma: the requisite circuit depth for satisfactory performance is problem-specific and often exceeds the maximum capability of current quantum devices. To address this dilemma, here we first analyze the convergence behavior of QAOA, uncovering the origins of this dilemma and elucidating the intricate relationship between the employed mixer Hamiltonian, the specific problem at hand, and the permissible maximum circuit depth. Harnessing this understanding, we introduce the Mixer Generator Network (MG-Net), a unified deep learning framework adept at dynamically formulating optimal mixer Hamiltonians tailored to distinct tasks and circuit depths. Systematic simulations, encompassing Ising models and weighted Max-Cut instances with up to 64 qubits, substantiate our theoretical findings, highlighting MG-Net's superior performance in terms of both approximation ratio and efficiency."
Poster,MicroAdam: Accurate Adaptive Optimization with Low Space Overhead and Provable Convergence,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95023,"Ionut-Vlad Modoranu, Mher Safaryan, Grigory Malinovsky, Eldar Kurtić, Thomas Robert, Peter Richtarik, Dan Alistarh","We propose a new variant of the Adam optimizer called MicroAdam that specifically minimizes memory overheads, while maintaining theoretical convergence guarantees. We achieve this by compressing the gradient information before it is fed into the optimizer state, thereby reducing its memory footprint significantly. We control the resulting compression  error via a novel instance of the classical *error feedback* mechanism from distributed optimization in which *the error correction information is itself compressed* to allow for practical memory gains. We prove that the resulting approach maintains theoretical convergence guarantees competitive to those of AMSGrad, while providing good practical performance. Specifically, we show that MicroAdam can be implemented efficiently on GPUs: on both million-scale (BERT) and billion-scale (LLaMA) models, MicroAdam provides practical convergence competitive to that of the uncompressed Adam baseline, with  lower memory usage and similar running time. Our code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/MicroAdam."
Poster,Micro-Bench: A Microscopy Benchmark for Vision-Language Understanding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97589,"Alejandro Lozano, Jeffrey Nirschl, James Burgess, Sanket Rajan Gupte, Yuhui Zhang, Alyssa Unell, Serena Yeung","Recent advances in microscopy have enabled the rapid generation of terabytes of image data in cell biology and biomedical research. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a promising solution for large-scale biological image analysis, enhancing researchers’ efficiency, identifying new image biomarkers, and accelerating hypothesis generation and scientific discovery. However, there is a lack of standardized, diverse, and large-scale vision-language benchmarks to evaluate VLMs’ perception and cognition capabilities in biological image understanding. To address this gap, we introduce Micro-Bench, an expert-curated benchmark encompassing 24 biomedical tasks across various scientific disciplines (biology, pathology), microscopy modalities (electron, fluorescence, light), scales (subcellular, cellular, tissue), and organisms in both normal and abnormal states. We evaluate state-of-the-art biomedical, pathology, and general VLMs on Micro-Bench and find that: i) current models struggle on all categories, even for basic tasks such as distinguishing microscopy modalities; ii) current specialist models fine-tuned on biomedical data often perform worse than generalist models; iii) fine-tuning in specific microscopy domains can cause catastrophic forgetting, eroding prior biomedical knowledge encoded in their base model. iv) weight interpolation between fine-tuned and pre-trained models offers one solution to forgetting and improves general performance across biomedical tasks. We release Micro-Bench under a permissive license to accelerate the research and development of microscopy foundation models."
