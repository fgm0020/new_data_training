Poster,VERIFIED: A Video Corpus Moment Retrieval Benchmark for Fine-Grained Video Understanding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97632,"Houlun Chen, Xin Wang, Hong Chen, Zeyang Zhang, Wei Feng, Bin Huang, Jia Jia, Wenwu Zhu","Existing Video Corpus Moment Retrieval (VCMR) is limited to coarse-grained understanding that hinders precise video moment localization when given fine-grained queries. In this paper, we propose a more challenging fine-grained VCMR benchmark requiring methods to localize the best-matched moment from the corpus with other partially matched candidates. To improve the dataset construction efficiency and guarantee high-quality data annotations, we propose VERIFIED, an automatic \underline{V}id\underline{E}o-text annotation pipeline to generate captions with \underline{R}el\underline{I}able \underline{FI}n\underline{E}-grained statics and \underline{D}ynamics. Specifically, we resort to large language models (LLM) and large multimodal models (LMM) with our proposed Statics and Dynamics Enhanced Captioning modules to generate diverse fine-grained captions for each video. To filter out the inaccurate annotations caused by the LLM hallucination, we propose a Fine-Granularity Aware Noise Evaluator where we fine-tune a video foundation model with disturbed hard-negatives augmented contrastive and matching losses. With VERIFIED, we construct a more challenging fine-grained VCMR benchmark containing Charades-FIG, DiDeMo-FIG, and ActivityNet-FIG which demonstrate a high level of annotation quality. We evaluate several state-of-the-art VCMR models on the proposed dataset, revealing that there is still significant scope for fine-grained video understanding in VCMR."
Poster,Verified Code Transpilation with LLMs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93370,"Sahil Bhatia, Jie Qiu, Niranjan Hasabnis, Sanjit Seshia, Alvin Cheung","Domain-specific languages (DSLs) have become integral to various software workflows. Such languages offer domain-specific optimizations and abstractions that improve code readability and maintainability.  However, leveraging these languages requires developers to rewrite existing code using the specific DSL's API. While large language models (LLMs) have shown some success in automatic code transpilation, none of them provide any functional correctness guarantees on the rewritten code. Another approach for automating this task is verified lifting, which relies on program synthesis to find programs in the target language that are functionally equivalent to the source language program. While several verified lifting tools have been developed for various application domains, they are specialized for specific source-target languages or require significant expertise in domain knowledge to make the search efficient. In this paper, leveraging recent advances in LLMs, we propose an LLM-based approach (LLMLift) to building verified lifting tools. We use the LLM's capabilities to reason about programs to translate a given program into its corresponding equivalent in the target language. Additionally, we use LLMs to generate proofs for functional equivalence. We develop lifting-based compilers for four DSLs targeting different application domains. Our approach not only outperforms previous symbolic-based tools in number of benchmarks transpiled and transpilation time, but also requires significantly less effort to build."
Poster,Verified Safe Reinforcement Learning  for Neural Network Dynamic Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93347,"Junlin Wu, Huan Zhang, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik","Learning reliably safe autonomous control is one of the core problems in trustworthy autonomy. However, training a controller that can be formally verified to be safe remains a major challenge. We introduce a novel approach for learning verified safe control policies in nonlinear neural dynamical systems while maximizing overall performance. Our approach aims to achieve safety in the sense of finite-horizon reachability proofs, and is comprised of three key parts. The first is a novel curriculum learning scheme that iteratively increases the verified safe horizon. The second leverages the iterative nature of gradient-based learning to leverage incremental verification, reusing information from prior verification runs. Finally, we learn multiple verified initial-state-dependent controllers, an idea that is especially valuable for more complex domains where learning a single universal verified safe controller is extremely challenging. Our experiments on five safe control problems demonstrate that our trained controllers can achieve verified safety over horizons that are as much as an order of magnitude longer than state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining high reward, as well as a perfect safety record over entire episodes. Our code is available at https://github.com/jlwu002/VSRL."
Poster,VeXKD: The Versatile Integration of Cross-Modal Fusion and Knowledge Distillation for 3D Perception,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95130,"JI Yuzhe, Yijie CHEN, Liuqing Yang, Ding Rui, Meng Yang, Xinhu Zheng","Recent advancements in 3D perception have led to a proliferation of network architectures, particularly those involving multi-modal fusion algorithms. While these fusion algorithms improve accuracy, their complexity often impedes real-time performance. This paper introduces VeXKD, an effective and Versatile framework that integrates Cross-Modal Fusion with Knowledge Distillation. VeXKD applies knowledge distillation exclusively to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature maps, enabling the transfer of cross-modal insights to single-modal students without additional inference time overhead. It avoids volatile components that can vary across various 3D perception tasks and student modalities, thus improving versatility. The framework adopts a modality-general cross-modal fusion module to bridge the modality gap between the multi-modal teachers and single-modal students. Furthermore, leveraging byproducts generated during fusion, our BEV query guided mask generation network identifies crucial spatial locations across different BEV feature maps in a data-driven manner, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate notable improvements, with up to 6.9\%/4.2\% increase in mAP and NDS for 3D detection tasks and up to 4.3\% rise in mIoU for BEV map segmentation tasks, narrowing the performance gap with multi-modal models."
Poster,VFIMamba: Video Frame Interpolation with State Space Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96629,"Guozhen Zhang, Chuxnu Liu, Yutao Cui, Xiaotong Zhao, Kai Ma, Limin Wang","Inter-frame modeling is pivotal in generating intermediate frames for video frame interpolation (VFI). Current approaches predominantly rely on convolution or attention-based models, which often either lack sufficient receptive fields or entail significant computational overheads. Recently, Selective State Space Models (S6) have emerged, tailored specifically for long sequence modeling, offering both linear complexity and data-dependent modeling capabilities. In this paper, we propose VFIMamba, a novel frame interpolation method for efficient and dynamic inter-frame modeling by harnessing the S6 model. Our approach introduces the Mixed-SSM Block (MSB), which initially rearranges tokens from adjacent frames in an interleaved fashion and subsequently applies multi-directional S6 modeling. This design facilitates the efficient transmission of information across frames while upholding linear complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a novel curriculum learning strategy that progressively cultivates proficiency in modeling inter-frame dynamics across varying motion magnitudes, fully unleashing the potential of the S6 model. Experimental findings showcase that our method attains state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks, particularly excelling in high-resolution scenarios. In particular, on the X-TEST dataset, VFIMamba demonstrates a noteworthy improvement of 0.80 dB for 4K frames and 0.96 dB for 2K frames."
Poster,VHELM: A Holistic Evaluation of Vision Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97677,"Tony Lee, Haoqin Tu, Chi Heem Wong, Wenhao Zheng, Yiyang Zhou, Yifan Mai, Josselin Roberts, Michihiro Yasunaga, Huaxiu Yao, Cihang Xie, Percy Liang","Current benchmarks for assessing vision-language models (VLMs) often focus on their perception or problem-solving capabilities and neglect other critical aspects such as fairness, multilinguality, or toxicity. Furthermore, they differ in their evaluation procedures and the scope of the evaluation, making it difficult to compare models. To address these issues, we extend the HELM framework to VLMs to present the Holistic Evaluation of Vision Language Models (VHELM). VHELM aggregates various datasets to cover one or more of the 9 aspects: *visual perception*, *knowledge*, *reasoning*, *bias*, *fairness*, *multilinguality*, *robustness*, *toxicity*, and *safety*. In doing so, we produce a comprehensive, multi-dimensional view of the capabilities of the VLMs across these important factors. In addition, we standardize the standard inference parameters, methods of prompting, and evaluation metrics to enable fair comparisons across models. Our framework is designed to be lightweight and automatic so that evaluation runs are cheap and fast. Our initial run evaluates 22 VLMs on 21 existing datasets to provide a holistic snapshot of the models. We uncover new key findings, such as the fact that efficiency-focused models (e.g., Claude 3 Haiku or Gemini 1.5 Flash) perform significantly worse than their full models (e.g., Claude 3 Opus or Gemini 1.5 Pro) on the bias benchmark but not when evaluated on the other aspects. For transparency, we release the raw model generations and complete results on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/vhelm/v2.0.1. VHELM is intended to be a living benchmark, and we hope to continue adding new datasets and models over time."
Poster,Video Diffusion Models are Training-free Motion Interpreter and Controller,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94604,"Zeqi Xiao, Yifan Zhou, Shuai Yang, Xingang Pan","Video generation primarily aims to model authentic and customized motion across frames, making understanding and controlling the motion a crucial topic. Most diffusion-based studies on video motion focus on motion customization with training-based paradigms, which, however, demands substantial training resources and necessitates retraining for diverse models. Crucially, these approaches do not explore how video diffusion models encode cross-frame motion information in their features, lacking interpretability and transparency in their effectiveness. To answer this question, this paper introduces a novel perspective to understand, localize, and manipulate motion-aware features in video diffusion models. Through analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), our work discloses that robust motion-aware feature already exists in video diffusion models. We present a new MOtion FeaTure (MOFT) by eliminating content correlation information and filtering motion channels. MOFT provides a distinct set of benefits, including the ability to encode comprehensive motion information with clear interpretability, extraction without the need for training, and generalizability across diverse architectures. Leveraging MOFT, we propose a novel training-free video motion control framework. Our method demonstrates competitive performance in generating natural and faithful motion, providing architecture-agnostic insights and applicability in a variety of downstream tasks."
Poster,VideoGUI: A Benchmark for GUI Automation from Instructional Videos,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97544,"Kevin Qinghong Lin, Linjie Li, Difei Gao, Qinchen WU, Mingyi Yan, Zhengyuan Yang, Lijuan Wang, Mike Zheng Shou","Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation holds significant promise for enhancing human productivity by assisting with computer tasks. Existing task formulations primarily focus on simple tasks that can be specified by a single, language-only instruction, such as “Insert a new slide.” In this work, we introduce VideoGUI, a novel multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate GUI assistants on visual-centric GUI tasks. Sourced from high-quality web instructional videos, our benchmark focuses on tasks involving professional and novel software (e.g., Adobe Pho- toshop or Stable Diffusion WebUI) and complex activities (e.g., video editing). VideoGUI evaluates GUI assistants through a hierarchical process, allowing for identification of the specific levels at which they may fail: (i) high-level planning: reconstruct procedural subtasks from visual conditions without language descrip- tions; (ii) middle-level planning: generate sequences of precise action narrations based on visual state (i.e., screenshot) and goals; (iii) atomic action execution: perform specific actions such as accurately clicking designated elements. For each level, we design evaluation metrics across individual dimensions to provide clear signals, such as individual performance in clicking, dragging, typing, and scrolling for atomic action execution. Our evaluation on VideoGUI reveals that even the SoTA large multimodal model GPT4o performs poorly on visual-centric GUI tasks, especially for high-level planning. The data and code are available at https://github.com/showlab/videogui."
Poster,VideoLLM-MoD: Efficient Video-Language Streaming with Mixture-of-Depths Vision Computation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95449,"Shiwei Wu, Joya Chen, Kevin Qinghong Lin, Qimeng Wang, Yan Gao, Qianli Xu, Tong Xu, Yao Hu, Enhong Chen, Mike Zheng Shou","A well-known dilemma in large vision-language models (e.g., GPT-4, LLaVA) is that while increasing the number of vision tokens generally enhances visual understanding, it also significantly raises memory and computational costs, especially in long-term, dense video frame streaming scenarios. Although learnable approaches like Q-Former and Perceiver Resampler have been developed to reduce the vision token burden, they overlook the context causally modeled by LLMs (i.e., key-value cache), potentially leading to missed visual cues when addressing user queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to reduce vision compute by leveraging redundant vision tokens ``skipping layers'' rather than decreasing the number of vision tokens. Our method, VideoLLM-MoD, is inspired by mixture-of-depths LLMs and addresses the challenge of numerous vision tokens in long-term or streaming video. Specifically, for certain transformer layer, we learn to skip the computation for a high proportion (e.g., 80\%) of vision tokens, passing them directly to the next layer. This approach significantly enhances model efficiency, achieving approximately 42% time and 30% memory savings for the entire training. Moreover, our method reduces the computation in the context and avoid decreasing the vision tokens, thus preserving or even improving performance compared to the vanilla model. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of VideoLLM-MoD, showing its state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including narration, forecasting, and summarization tasks in COIN, Ego4D, and Ego-Exo4D datasets. The code and checkpoints will be made available at github.com/showlab/VideoLLM-online."
Poster,VideoTetris: Towards Compositional Text-to-Video Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95173,"Ye Tian, Ling Yang, Haotian Yang, Yuan Gao, Yufan Deng, Xintao Wang, Zhaochen Yu, Xin Tao, Pengfei Wan, Di ZHANG, Bin CUI","Diffusion models have demonstrated great success in text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, existing methods may face challenges when handling complex (long) video generation scenarios that involve multiple objects or dynamic changes in object numbers. To address these limitations, we propose VideoTetris, a novel framework that enables compositional T2V generation. Specifically, we propose spatio-temporal compositional diffusion to precisely follow complex textual semantics by manipulating and composing the attention maps of denoising networks spatially and temporally. Moreover, we propose a new dynamic-aware data processing pipeline and a consistency regularization method to enhance the consistency of auto-regressive video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VideoTetris achieves impressive qualitative and quantitative results in compositional T2V generation.
