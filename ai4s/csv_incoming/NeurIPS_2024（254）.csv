Poster,Microstructures and Accuracy of Graph Recall by Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93339,"Yanbang Wang, Hejie Cui, Jon Kleinberg","Graphs data is crucial for many applications, and much of it exists in the relations described in textual format. As a result, being able to accurately recall and encode a graph described in earlier text is a basic yet pivotal ability that LLMs need to demonstrate if they are to perform reasoning tasks that involve graph-structured information. Human performance at graph recall by has been studied by cognitive scientists for decades, and has been found to often exhibit certain structural patterns of bias that align with human handling of social relationships. To date, however, we know little about how LLMs behave in analogous graph recall tasks: do their recalled graphs also exhibit certain biased patterns, and if so, how do they compare with humans and affect other graph reasoning tasks? In this work, we perform the first systematical study of graph recall by LLMs, investigating the accuracy and biased microstructures (local structural patterns) in their recall. We find that LLMs not only underperform often in graph recall, but also tend to favor more triangles and alternating 2-paths. Moreover, we find that more advanced LLMs have a striking dependence on the domain that a real-world graph comes from --- by yielding the best recall accuracy when the graph is narrated in a language style consistent with its original domain."
Poster,MIDGArD: Modular Interpretable Diffusion over Graphs for Articulated Designs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93424,"Quentin Leboutet, Nina Wiedemann, zhipeng cai, Michael Paulitsch, Kai Yuan","Providing functionality through articulation and interaction with objects is a key objective in 3D generation. We introduce MIDGArD (Modular Interpretable Diffusion over Graphs for Articulated Designs), a novel diffusion-based framework for articulated 3D asset generation. MIDGArD improves over foundational work in the field by enhancing quality, consistency, and controllability in the generation process. This is achieved through MIDGArD's modular approach that separates the problem into two primary components: structure generation and shape generation. The structure generation module of MIDGArD aims at producing coherent articulation features from noisy or incomplete inputs. It acts on the object's structural and kinematic attributes, represented as features of a graph that are being progressively denoised to issue coherent and interpretable articulation solutions. This denoised graph then serves as an advanced conditioning mechanism for the shape generation module, a 3D generative model that populates each link of the articulated structure with consistent 3D meshes. Experiments show the superiority of MIDGArD on the quality, consistency, and interpretability of the generated assets. Importantly, the generated models are fully simulatable, i.e., can be seamlessly integrated into standard physics engines such as MuJoCo, broadening MIDGArD's applicability to fields such as digital content creation, meta realities, and robotics."
Poster,MILP-StuDio: MILP Instance Generation via Block Structure Decomposition,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94857,"Haoyang Liu, Jie Wang, Wanbo Zhang, Zijie Geng, Yufei Kuang, Xijun Li, Bin Li, Yongdong Zhang, Feng Wu","Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is one of the most popular mathematical formulations with numerous applications. In practice, improving the performance of MILP solvers often requires a large amount of high-quality data, which can be challenging to collect. Researchers thus turn to generation techniques to generate additional MILP instances. However, existing approaches do not take into account specific block structures—which are closely related to the problem formulations—in the constraint coefficient matrices (CCMs) of MILPs. Consequently, they are prone to generate computationally trivial or infeasible instances due to the disruptions of block structures and thus problem formulations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel MILP generation framework, called Block Structure Decomposition (MILP-StuDio), to generate high-quality instances by preserving the block structures. Specifically, MILP-StuDio begins by identifying the blocks in CCMs and decomposing the instances into block units, which serve as the building blocks of MILP instances. We then design three operators to construct new instances by removing, substituting, and appending block units in the original instances, enabling us to generate instances with flexible sizes. An appealing feature of MILP-StuDio is its strong ability to preserve the feasibility and computational hardness of the generated instances. Experiments on the commonly-used benchmarks demonstrate that using instances generated by MILP-StuDio is able to significantly reduce over 10% of the solving time for learning-based solvers."
Poster,Mimicking To Dominate: Imitation Learning Strategies for Success in Multiagent Games,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96954,"The Viet Bui, Tien Mai, Thanh Nguyen","Training agents in multi-agent games presents significant challenges due to their intricate nature. These challenges are exacerbated by dynamics influenced not only by the environment but also by strategies of opponents. Existing methods often struggle with slow convergence and instability.To address these challenges, we harness the potential of imitation learning (IL) to comprehend and anticipate actions of the opponents, aiming to mitigate uncertainties with respect to the game dynamics.Our key contributions include:(i) a new multi-agent IL model for predicting next moves of the opponents - our model works with hidden actions of opponents and local observations;(ii) a new multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm that combines our IL model and policy training into one single training process;and (iii) extensive experiments in three challenging game environments, including an advanced version of the Star-Craft multi-agent challenge (i.e., SMACv2).Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art MARL algorithms."
Poster,MimicTalk: Mimicking a personalized and expressive 3D talking face in minutes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94126,"Zhenhui Ye, Tianyun Zhong, Yi Ren, Ziyue Jiang, Jiawei Huang, Rongjie Huang, Jinglin Liu, Jinzheng He, Chen Zhang, Zehan Wang, Xize Cheng, Xiang Yin, Zhou Zhao","Talking face generation (TFG) aims to animate a target identity's face to create realistic talking videos. Personalized TFG is a variant that emphasizes the perceptual identity similarity of the synthesized result (from the perspective of appearance and talking style). While previous works typically solve this problem by learning an individual neural radiance field (NeRF) for each identity to implicitly store its static and dynamic information, we find it inefficient and non-generalized due to the per-identity-per-training framework and the limited training data. To this end, we propose MimicTalk, the first attempt that exploits the rich knowledge from a NeRF-based person-agnostic generic model for improving the efficiency and robustness of personalized TFG. To be specific, (1) we first come up with a person-agnostic 3D TFG model as the base model and propose to adapt it into a specific identity; (2) we propose a static-dynamic-hybrid adaptation pipeline to help the model learn the personalized static appearance and facial dynamic features; (3) To generate the facial motion of the personalized talking style, we propose an in-context stylized audio-to-motion model that mimics the implicit talking style provided in the reference video without information loss by an explicit style representation. The adaptation process to an unseen identity can be performed in 15 minutes, which is 47 times faster than previous person-dependent methods. Experiments show that our MimicTalk surpasses previous baselines regarding video quality, efficiency, and expressiveness. Video samples are available at https://mimictalk.github.io ."
Poster,MindMerger: Efficiently Boosting LLM Reasoning in non-English Languages,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95346,"Zixian Huang, Wenhao Zhu, Gong Cheng, Lei Li, Fei Yuan","Reasoning capabilities are crucial for Large Language Models~(LLMs), yet a notable gap exists between English and non-English languages. To bridge this disparity, some works fine-tune LLMs to relearn reasoning capabilities in non-English languages, while others replace non-English inputs with an external model's outputs such as English translation text to circumvent the challenge of LLM understanding non-English. Unfortunately, these methods often underutilize the built-in skilled reasoning and useful language understanding capabilities of LLMs. In order to better utilize the minds of reasoning and language understanding in LLMs, we propose a new method, namely MergeMinds, which merges LLMs with the external language understanding capabilities from multilingual models to boost the multilingual reasoning performance. Furthermore, a two-step training scheme is introduced to first train to embeded the external capabilities into LLMs and then train the collaborative utilization of the external capabilities and the built-in capabilities in LLMs. Experiments on three multilingual reasoning datasets and a language understanding dataset demonstrate that MergeMinds consistently outperforms all baselines, especially in low-resource languages.  Without updating the parameters of LLMs, the average accuracy improved by 6.7 and 8.0 across all languages and low-resource languages on the MGSM dataset, respectively."
Poster,Mind's Eye of LLMs: Visualization-of-Thought Elicits Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96156,"Wenshan Wu, Shaoguang Mao, Yadong Zhang, Yan Xia, Li Dong, Lei Cui, Furu Wei","Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance in language comprehension and various reasoning tasks. However, their abilities in spatial reasoning, a crucial aspect of human cognition, remain relatively unexplored. Human possess a remarkable ability to create mental images of unseen objects and actions through a process known as the Mind's Eye, enabling the imagination of the unseen world. Inspired by this cognitive capacity, we propose Visualization-of-Thought (VoT) prompting. VoT aims to elicit spatial reasoning of LLMs by visualizing their reasoning traces, thereby guiding subsequent reasoning steps. We employed VoT for multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks, including natural language navigation, visual navigation, and visual tiling in 2D grid worlds. Experimental results demonstrated that VoT significantly enhances the spatial reasoning abilities of LLMs. Notably, VoT outperformed existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in these tasks. While VoT works surprisingly well on LLMs, the ability to generate mental images to facilitate spatial reasoning resembles the mind's eye process, suggesting its potential viability in MLLMs. Please find the dataset and codes in our [project page](https://microsoft.github.io/visualization-of-thought)."
Poster,Mind the Gap: A Causal Perspective on Bias Amplification in Prediction & Decision-Making,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94543,"Drago Plecko, Elias Bareinboim","As society increasingly relies on AI-based tools for decision-making in socially sensitive domains, investigating fairness and equity of such automated systems has become a critical field of inquiry. Most of the literature in fair machine learning focuses on defining and achieving fairness criteria in the context of prediction, while not explicitly focusing on how these predictions may be used later on in the pipeline. For instance, if commonly used criteria, such as independence or sufficiency, are satisfied for a prediction score $S$ used for binary classification, they need not be satisfied after an application of a simple thresholding operation on $S$ (as commonly used in practice). In this paper, we take an important step to address this issue in numerous statistical and causal notions of fairness. We introduce the notion of a margin complement, which measures how much a prediction score $S$ changes due to a thresholding operation.We then demonstrate that the marginal difference in the optimal 0/1 predictor $\widehat Y$ between groups, written $P(\hat y \mid x_1) - P(\hat y \mid x_0)$, can be causally decomposed into the influences of $X$ on the $L_2$-optimal prediction score $S$ and the influences of $X$ on the margin complement $M$, along different causal pathways (direct, indirect, spurious). We then show that under suitable causal assumptions, the influences of $X$ on the prediction score $S$ are equal to the influences of $X$ on the true outcome $Y$. This yields a new decomposition of the disparity in the predictor $\widehat Y$ that allows us to disentangle causal differences inherited from the true outcome $Y$ that exists in the real world vs. those coming from the optimization procedure itself. This observation highlights the need for more regulatory oversight due to the potential for bias amplification, and to address this issue we introduce new notions of weak and strong business necessity, together with an algorithm for assessing whether these notions are satisfied. We apply our method to three real-world datasets and derive new insights on bias amplification in prediction and decision-making."
Poster,Mind the Gap Between Prototypes and Images in Cross-domain Finetuning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95710,"Hongduan Tian, Feng Liu, Zhanke Zhou, Tongliang Liu, Chengqi Zhang, Bo Han","In _cross-domain few-shot classification_ (CFC), recent works mainly focus on adapting a simple transformation head on top of a frozen pre-trained backbone with few labeled data to project embeddings into a task-specific metric space where classification can be performed by measuring similarities between image instance and prototype representations. Technically, an _assumption_ implicitly adopted in such a framework is that the prototype and image instance embeddings share the same representation transformation. However, in this paper, we find that there naturally exists a gap, which resembles the modality gap, between the prototype and image instance embeddings extracted from the frozen pre-trained backbone, and simply applying the same transformation during the adaptation phase constrains exploring the optimal representation distributions and shrinks the gap between prototype and image representations. To solve this problem, we propose a simple yet effective method, _contrastive prototype-image adaptation_ (CoPA), to adapt different transformations for prototypes and images similarly to CLIP by treating prototypes as text prompts.   Extensive experiments on Meta-Dataset demonstrate that CoPA achieves the _state-of-the-art_ performance more efficiently. Meanwhile, further analyses also indicate that CoPA can learn better representation clusters, enlarge the gap, and achieve the minimum validation loss at the enlarged gap."
Poster,Mind the Graph When Balancing Data for Fairness or Robustness,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95592,"Jessica Schrouff, Alexis Bellot, Amal Rannen-Triki, Alan Malek, Isabela Albuquerque, Arthur Gretton, Alexander D&#x27;Amour, Silvia Chiappa","Failures of fairness or robustness in machine learning predictive settings can be due to undesired dependencies between covariates, outcomes and auxiliary factors of variation. A common strategy to mitigate these failures is data balancing, which attempts to remove those undesired dependencies. In this work, we define conditions on the training distribution for data balancing to lead to fair or robust models. Our results display that in many cases, the balanced distribution does not correspond to selectively removing the undesired dependencies in a causal graph of the task, leading to multiple failure modes and even interference with other mitigation techniques such as regularization. Overall, our results highlight the importance of taking the causal graph into account before performing data balancing."
