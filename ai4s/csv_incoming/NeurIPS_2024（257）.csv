Poster,MixEval: Deriving Wisdom of the Crowd from LLM Benchmark Mixtures,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96545,"Jinjie Ni, Fuzhao Xue, Xiang Yue, Yuntian Deng, Mahir Shah, Kabir Jain, Graham Neubig, Yang You","Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is challenging. Traditional ground-truth- based benchmarks fail to capture the comprehensiveness and nuance of real-world queries, while LLM-as-judge benchmarks suffer from grading biases and limited query quantity. Both of them may also become contaminated over time. User- facing evaluation, such as Chatbot Arena, provides reliable signals but is costly and slow. In this work, we propose MixEval, a new paradigm for establishing efficient, gold-standard LLM evaluation by strategically mixing off-the-shelf bench- marks. It bridges (1) comprehensive and well-distributed real-world user queries and (2) efficient and fairly-graded ground-truth-based benchmarks, by matching queries mined from the web with similar queries from existing benchmarks. Based on MixEval, we further build MixEval-Hard, which offers more room for model improvement. Our benchmarks’ advantages lie in (1) a 0.96 model ranking correlation with Chatbot Arena arising from the highly impartial query distribution and grading mechanism, (2) fast, cheap, and reproducible execution (6% of the time and cost of MMLU), and (3) dynamic evaluation enabled by the rapid and stable data update pipeline. We provide extensive meta-evaluation and analysis for our and existing LLM benchmarks to deepen the community’s understanding of LLM evaluation and guide future research directions."
Poster,Mixture of Adversarial LoRAs: Boosting Robust Generalization in Meta-Tuning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95797,"Xu Yang, Chen Liu, Ying Wei","This paper introduces AMT, an \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{M}eta-\textbf{T}uning methodology, to boost the robust generalization of pre-trained models in the out-of-domain (OOD) few-shot learning. To address the challenge of transferring knowledge from source domains to unseen target domains, we construct the robust LoRAPool by meta-tuning LoRAs with dual perturbations applied to not only the inputs but also singular values and vectors of the weight matrices at various robustness levels. On top of that, we introduce a simple yet effective test-time merging mechanism to dynamically merge discriminative LoRAs for test-time task customization. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AMT yields significant improvements, up to 12.92\% in clean generalization and up to 49.72\% in adversarial generalization, over previous state-of-the-art methods across a diverse range of OOD few-shot image classification tasks on three benchmarks, confirming the effectiveness of our approach to boost the robust generalization of pre-trained models.

Poster,Mixture of Demonstrations for In-Context Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93243,"Song Wang, Zihan Chen, Chengshuai Shi, Cong Shen, Jundong Li","In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle various tasks by providing input-output examples as additional inputs, referred to as demonstrations. Nevertheless, the performance of ICL could be easily impacted by the quality of selected demonstrations. Existing efforts generally learn a retriever model to score each demonstration for selecting suitable demonstrations, however, the effect is suboptimal due to the large search space and the noise from unhelpful demonstrations. In this study, we introduce MoD, which partitions the demonstration pool into groups, each governed by an expert to reduce search space. We further design an expert-wise training strategy to alleviate the impact of unhelpful demonstrations when optimizing the retriever model. During inference, experts collaboratively retrieve demonstrations for the input query to enhance the  ICL performance. We validate MoD via experiments across a range of NLP datasets and tasks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance and shedding new light on the future design of retrieval methods for ICL."
Poster,Mixture of Experts Meets Prompt-Based Continual Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94243,"Minh Le, An Nguyen The, Huy Nguyen, Trang Nguyen, Trang Pham, Linh Ngo, Nhat Ho","Exploiting the power of pre-trained models, prompt-based approaches stand out compared to other continual learning solutions in effectively preventing catastrophic forgetting, even with very few learnable parameters and without the need for a memory buffer. While existing prompt-based continual learning methods excel in leveraging prompts for state-of-the-art performance, they often lack a theoretical explanation for the effectiveness of prompting. This paper conducts a theoretical analysis to unravel how prompts bestow such advantages in continual learning, thus offering a new perspective on prompt design. We first show that the attention block of pre-trained models like Vision Transformers inherently encodes a special mixture of experts architecture, characterized by linear experts and quadratic gating score functions. This realization drives us to provide a novel view on prefix tuning, reframing it as the addition of new task-specific experts, thereby inspiring the design of a novel gating mechanism termed Non-linear Residual Gates (NoRGa). Through the incorporation of non-linear activation and residual connection, NoRGa enhances continual learning performance while preserving parameter efficiency. The effectiveness of NoRGa is substantiated both theoretically and empirically across diverse benchmarks and pretraining paradigms. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Minhchuyentoancbn/MoE_PromptCL."
Poster,Mixture of In-Context Experts Enhance LLMs' Long Context Awareness,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95158,"Hongzhan Lin, Ang Lv, yuhan chen, chen zhu, Yang Song, Hengshu Zhu, Rui Yan","Many studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) exhibit uneven awareness of different contextual positions. Their limited context awareness can lead to overlooking critical information and subsequent task failures. While several approaches have been proposed to enhance LLMs' context awareness, achieving both effectiveness and efficiency remains challenging. In this paper, for LLMs utilizing RoPE as position embeddings, we introduce a novel method called ""Mixture of In-Context Experts"" (MoICE) to address this challenge. MoICE comprises two key components: a router integrated into each attention head within LLMs and a lightweight router-only training optimization strategy:(1) MoICE views each RoPE angle as an 'in-context' expert, demonstrated to be capable of directing the attention of a head to specific contextual positions. Consequently, each attention head flexibly processes tokens using multiple RoPE angles dynamically selected by the router to attend to the needed positions. This approach mitigates the risk of overlooking essential contextual information. (2) The router-only training strategy entails freezing LLM parameters and exclusively updating routers for only a few steps. When applied to open-source LLMs including Llama and Mistral, MoICE surpasses prior methods across multiple tasks on long context understanding and generation, all while maintaining commendable inference efficiency."
Poster,Mixture of Link Predictors on Graphs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94794,"Li Ma, Haoyu Han, Juanhui Li, Harry Shomer, Hui Liu, Xiaofeng Gao, Jiliang Tang","Link prediction, which aims to forecast unseen connections in graphs, is a fundamental task in graph machine learning. Heuristic methods, leveraging a range of different pairwise measures such as common neighbors and shortest paths, often rival the performance of vanilla Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Therefore, recent advancements in GNNs for link prediction (GNN4LP) have primarily focused on integrating one or a few types of pairwise information. In this work,  we reveal that different node pairs within the same dataset necessitate varied pairwise information for accurate prediction and models that only apply the same pairwise information uniformly could achieve suboptimal performance.As a result, we propose a simple mixture of experts model Link-MoE for link prediction.  Link-MoE utilizes various GNNs as experts and  strategically selects the appropriate expert for each node pair based on various types of pairwise information. Experimental results across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate substantial performance improvement from Link-MoE. Notably,  Link-Mo achieves a relative improvement of 18.71% on the MRR metric for the Pubmed dataset and 9.59% on the Hits@100 metric for the ogbl-ppa dataset, compared to the best baselines.

Poster,Mixture of Nested Experts: Adaptive Processing of Visual Tokens,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95822,"Gagan Jain, Nidhi Hegde, Aditya Kusupati, Arsha Nagrani, Shyamal Buch, Prateek Jain, Anurag Arnab, Sujoy Paul","The visual medium (images and videos) naturally contains a large amount of information redundancy, thereby providing a great opportunity for leveraging efficiency in processing. While Vision Transformer (ViT) based models scale effectively to large data regimes, they fail to capitalize on this inherent redundancy, leading to higher computational costs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) networks demonstrate scalability while maintaining same inference-time costs, but they come with a larger parameter footprint. We present Mixture of Nested Experts (MoNE), which utilizes a nested structure for experts, wherein individual experts fall on an increasing compute-accuracy curve. Given a compute budget, MoNE learns to dynamically choose tokens in a priority order, and thus redundant tokens are processed through cheaper nested experts. Using this framework, we achieve equivalent performance as the baseline models, while reducing inference time compute by over two-fold. We validate our approach on standard image and video datasets - ImageNet-21K, Kinetics400, and Something-Something-v2. We further highlight MoNE's adaptability by showcasing its ability to maintain strong performance across different inference-time compute budgets on videos, using only a single trained model."
Poster,Mixture of neural fields for heterogeneous reconstruction in cryo-EM,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95007,"Axel Levy, Rishwanth Raghu, David Shustin, Adele Peng, Huan Li, Oliver Clarke, Gordon Wetzstein, Ellen Zhong","Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an experimental technique for protein structure determination that images an ensemble of macromolecules in near-physiological contexts. While recent advances enable the reconstruction of dynamic conformations of a single biomolecular complex, current methods do not adequately model samples with mixed conformational and compositional heterogeneity. In particular, datasets containing mixtures of multiple proteins require the joint inference of structure, pose, compositional class, and conformational states for 3D reconstruction. Here, we present Hydra, an approach that models both conformational and compositional heterogeneity fully ab initio by parameterizing structures as arising from one of K neural fields. We employ a hybrid optimization strategy and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic datasets composed of mixtures of proteins with large degrees of conformational variability. We additionally demonstrate Hydra on an experimental dataset imaged of a cellular lysate containing a mixture of different protein complexes. Hydra expands the expressivity of heterogeneous reconstruction methods and thus broadens the scope of cryo-EM to increasingly complex samples."
Poster,Mixture of Scales: Memory-Efficient Token-Adaptive Binarization for Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93569,"Dongwon Jo, Taesu Kim, Yulhwa Kim, jae-joon kim","Binarization, which converts weight parameters to binary values, has emerged as an effective strategy to reduce the size of large language models (LLMs). However, typical binarization techniques significantly diminish linguistic effectiveness of LLMs.To address this issue, we introduce a novel binarization technique called Mixture of Scales (BinaryMoS). Unlike conventional methods, BinaryMoS employs multiple scaling experts for binary weights, dynamically merging these experts for each token to adaptively generate scaling factors. This token-adaptive approach boosts the representational power of binarized LLMs by enabling contextual adjustments to the values of binary weights. Moreover, because this adaptive process only involves the scaling factors rather than the entire weight matrix, BinaryMoS maintains compression efficiency similar to traditional static binarization methods. Our experimental results reveal that BinaryMoS surpasses conventional binarization techniques in various natural language processing tasks and even outperforms 2-bit quantization methods, all while maintaining similar model size to static binarization techniques."
Poster,Mixture of Tokens: Continuous MoE through Cross-Example Aggregation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96896,"Szymon Antoniak, Michał Krutul, Maciej Pióro, Jakub Krajewski, Jan Ludziejewski, Kamil Ciebiera, Krystian Król, Tomasz Odrzygóźdź, Marek Cygan, Sebastian Jaszczur","Mixture of Experts (MoE) models based on Transformer architecture are pushing the boundaries of language and vision tasks. The allure of these models lies in their ability to substantially increase the parameter count without a corresponding increase in FLOPs. Most widely adopted MoE models are discontinuous with respect to their parameters - often referred to as *sparse*. At the same time, existing continuous MoE designs either lag behind their sparse counterparts or are incompatible with autoregressive decoding. Motivated by the observation that the adaptation of fully continuous methods has been an overarching trend in Deep Learning, we develop Mixture of Tokens (MoT), a simple, continuous architecture that is capable of scaling the number of parameters similarly to sparse MoE models. Unlike conventional methods, MoT assigns mixtures of tokens from different examples to each expert. This architecture is fully compatible with autoregressive training and generation. Our best models not only achieve a 3x increase in training speed over dense Transformer models in language pretraining but also match the performance of state-of-the-art MoE architectures. Additionally, a close connection between MoT and MoE is demonstrated through a novel technique we call *transition tuning*."
