Poster,Counterfactual Fairness by Combining Factual and Counterfactual Predictions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95743,"Zeyu Zhou, Tianci Liu, Ruqi Bai, Jing Gao, Murat Kocaoglu, David Inouye","In high-stakes domains such as healthcare and hiring, the role of machine learning (ML) in decision-making raises significant fairness concerns. This work focuses on Counterfactual Fairness (CF), which posits that an ML model's outcome on any individual should remain unchanged if they had belonged to a different demographic group.Previous works have proposed methods that guarantee CF. Notwithstanding, their effects on the model's predictive performance remain largely unclear.To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical study on the inherent trade-off between CF and predictive performance in a model-agnostic manner. We first propose a simple but effective method to cast an optimal but potentially unfair predictor into a fair one with a minimal loss of performance.By analyzing the excess risk incurred by perfect CF, we quantify this inherent trade-off. Further analysis on our method's performance with access to only incomplete causal knowledge is also conducted. Built upon this, we propose a practical algorithm that can be applied in such scenarios. Experiments on both synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the validity of our analysis and methods."
Poster,CountGD: Multi-Modal Open-World Counting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94265,"Niki Amini-Naieni, Tengda Han, Andrew Zisserman","The goal of this paper is to improve the generality and accuracy of open-vocabulary object counting in images. To improve the generality, we repurpose an open-vocabulary detection foundation model (GroundingDINO) for the counting task, and also extend its capabilities by introducing modules to enable specifying the target object to count by visual exemplars. In turn, these new capabilities -- being able to specify the target object by multi-modalites (text and exemplars) -- lead to an improvement in counting accuracy. We make three contributions: First, we introduce the first open-world counting model, CountGD,  where the prompt can be specified by a text description or visual exemplars or both; Second, we show that the performance of the model significantly improves the state of the art on multiple counting benchmarks -- when using text only, CountGD outperforms all previous text-only works, and when using both text and visual exemplars, we outperform all previous models; Third, we carry out a preliminary study into different interactions between the text and visual exemplar prompts, including the cases where they reinforce each other and where one restricts the other. The code and an app to test the model are available at https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/vgg/research/countgd/."
Poster,Coupled Mamba: Enhanced Multimodal Fusion with Coupled State Space Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94962,"Wenbing Li, Hang Zhou, Junqing Yu, Zikai Song, Wei Yang","The essence of multi-modal fusion lies in exploiting the complementary information inherent in diverse modalities.However, most prevalent fusion methods rely on traditional neural architectures and are inadequately equipped to capture the dynamics of interactions across modalities, particularly in presence of complex intra- and inter-modality correlations.Recent advancements in State Space Models (SSMs), notably exemplified by the Mamba model, have emerged as promising contenders. Particularly, its state evolving process implies stronger modality fusion paradigm, making multi-modal fusion on SSMs an appealing direction. However, fusing multiple modalities is challenging for SSMs due to its hardware-aware parallelism designs. To this end, this paper proposes the Coupled SSM model, for coupling state chains of multiple modalities while maintaining independence of intra-modality state processes. Specifically, in our coupled scheme, we devise an inter-modal hidden states transition scheme, in which the current state is dependent on the states of its own chain and that of the neighbouring chains at the previous time-step. To fully comply with the hardware-aware parallelism, we obtain the global convolution kernel by deriving the state equation while introducing the historical state.Extensive experiments on CMU-MOSEI, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMSV2 through multi-domain input verify the effectiveness of our model compared to current state-of-the-art methods, improved F1-Score by 0.4%, 0.9%, and 2.3% on the three datasets respectively, 49% faster inference and 83.7% GPU memory save. The results demonstrate that Coupled Mamba model is capable of enhanced multi-modal fusion."
Poster,Covariate Shift Corrected Conditional Randomization Test,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95502,"Bowen Xu, Yiwen Huang, Chuan Hong, Shuangning Li, Molei Liu","Conditional independence tests are crucial across various disciplines in determining the independence of an outcome variable $Y$ from a treatment variable $X$, conditioning on a set of confounders $Z$. The Conditional Randomization Test (CRT) offers a powerful framework for such testing by assuming known distributions of $X \mid Z$; it controls the Type-I error exactly, allowing for the use of flexible, black-box test statistics. In practice, testing for conditional independence often involves using data from a source population to draw conclusions about a target population. This can be challenging due to covariate shift---differences in the distribution of $X$, $Z$, and surrogate variables, which can affect the conditional distribution of $Y \mid X, Z$---rendering traditional CRT approaches invalid. To address this issue, we propose a novel Covariate Shift Corrected Pearson Chi-squared Conditional Randomization (csPCR) test. This test adapts to covariate shifts by integrating importance weights and employing the control variates method to reduce variance in the test statistics and thus enhance power. Theoretically, we establish that the csPCR test controls the Type-I error asymptotically. Empirically, through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our method not only maintains control over Type-I errors but also exhibits superior power, confirming its efficacy and practical utility in real-world scenarios where covariate shifts are prevalent. Finally, we apply our methodology to a real-world dataset to assess the impact of a COVID-19 treatment on the 90-day mortality rate among patients."
Poster,COVE: Unleashing the Diffusion Feature Correspondence for Consistent Video Editing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96694,"Jiangshan Wang, Yue Ma, Jiayi Guo, Yicheng Xiao, Gao Huang, Xiu Li","Video editing is an emerging task, in which most current methods adopt the pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model to edit the source video in a zero-shot manner. Despite extensive efforts, maintaining the temporal consistency of edited videos remains challenging due to the lack of temporal constraints in the regular T2I diffusion model. To address this issue, we propose COrrespondence-guided Video Editing (COVE), leveraging the inherent diffusion feature correspondence to achieve high-quality and consistent video editing. Specifically, we propose an efficient sliding-window-based strategy to calculate the similarity among tokens in the diffusion features of source videos, identifying the tokens with high correspondence across frames. During the inversion and denoising process, we sample the tokens in noisy latent based on the correspondence and then perform self-attention within them. To save the usage of GPU memory and accelerate the editing process, we further introduce the temporal-dimensional token merging strategy, which can effectively reduce the redundancy. COVE can be seamlessly integrated into the pre-trained T2I diffusion model without the need for extra training or optimization. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that COVE achieves the start-of-the-art performance in various video editing scenarios, outperforming existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. The source code will be released."
Poster,CoVoMix: Advancing Zero-Shot Speech Generation for Human-like Multi-talker Conversations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94904,"Leying Zhang, Yao Qian, Long Zhou, Shujie LIU, Dongmei Wang, Xiaofei Wang, Midia Yousefi, Yanmin Qian, Jinyu Li, Lei He, sheng zhao, Michael Zeng","Recent advancements in zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) modeling have led to significant strides in generating high-fidelity and diverse speech. However, dialogue generation, along with achieving human-like naturalness in speech, continues to be a challenge. In this paper, we introduce CoVoMix: Conversational Voice Mixture Generation, a novel model for zero-shot, human-like, multi-speaker, multi-round dialogue speech generation. CoVoMix first converts dialogue text into multiple streams of discrete tokens, with each token stream representing semantic information for individual talkers. These token streams are then fed into a flow-matching based acoustic model to generate mixed mel-spectrograms. Finally, the speech waveforms are produced using a HiFi-GAN model. Furthermore, we devise a comprehensive set of metrics for measuring the effectiveness of dialogue modeling and generation. Our experimental results show that CoVoMix can generate dialogues that are not only human-like in their naturalness and coherence but also involve multiple talkers engaging in multiple rounds of conversation. This is exemplified by instances generated in a single channel where one speaker's utterance is seamlessly mixed with another's interjections or laughter, indicating the latter's role as an attentive listener. Audio samples are enclosed in the supplementary."
Poster,cPAPERS: A Dataset of Situated and Multimodal Interactive Conversations in Scientific Papers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97802,"Anirudh Sundar, Jin Xu, William Gay, Christopher Richardson, Larry Heck","An emerging area of research in situated and multimodal interactive conversations (SIMMC) includes interactions in scientific papers. Since scientific papers are primarily composed of text, equations, figures, and tables, SIMMC methods must be developed specifically for each component to support the depth of inquiry and interactions required by research scientists.      This work introduces $Conversational Papers$ (cPAPERS), a dataset of conversational question-answer pairs from reviews of academic papers grounded in these paper components and their associated references from scientific documents available on arXiv. We present a data collection strategy to collect these question-answer pairs from OpenReview and associate them with contextual information from $LaTeX$ source files. Additionally, we present a series of baseline approaches utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) in both zero-shot and fine-tuned configurations to address the cPAPERS dataset."
Poster,Cracking the Code of Juxtaposition: Can AI Models Understand the Humorous Contradictions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94508,"Zhe Hu, Tuo Liang, Jing Li, Yiren Lu, Yunlai Zhou, Yiran Qiao, Jing Ma, Yu Yin","Recent advancements in large vision language models have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across a wide range of tasks. Yet, these models still struggle with understanding the nuances of human humor through juxtaposition, particularly when it involves nonlinear narratives that underpin many jokes and humor cues.  This paper investigates this challenge by focusing on comics with contradictory narratives, where each comic consists of two panels that create a humorous contradiction. We introduce the YesBut benchmark, which comprises tasks of varying difficulty aimed at assessing AI's capabilities in recognizing and interpreting these comics, ranging from literal content comprehension to deep narrative reasoning. Through extensive experimentation and analysis of recent commercial or open-sourced large vision language models, we assess their capability to comprehend the complex interplay of the narrative humor inherent in these comics. Our results show that even the state-of-the-art models still struggle with this task. Our findings offer insights into the current limitations and potential improvements for AI in understanding human creative expressions."
Poster,Crafting Interpretable Embeddings for Language Neuroscience by Asking LLMs Questions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93720,"Vinamra Benara, Chandan Singh, John Morris, Richard Antonello, Ion Stoica, Alexander Huth, Jianfeng Gao","Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly improved text embeddings for a growing array of natural-language processing tasks. However, their opaqueness and proliferation into scientific domains such as neuroscience have created a growing need for interpretability. Here, we ask whether we can obtain interpretable embeddings through LLM prompting. We introduce question-answering embeddings (QA-Emb), embeddings where each feature represents an answer to a yes/no question asked to an LLM. Training QA-Emb reduces to selecting a set of underlying questions rather than learning model weights.We use QA-Emb to flexibly generate interpretable models for predicting fMRI voxel responses to language stimuli. QA-Emb significantly outperforms an established interpretable baseline, and does so while requiring very few questions. This paves the way towards building flexible feature spaces that can concretize and evaluate our understanding of semantic brain representations. We additionally find that QA-Emb can be effectively approximated with an efficient model, and we explore broader applications in simple NLP tasks."
Poster,CRAG - Comprehensive RAG Benchmark,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97703,"Xiao Yang, Kai Sun, Hao Xin, Yushi Sun, Nikita Bhalla, Xiangsen Chen, Sajal Choudhary, Rongze Gui, Ziran Jiang, Ziyu Jiang, Lingkun Kong, Brian Moran, Jiaqi Wang, Yifan Xu, An Yan, Chenyu Yang, Eting Yuan, Hanwen Zha, Nan Tang, Lei Chen, Nicolas Scheffer, Yue Liu, Nirav Shah, Rakesh Wanga, Anuj Kumar, Scott Yih, Xin Dong","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently emerged as a promising solution to alleviate Large Language Model (LLM)’s deficiency in lack of knowledge. Existing RAG datasets, however, do not adequately represent the diverse and dynamic nature of real-world Question Answering (QA) tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Comprehensive RAG Benchmark (CRAG), a factual question answering benchmark of 4,409 question-answer pairs and mock APIs to simulate web and Knowledge Graph (KG) search. CRAG is designed to encapsulate a diverse array of questions across five domains and eight question categories, reflecting varied entity popularity from popular to long-tail, and temporal dynamisms ranging from years to seconds. Our evaluation on this benchmark highlights the gap to fully trustworthy QA. Whereas most advanced LLMs achieve $\le 34\%$ accuracy on CRAG, adding RAG in a straightforward manner improves the accuracy only to 44%. State-of-the-art industry RAG solutions only answer 63% questions without any hallucination. CRAG also reveals much lower accuracy in answering questions regarding facts with higher dynamism, lower popularity, or higher complexity, suggesting future research directions. The CRAG benchmark laid the groundwork for a KDD Cup 2024 challenge, attracted thousands of participants and submissions. We commit to maintaining CRAG to serve research communities in advancing RAG solutions and general QA solutions. CRAG is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/CRAG/."
