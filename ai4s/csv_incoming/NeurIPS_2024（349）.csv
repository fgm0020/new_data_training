Poster,Robustly overfitting latents for flexible neural image compression,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95439,"Yura Perugachi Diaz, Arwin Gansekoele, Sandjai Bhulai","Neural image compression has made a great deal of progress. State-of-the-art models are based on variational autoencoders and are outperforming classical models. Neural compression models learn to encode an image into a quantized latent representation that can be efficiently sent to the decoder, which decodes the quantized latent into a reconstructed image. While these models have proven successful in practice, they lead to sub-optimal results due to imperfect optimization and limitations in the encoder and decoder capacity. Recent work shows how to use stochastic Gumbel annealing (SGA) to refine the latents of pre-trained neural image compression models. We extend this idea by introducing SGA+, which contains three different methods that build upon SGA.We show how our method improves the overall compression performance in terms of the R-D trade-off, compared to its predecessors. Additionally, we show how refinement of the latents with our best-performing method improves the compression performance on both the Tecnick and CLIC dataset. Our method is deployed for a pre-trained hyperprior and for a more flexible model.Further, we give a detailed analysis of our proposed methods and show that they are less sensitive to hyperparameter choices. Finally, we show how each method can be extended to three- instead of two-class rounding."
Poster,Robust Mixture Learning when Outliers Overwhelm Small Groups,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95012,"Daniil Dmitriev, Rares-Darius Buhai, Stefan Tiegel, Alexander Wolters, Gleb Novikov, Amartya Sanyal, David Steurer, Fanny Yang","We study the problem of estimating the means of well-separated mixtures when an adversary may add arbitrary outliers. While strong guarantees are available when the outlier fraction is significantly smaller than the minimum mixing weight, much less is known when outliers may crowd out low-weight clusters – a setting we refer to as list-decodable mixture learning (LD-ML). In this case, adversarial outliers can simulate additional spurious mixture components. Hence, if all means of the mixture must be recovered up to a small error in the output list, the list size needs to be larger than the number of (true) components. We propose an algorithm that obtains order-optimal error guarantees for each mixture mean with a minimal list-size overhead, significantly improving upon list-decodable mean estimation, the only existing method that is applicable for LD-ML. Although improvements are observed even when the mixture is non-separated, our algorithm achieves particularly strong guarantees when the mixture is separated: it can leverage the mixture structure to partially cluster the samples before carefully iterating a base learner for list-decodable mean estimation at different scales."
Poster,Robust Neural Contextual Bandit against Adversarial Corruptions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96522,"Yunzhe Qi, Yikun Ban, Arindam Banerjee, Jingrui He","Contextual bandit algorithms aim to identify the optimal arm with the highest reward among a set of candidates, based on the accessible contextual information. Among these algorithms, neural contextual bandit methods have shown generally superior performances against linear and kernel ones, due to the representation power of neural networks. However, similar to other neural network applications, neural bandit algorithms can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks or corruptions on the received labels (i.e., arm rewards), which can lead to unexpected performance degradation without proper treatments. As a result, it is necessary to improve the robustness of neural bandit models against potential reward corruptions. In this work, we propose a novel neural contextual bandit algorithm named R-NeuralUCB, which utilizes a novel context-aware Gradient Descent (GD) training strategy to improve the robustness against adversarial reward corruptions. Under over-parameterized neural network settings, we provide regret analysis for R-NeuralUCB to quantify  reward corruption impacts, without the commonly adopted arm separateness assumption in existing neural bandit works. We also conduct experiments against baselines on real data sets under different scenarios, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed R-NeuralUCB."
Poster,Robust Offline Active Learning on Graphs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95537,"Yuanchen Wu, Yubai Yuan","We consider the problem of active learning on graphs for node-level tasks, which has crucial applications in many real-world networks where labeling node responses is expensive. In this paper, we propose an offline active learning method that selects nodes to query by explicitly incorporating information from both the network structure and node covariates. Building on graph signal recovery theories and the random spectral sparsification technique, the proposed method adopts a two-stage biased sampling strategy that takes both informativeness and representativeness into consideration for node querying. Informativeness refers to the complexity of graph signals that are learnable from the responses of queried nodes, while representativeness refers to the capacity of queried nodes to control generalization errors given noisy node-level information. We establish a theoretical relationship between generalization error and the number of nodes selected by the proposed method. Our theoretical results demonstrate the trade-off between Informativeness and representativeness in active learning. Extensive numerical experiments show that the proposed method is competitive with existing graph-based active learning methods, especially when node covariates and responses contain noises. Additionally, the proposed method is applicable to both regression and classification tasks on graphs."
Poster,Robust Prompt Optimization for Defending Language Models Against Jailbreaking Attacks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93953,"Andy Zhou, Bo Li, Haohan Wang","Despite advances in AI alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks or jailbreaking, in which adversaries can modify prompts to induce unwanted behavior. While some defenses have been proposed, they have not been adapted to newly proposed attacks and more challenging threat models. To address this, we propose an optimization-based objective for defending LLMs against jailbreaking attacks and an algorithm, Robust Prompt Optimization (RPO), to create robust system-level defenses. Our approach directly incorporates the adversary into the defensive objective and optimizes a lightweight and transferable suffix, enabling RPO to adapt to worst-case adaptive attacks. Our theoretical and experimental results show improved robustness to both jailbreaks seen during optimization and unknown jailbreaks, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4 to 6% and Llama-2 to 0% on JailbreakBench, setting the state-of-the-art."
Poster,Robust Reinforcement Learning from Corrupted Human Feedback,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94419,"Alexander Bukharin, Ilgee Hong, Haoming Jiang, Zichong Li, Qingru Zhang, Zixuan Zhang, Tuo Zhao","Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) provides a principled framework for aligning AI systems with human preference data. For various reasons, e.g., personal bias, context ambiguity, lack of training, etc, human annotators may give incorrect or inconsistent preference labels.  To tackle this challenge, we propose a robust RLHF approach -- $R^3M$, which models the potentially corrupted preference label as sparse outliers. Accordingly, we formulate the robust reward learning as an $\ell_1$-regularized maximum likelihood estimation problem. Computationally, we develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm, which only incurs negligible computational overhead compared with the standard RLHF approach. Theoretically, we prove that under proper regularity conditions, $R^3M$ can consistently learn the underlying reward and identify outliers, provided that the number of outlier labels scales sublinearly with the preference sample size. Furthermore, we remark that $R^3M$ is versatile and can be extended to various preference optimization methods, including direct preference optimization (DPO). Our experiments on robotic control and natural language generation with large language models (LLMs) show that $R^3M$ improves robustness of the reward  against several types of perturbations to the preference data."
Poster,Robust Reinforcement Learning with General Utility,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96370,"Ziyi Chen, Yan Wen, Zhengmian Hu, Heng Huang","Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem with general utility is a powerful decision making framework that covers standard RL with cumulative cost, exploration problems, and demonstration learning. Existing works on RL with general utility do not consider the robustness under environmental perturbation, which is important to adapt RL system in the real-world environment that differs from the training environment. To train a robust policy, we propose a robust RL framework with general utility,  which subsumes many existing RL frameworks including RL, robust RL, RL with general utility, constrained RL, robust constrained RL, pure exploration, robust entropy regularized RL, etc. Then we focus on popular convex utility functions, with which our proposed learning framework is a challenging nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization problem, and design a two-phase stochastic policy gradient type algorithm and obtain its sample complexity result for gradient convergence. Furthermore, for convex utility on a widely used polyhedral ambiguity set, we design an algorithm and obtain its convergence rate to a global optimal solution."
Poster,Robust Sleep Staging over Incomplete Multimodal Physiological Signals via Contrastive Imagination,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94475,"Qi Shen, Junchang Xin, Bing Dai, Shudi Zhang, Zhiqiong Wang","Multimodal physiological signals, such as EEG, EOG and EMG, provide rich and reliable physiological information for automated sleep staging (ASS). However, in the real world, the completeness of various modalities is difficult to guarantee, which seriously affects the performance of ASS based on multimodal learning. Furthermore, the exploration of temporal context information within PTSs is also a serious challenge. To this end, we propose a robust multimodal sleep staging framework named contrastive imagination modality sleep network (CIMSleepNet). Specifically, CIMSleepNet handles the issue of arbitrary modal missing through the combination of modal awareness imagination module (MAIM) and semantic & modal calibration contrastive learning (SMCCL). Among them, MAIM can capture the interaction among modalities by learning the shared representation distribution of all modalities. Meanwhile, SMCCL introduces prior information of semantics and modalities to check semantic consistency while maintaining the uniqueness of each modality. Utilizing the calibration of SMCCL, the data distribution recovered by MAIM is aligned with the real data distribution. We further design a multi-level cross-branch temporal attention mechanism, which can facilitate the mining of interactive temporal context representations at both the intra-epoch and inter-epoch levels. Extensive experiments on five multimodal sleep datasets demonstrate that CIMSleepNet remarkably outperforms other competitive methods under various missing modality patterns.

Poster,Robust Sparse Regression with Non-Isotropic Designs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94686,"Chih-Hung Liu, Gleb Novikov","We develop a technique to design efficiently computable estimators for sparse linear regression in the simultaneous presence of two adversaries: oblivious and adaptive.Consider the model $y^*=X^*\beta^*+ \eta$ where $X^*$ is an $n\times d$ random design matrix, $\beta^*\in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a $k$-sparse vector, and the noise $\eta$ is independent of $X^*$ and chosen by the \emph{oblivious adversary}. Apart from the independence of $X^*$, we only require a small fraction entries of $\eta$ to have magnitude at most $1$. The \emph{adaptive adversary} is allowed to arbitrarily corrupt an $\varepsilon$-fraction of the samples $(X_1^*, y_1^*),\ldots, (X_n^*, y_n^*)$.Given the $\varepsilon$-corrupted samples $(X_1, y_1),\ldots, (X_n, y_n)$, the goal is to estimate $\beta^*$.  We assume that the rows of $X^*$ are iid samples from some $d$-dimensional distribution $\mathcal{D}$  with zero mean and (unknown) covariance matrix $\Sigma$ with bounded condition number.We design several robust algorithms that outperform the state of the art even in the special case of Gaussian noise $\eta \sim N(0,1)^n$. In particular, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that with high probability recovers $\beta^*$ up to error $O(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$  as long as  $n \ge \tilde{O}(k^2/\varepsilon)$, only assuming some bounds on the third and the fourth moments of $\mathcal{D}$. In addition, prior to this work, even in the special case of Gaussian design $\mathcal{D} = N(0,\Sigma)$ and noise $\eta \sim N(0,1)$, no polynomial time algorithm was known to achieve error $o(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ in the sparse setting $n < d^2$.  We show that under some assumptions on the fourth and the eighth moments of $\mathcal{D}$, there is a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves error $o(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ as long as $n \ge \tilde{O}(k^4 / \varepsilon^3)$. For Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{D} = N(0,\Sigma)$, this algorithm achieves error $O(\varepsilon^{3/4})$. Moreover, our algorithm achieves error $o(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ for all log-concave distributions if $\varepsilon \le 1/\text{polylog(d)}$. Our algorithms are based on the filtering  of the covariates that uses sum-of-squares relaxations, and weighted Huber loss minimization with $\ell_1$ regularizer.  We provide a novel analysis of weighted penalized Huber loss that is suitable for heavy-tailed designs in the presence of two adversaries. Furthermore, we complement our algorithmic results with Statistical Query lower bounds, providing evidence that our estimators are likely to have nearly optimal sample complexity."
Poster,ROIDICE: Offline Return on Investment Maximization for Efficient Decision Making,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96531,"Woosung Kim, Hayeong Lee, Jongmin Lee, Byung-Jun Lee","In this paper, we propose a novel policy optimization framework that maximizes Return on Investment (ROI) of a policy using a fixed dataset within a Markov Decision Process (MDP) equipped with a cost function. ROI, defined as the ratio between the return and the accumulated cost of a policy, serves as a measure of efficiency of the policy. Despite the importance of maximizing ROI in various applications, it remains a challenging problem due to its nature as a ratio of two long-term values: return and accumulated cost. To address this, we formulate the ROI maximizing reinforcement learning problem as a linear fractional programming. We then incorporate the stationary distribution correction (DICE) framework to develop a practical offline ROI maximization algorithm.Our proposed algorithm, ROIDICE, yields an efficient policy that offers a superior trade-off between return and accumulated cost compared to policies trained using existing frameworks."
