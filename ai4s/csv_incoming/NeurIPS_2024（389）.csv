Poster,SUGARCREPE++ Dataset: Vision-Language Model Sensitivity to Semantic and Lexical Alterations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97833,"Sri Harsha Dumpala, Aman Jaiswal, Chandramouli Shama Sastry, Evangelos Milios, Sageev Oore, Hassan Sajjad","Despite their remarkable successes, state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), including vision-and-language models (VLMs) and unimodal language models (ULMs), fail to understand precise semantics. For example, semantically equivalent sentences expressed using different lexical compositions elicit diverging representations. The degree of this divergence and its impact on encoded semantics is not very well understood. In this paper, we introduce the SUGARCREPE++ dataset to analyze the sensitivity of VLMs and ULMs to lexical and semantic alterations. Each sample in SUGARCREPE++ dataset consists of an image and a corresponding triplet of captions: a pair of semantically equivalent but lexically different positive captions and one hard negative caption. This poses a 3-way semantic (in)equivalence problem to the language models. We comprehensively evaluate VLMs and ULMs that differ in architecture, pre-training objectives and datasets to benchmark the performance of SUGARCREPE++ dataset. Experimental results highlight the difficulties of VLMs in distinguishing between lexical and semantic variations, particularly to object attributes and spatial relations. Although VLMs with larger pre-training datasets, model sizes, and multiple pre-training objectives achieve better performance on SUGARCREPE++, there is a significant opportunity for improvement. We demonstrate that models excelling on compositionality datasets may not perform equally well on SUGARCREPE++. This indicates that compositionality alone might not be sufficient to fully understand semantic and lexical alterations. Given the importance of the property that the SUGARCREPE++ dataset targets, it serves as a new challenge to the vision-and-language community.

Poster,Suitable is the Best: Task-Oriented Knowledge Fusion in Vulnerability Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95375,"Jingjing Wang, Minhuan Huang, yuanping nie, Xiang Li, Qianjin Du, Wei Kong, Huan Deng, Xiaohui Kuang","Deep learning technologies have demonstrated remarkable performance in vulnerability detection. Existing works primarily adopt a uniform and consistent feature learning pattern across the entire target set. While designed for general-purpose detection tasks, they lack sensitivity towards target code comprising multiple functional modules or diverse vulnerability subtypes. In this paper, we present a knowledge fusion-based vulnerability detection method (KF-GVD) that integrates specific vulnerability knowledge into the Graph Neural Network feature learning process. KF-GVD achieves accurate vulnerability detection across different functional modules of the Linux kernel and vulnerability subtypes without compromising general task performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KF-GVD outperforms SOTAs on function-level and statement-level vulnerability detection across various target tasks, with an average increase of 40.9% in precision and 26.1% in recall. Notably, KF-GVD discovered 9 undisclosed vulnerabilities when employing on C/C++ open-source projects without ground truth."
Poster,Super Consistency of Neural Network Landscapes and Learning Rate Transfer,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93421,"Lorenzo Noci, Alexandru Meterez, Thomas Hofmann, Antonio Orvieto","Recently, there has been growing evidence that if the width and depth of a neural network are scaled toward the so-called rich feature learning limit ($\mu$P and its depth extension), then some hyperparameters --- such as the learning rate --- exhibit transfer from small to very large models. From an optimization perspective, this phenomenon is puzzling, as it implies that the loss landscape is consistently similar across very different model sizes. In this work, we study the landscape through the lens of the Hessian, with a focus on its largest eigenvalue (i.e. the sharpness), and find that certain spectral properties under $\mu$P are largely independent of the width and depth of the network along the training trajectory. We name this property *super consistency* of the landscape. On the other hand, we show that in the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) and other scaling regimes, the sharpness exhibits very different dynamics at different scales. But what causes these differences in the sharpness dynamics? Through a connection between the Hessian's and the NTK's spectrum, we argue that the cause lies in the presence (for $\mu$P) or progressive absence (for the NTK scaling) of feature learning.We corroborate our claims with a substantial suite of experiments, covering a wide range of datasets and architectures: from ResNets and Vision Transformers trained on benchmark vision datasets to Transformers-based language models trained on WikiText."
Poster,SuperDeepFool: a new fast and accurate minimal adversarial attack,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93530,"alireza abdollahpour, Mahed Abroshan, Seyed-Mohsen Moosavi-Dezfooli","Deep neural networks have been known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are inputs that are modified slightly to fool the network into making incorrect predictions. This has led to a significant amount of research on evaluating the robustness of these networks against such perturbations. One particularly important robustness metric is the robustness to minimal $\ell_{2}$ adversarial perturbations. However, existing methods for evaluating this robustness metric are either computationally expensive or not very accurate. In this paper, we introduce a new family of adversarial attacks that strike a balance between effectiveness and computational efficiency. Our proposed attacks are generalizations of the well-known DeepFool (DF) attack, while they remain simple to understand and implement. We demonstrate that our attacks outperform existing methods in terms of both effectiveness and computational efficiency. Our proposed attacks are also suitable for evaluating the robustness of large models and can be used to perform adversarial training (AT) to achieve state-of-the-art robustness to minimal $\ell_{2}$ adversarial perturbations."
Poster,Superposed Decoding: Multiple Generations from a Single Autoregressive Inference Pass,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95663,"Ethan Shen, Alan Fan, Sarah Pratt, Jae Sung Park, Matthew Wallingford, Sham Kakade, Ari Holtzman, Ranjay Krishna, Ali Farhadi, Aditya Kusupati","Many applications today provide users with multiple auto-complete drafts as they type, including GitHub's code completion, Gmail's smart compose, and Apple's messaging auto-suggestions. Under the hood, language models support this by running an autoregressive inference pass to provide a draft. Consequently, providing $k$ drafts to the user requires running an expensive language model $k$ times. To alleviate the computation cost of running $k$ inference passes, we propose Superposed Decoding, a new decoding algorithm that generates $k$ drafts at the computation cost of one autoregressive inference pass. We achieve this by feeding a superposition of the most recent token embeddings from the $k$ drafts as input to the next decoding step of the language model. At every inference step we combine the $k$ drafts with the top-$k$ tokens to get $k^2$ new drafts and cache the $k$ most likely options, using an n-gram interpolation with minimal compute overhead to filter out incoherent generations. Our experiments show that $k$ drafts from Superposed Decoding are at least as coherent and factual as Nucleus Sampling and Greedy Decoding respectively, while being at least $2.44\times$ faster for $k\ge3$. In a compute-normalized setting, user evaluations demonstrably favor text generated by Superposed Decoding over Nucleus Sampling. Superposed Decoding can also be combined with other decoding strategies, resulting in universal coverage gains when scaling inference time compute.

Poster,Supervised Kernel Thinning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96561,"Albert Gong, Kyuseong Choi, Raaz Dwivedi","The kernel thinning algorithm of Dwivedi & Mackey (2024) provides a better-than-i.i.d. compression of a generic set of points. By generating high-fidelity coresets of size significantly smaller than the input points, KT is known to speed up unsupervised tasks like Monte Carlo integration, uncertainty quantification, and non-parametric hypothesis testing, with minimal loss in statistical accuracy. In this work, we generalize the KT algorithm to speed up supervised learning problems involving kernel methods. Specifically, we combine two classical algorithms---Nadaraya-Watson (NW) regression or kernel smoothing, and kernel ridge regression (KRR)---with KT to provide a quadratic speed-up in both training and inference times. We show how distribution compression with KT in each setting reduces to constructing an appropriate kernel, and introduce the Kernel-Thinned NW and Kernel-Thinned KRR estimators. We prove that KT-based regression estimators enjoy significantly superior computational efficiency over the full-data estimators and improved statistical efficiency over i.i.d. subsampling of the training data. En route, we also provide a novel multiplicative error guarantee for compressing with KT.  We validate our design choices with both simulations and real data experiments."
Poster,SuperVLAD: Compact and Robust Image Descriptors for Visual Place Recognition,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94478,"Feng Lu, Xinyao Zhang, Canming Ye, Shuting Dong, Lijun Zhang, Xiangyuan Lan, Chun Yuan","Visual place recognition (VPR) is an essential task for multiple applications such as augmented reality and robot localization. Over the past decade, mainstream methods in the VPR area have been to use feature representation based on global aggregation, as exemplified by NetVLAD. These features are suitable for large-scale VPR and robust against viewpoint changes. However, the VLAD-based aggregation methods usually learn a large number of (e.g., 64) clusters and their corresponding cluster centers, which directly leads to a high dimension of the yielded global features. More importantly, when there is a domain gap between the data in training and inference, the cluster centers determined on the training set are usually improper for inference, resulting in a performance drop. To this end, we first attempt to improve NetVLAD by removing the cluster center and setting only a small number of (e.g., only 4) clusters. The proposed method not only simplifies NetVLAD but also enhances the generalizability across different domains. We name this method SuperVLAD. In addition, by introducing ghost clusters that will not be retained in the final output, we further propose a very low-dimensional 1-Cluster VLAD descriptor, which has the same dimension as the output of GeM pooling but performs notably better. Experimental results suggest that, when paired with a transformer-based backbone, our SuperVLAD shows better domain generalization performance than NetVLAD with significantly fewer parameters. The proposed method also surpasses state-of-the-art methods with lower feature dimensions on several benchmark datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/lu-feng/SuperVLAD."
Poster,Suppress Content Shift: Better Diffusion Features via Off-the-Shelf Generation Techniques,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95209,"Benyuan Meng, Qianqian Xu, Zitai Wang, Zhiyong Yang, Xiaochun Cao, Qingming Huang","Diffusion models are powerful generative models, and this capability can also be applied to discrimination. The inner activations of a pre-trained diffusion model can serve as features for discriminative tasks, namely, diffusion feature. We discover that diffusion feature has been hindered by a hidden yet universal phenomenon that we call content shift. To be specific, there are content differences between features and the input image, such as the exact shape of a certain object. We locate the cause of content shift as one inherent characteristic of diffusion models, which suggests the broad existence of this phenomenon in diffusion feature. Further empirical study also indicates that its negative impact is not negligible even when content shift is not visually perceivable. Hence, we propose to suppress content shift to enhance the overall quality of diffusion features. Specifically, content shift is related to the information drift during the process of recovering an image from the noisy input, pointing out the possibility of turning off-the-shelf generation techniques into tools for content shift suppression. We further propose a practical guideline named GATE to efficiently evaluate the potential benefit of a technique and provide an implementation of our methodology. Despite the simplicity, the proposed approach has achieved superior results on various tasks and datasets, validating its potential as a generic booster for diffusion features. Our code is available at https://github.com/Darkbblue/diffusion-content-shift."
Poster,Supra-Laplacian Encoding for Transformer on Dynamic Graphs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93204,"Yannis Karmim, Marc Lafon, Raphael Fournier-S&#x27;niehotta, Nicolas THOME","Fully connected Graph Transformers (GT) have rapidly become prominent in the static graph community as an alternative to Message-Passing models, which suffer from a lack of expressivity, oversquashing, and under-reaching.However, in a dynamic context, by interconnecting all nodes at multiple snapshots with self-attention,GT loose both structural and temporal information. In this work, we introduce Supra-LAplacian encoding for spatio-temporal TransformErs (SLATE), a new spatio-temporal encoding to leverage the GT architecture while keeping spatio-temporal information.Specifically, we transform Discrete Time Dynamic Graphs into multi-layer graphs and take advantage of the spectral properties of their associated supra-Laplacian matrix.Our second contribution explicitly model nodes' pairwise relationships with a cross-attention mechanism, providing an accurate edge representation for dynamic link prediction.SLATE outperforms numerous state-of-the-art methods based on Message-Passing Graph Neural Networks combined with recurrent models (e.g, LSTM), and Dynamic Graph Transformers,on~9 datasets. Code is open-source and available at this link https://github.com/ykrmm/SLATE."
Poster,SureMap: Simultaneous mean estimation for single-task and multi-task disaggregated evaluation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94552,"Misha Khodak, Lester Mackey, Alexandra Chouldechova, Miro Dudik","Disaggregated evaluation&mdash;estimation of performance of a machine learning model on different subpopulations&mdash;is a core task when assessing performance and group-fairness of AI systems.A key challenge is that evaluation data is scarce, and subpopulations arising from intersections of attributes (e.g., race, sex, age) are often tiny.Today, it is common for multiple clients to procure the same AI model from a model developer, and the task of disaggregated evaluation is faced by each customer individually.  This gives rise to what we call the *multi-task disaggregated evaluation problem*, wherein multiple clients seek to conduct a disaggregated evaluation of a given model in their own data setting (task).  In this work we develop a disaggregated evaluation method called **SureMap** that has high estimation accuracy for both multi-task *and* single-task disaggregated evaluations of blackbox models.  SureMap's efficiency gains come from(1) transforming the problem into structured simultaneous Gaussian mean estimation and (2) incorporating external data, e.g., from the AI system creator or from their other clients.  Our method combines *maximum a posteriori* (MAP) estimation using a well-chosen prior together with cross-validation-free tuning via Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE).We evaluate SureMap on disaggregated evaluation tasks in multiple domains, observing significant accuracy improvements over several strong competitors."
