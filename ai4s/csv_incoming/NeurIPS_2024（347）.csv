Poster,Right this way: Can VLMs Guide Us to See More to Answer Questions?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96477,"Li Liu, Diji Yang, Sijia Zhong, Kalyana Suma Sree Tholeti, Lei Ding, Yi Zhang, Leilani Gilpin","In question-answering scenarios, humans can assess whether the available information is sufficient and seek additional information if necessary, rather than providing a forced answer. In contrast, Vision Language Models (VLMs) typically generate direct, one-shot responses without evaluating the sufficiency of the information. To investigate this gap, we identify a critical and challenging task in the Visual Question Answering (VQA) scenario: can VLMs indicate how to adjust an image when the visual information is insufficient to answer a question? This capability is especially valuable for assisting visually impaired individuals who often need guidance to capture images correctly. To evaluate this capability of current VLMs, we introduce a human-labeled dataset as a benchmark for this task. Additionally, we present an automated framework that generates synthetic training data by simulating ``where to know'' scenarios. Our empirical results show significant performance improvements in mainstream VLMs when fine-tuned with this synthetic data. This study demonstrates the potential to narrow the gap between information assessment and acquisition in VLMs, bringing their performance closer to humans."
Poster,Risk-Averse Fine-tuning of Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96880,"Sapana Chaudhary, Ujwal Dinesha, Dileep Kalathil, Srinivas Shakkottai","We consider the challenge of mitigating the generation of negative or toxic content by the Large Language Models (LLMs) in response to certain prompts.  We propose integrating risk-averse principles into LLM fine-tuning to minimize the occurrence of harmful outputs, particularly rare but significant events.  By optimizing the risk measure of Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), our methodology trains LLMs to exhibit superior performance in avoiding toxic outputs while maintaining effectiveness in generative tasks. Empirical evaluations on sentiment modification and toxicity mitigation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of risk-averse reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) in promoting a safer and more constructive online discourse environment."
Poster,Risk-sensitive control as inference with Rényi divergence,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95589,"Kaito Ito, Kenji Kashima","This paper introduces the risk-sensitive control as inference (RCaI) that extends CaI by using Rényi divergence variational inference. RCaI is shown to be equivalent to log-probability regularized risk-sensitive control, which is an extension of the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) control. We also prove that the risk-sensitive optimal policy can be obtained by solving a soft Bellman equation, which reveals several equivalences between RCaI, MaxEnt control, the optimal posterior for CaI, and linearly-solvable control. Moreover, based on RCaI, we derive the risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) methods: the policy gradient and the soft actor-critic. As the risk-sensitivity parameter vanishes, we recover the risk-neutral CaI and RL, which means that RCaI is a unifying framework. Furthermore, we give another risk-sensitive generalization of the MaxEnt control using Rényi entropy regularization. We show that in both of our extensions, the optimal policies have the same structure even though the derivations are very different."
Poster,RLE: A Unified Perspective of Data Augmentation for Cross-Spectral Re-Identification,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95351,"Lei Tan, Yukang Zhang, Keke Han, Pingyang Dai, Yan Zhang, Yongjian Wu, Rongrong Ji","This paper makes a step towards modeling the modality discrepancy in the cross-spectral re-identification task. Based on the Lambertain model, we observe that the non-linear modality discrepancy mainly comes from diverse linear transformations acting on the surface of different materials. From this view, we unify all data augmentation strategies for cross-spectral re-identification as mimicking such local linear transformations and categorize them into moderate transformation and radical transformation. By extending the observation, we propose a Random Linear Enhancement (RLE) strategy which includes Moderate Random Linear Enhancement (MRLE)  and Radical Random Linear Enhancement (RRLE)  to push the boundaries of both types of transformation. Moderate Random Linear Enhancement is designed to provide diverse image transformations that satisfy the original linear correlations under constrained conditions, whereas Radical Random Linear Enhancement seeks to generate local linear transformations directly without relying on external information. The experimental results not only demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of RLE but also confirm its great potential as a general-purpose data augmentation for cross-spectral re-identification."
Poster,RL-GPT: Integrating Reinforcement Learning and Code-as-policy,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95611,"Shaoteng Liu, Haoqi Yuan, Minda Hu, Yanwei Li, Yukang Chen, Shu Liu, Zongqing Lu, Jiaya Jia","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in utilizing various tools by coding, yet they face limitations in handling intricate logic and precise control. In embodied tasks, high-level planning is amenable to direct coding, while low-level actions often necessitate task-specific refinement, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL). To seamlessly integrate both modalities, we introduce a two-level hierarchical framework, RL-GPT, comprising a slow agent and a fast agent. The slow agent analyzes actions suitable for coding, while the fast agent executes coding tasks. This decomposition effectively focuses each agent on specific tasks, proving highly efficient within our pipeline. Our approach outperforms traditional RL methods and existing GPT agents, demonstrating superior efficiency. In the Minecraft game, it rapidly obtains diamonds within a single day on an RTX3090. Additionally, it achieves SOTA performance across all designated MineDojo tasks."
Poster,RL in Latent MDPs is Tractable: Online Guarantees via Off-Policy Evaluation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93928,"Jeongyeol Kwon, Shie Mannor, Constantine Caramanis, Yonathan Efroni","In many real-world decision problems there is partially observed, hidden or latent information that remains fixed throughout an interaction. Such decision problems can be modeled as Latent Markov Decision Processes (LMDPs), where a latent variable is selected at the beginning of an interaction and is not disclosed to the agent initially. In last decade, there has been significant progress in designing learning algorithms for solving LMDPs under different structural assumptions. However, for general LMDPs, there is no known learning algorithm that provably matches the existing lower bound. We effectively resolve this open question, introducing the first sample-efficient algorithm for LMDPs without *any additional structural assumptions*. Our result builds off a new perspective on the role off-policy evaluation guarantees and coverage coefficient in LMDPs, a perspective, which has been overlooked in the context of exploration in partially observed environments. Specifically, we establish a novel off-policy evaluation lemma and introduce a new coverage coefficient for LMDPs. Then, we show how these can be used to derive near-optimal guarantees of an optimistic exploration algorithm. These results, we believe, can be valuable for a wide range of interactive learning problems beyond the LMDP class, and especially, for partially observed environments."
Poster,RL on Incorrect Synthetic Data Scales the Efficiency of LLM Math Reasoning by Eight-Fold,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96295,"Amrith Setlur, Saurabh Garg, Xinyang Geng, Naman Garg, Virginia Smith, Aviral Kumar","Training on model-generated synthetic data is a promising approach for finetuning LLMs, but it remains unclear when it helps or hurts. In this paper, we investigate this question for math reasoning via an empirical study, followed by building a conceptual understanding of our observations. First, we find that while the typical approach of finetuning a model on synthetic correct or positive problem-solution pairs generated by capable models offers modest performance gains, sampling more correct solutions from the finetuned learner itself followed by subsequent fine-tuning on this self-generated data doubles the efficiency of the same synthetic problems. At the same time, training on model-generated positives can amplify various spurious  correlations, resulting in flat or even inverse scaling trends as the amount of data increases. Surprisingly, we find that several of these issues can be addressed if we also utilize negative responses, i.e., model-generated responses that are deemed incorrect by a final answer verifier. Crucially, these negatives must be constructed such that the training can appropriately recover the utility or advantage of each intermediate step in the negative response. With this per-step scheme, we are able to attain consistent gains over only positive data, attaining performance similar to amplifying the amount of synthetic data by $\mathbf{8 \times}$. We show that training on per-step negatives can help to unlearn spurious correlations in the positive data, and is equivalent to advantage-weighted reinforcement learning (RL), implying that it inherits robustness benefits of RL over imitating positive data alone."
Poster,RMLR: Extending Multinomial Logistic Regression into General Geometries,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93848,"Ziheng Chen, Yue Song, Rui Wang, Xiaojun Wu, Nicu Sebe","Riemannian neural networks, which extend deep learning techniques to Riemannian spaces, have gained significant attention in machine learning. To better classify the manifold-valued features, researchers have started extending Euclidean multinomial logistic regression (MLR) into Riemannian manifolds. However, existing approaches suffer from limited applicability due to their strong reliance on specific geometric properties. This paper proposes a framework for designing Riemannian MLR over general geometries, referred to as RMLR. Our framework only requires minimal geometric properties, thus exhibiting broad applicability and enabling its use with a wide range of geometries. Specifically, we showcase our framework on the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold and special orthogonal group, i.e., the set of rotation matrices. On the SPD manifold, we develop five families of SPD MLRs under five types of power-deformed metrics. On rotation matrices we propose Lie MLR based on the popular bi-invariant metric. Extensive experiments on different Riemannian backbone networks validate the effectiveness of our framework."
Poster,Road Network Representation Learning with the Third Law of  Geography,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94142,"Haicang Zhou, Weiming Huang, Yile Chen, Tiantian He, Gao Cong, Yew Soon Ong","Road network representation learning aims to learn compressed and effective vectorized representations for road segments that are applicable to numerous tasks. In this paper, we identify the limitations of existing methods, particularly their overemphasis on the distance effect as outlined in the First Law of Geography. In response,  we propose to endow road network representation with the principles of the recent Third Law of Geography. To this end, we propose a novel graph contrastive learning framework that employs geographic configuration-aware graph augmentation and spectral negative sampling, ensuring that road segments with similar geographic configurations yield similar representations, and vice versa, aligning with the principles stated in the Third Law. The framework further fuses the Third Law with the First Law through a dual contrastive learning objective to effectively balance the implications of both laws. We evaluate our framework on two real-world datasets across three downstream tasks. The results show that the integration of the Third Law significantly improves the performance of road segment representations in downstream tasks."
Poster,ROBIN: Robust and Invisible Watermarks for Diffusion Models with Adversarial Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95144,"Huayang Huang, Yu Wu, Qian Wang","Watermarking generative content serves as a vital tool for authentication, ownership protection, and mitigation of potential misuse. Existing watermarking methods face the challenge of balancing robustness and concealment. They empirically inject a watermark that is both invisible and robust and passively achieve concealment by limiting the strength of the watermark, thus reducing the robustness. In this paper, we propose to explicitly introduce a watermark hiding process to actively achieve concealment, thus allowing the embedding of stronger watermarks. To be specific, we implant a robust watermark in an intermediate diffusion state and then guide the model to hide the watermark in the final generated image. We employ an adversarial optimization algorithm to produce the optimal hiding prompt guiding signal for each watermark. The prompt embedding is optimized to minimize artifacts in the generated image, while the watermark is optimized to achieve maximum strength. The watermark can be verified by reversing the generation process. Experiments on various diffusion models demonstrate the watermark remains verifiable even under significant image tampering and shows superior invisibility compared to other state-of-the-art robust watermarking methods."
