Poster,Causal vs. Anticausal merging of predictors,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93078,"Sergio Garrido Mejia, Patrick Blöbaum, Bernhard Schölkopf, Dominik Janzing","We study the differences arising from merging predictors in the causal and anticausal directions using the same data.In particular we study the asymmetries that arise in a simple model where we merge the predictors using one binary variable as target and two continuous variables as predictors.We use Causal Maximum Entropy (CMAXENT) as inductive bias to merge the predictors, however, we expect similar differences to hold also when we use other merging methods that take into account asymmetries between cause and effect.We show that if we observe all bivariate distributions, the CMAXENT solution reduces to a logistic regression in the causal direction and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in the anticausal direction.Furthermore, we study how the decision boundaries of these two solutions differ whenever we observe only some of the bivariate distributions implications for Out-Of-Variable (OOV) generalisation."
Poster,Cell ontology guided transcriptome foundation model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94537,"XINYU YUAN, Zhihao Zhan, Zuobai Zhang, Manqi Zhou, Jianan Zhao, Boyu Han, Yue Li, Jian Tang","Transcriptome foundation models (TFMs) hold great promises of deciphering the transcriptomic language that dictate diverse cell functions by self-supervised learning on large-scale single-cell gene expression data, and ultimately unraveling the complex mechanisms of human diseases. However, current TFMs treat cells as independent samples and ignore the taxonomic relationships between cell types, which are available in cell ontology graphs. We argue that effectively leveraging this ontology information during the TFM pre-training can improve learning biologically meaningful gene co-expression patterns while preserving TFM as a general purpose foundation model for downstream zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. To this end, we present **s**ingle **c**ell, **Cell**-**o**ntology guided TFM (scCello). We introduce cell-type coherence loss and ontology alignment loss, which are minimized along with the masked gene expression prediction loss during the pre-training. The novel loss component guide scCello to learn the cell-type-specific representation and the structural relation between cell types from the cell ontology graph, respectively. We pre-trained scCello on 22 million cells from CellxGene database leveraging their cell-type labels mapped to the cell ontology graph from Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology Foundry. Our TFM demonstrates competitive generalization and transferability performance over the existing TFMs on biologically important tasks including identifying novel cell types of unseen cells, prediction of cell-type-specific marker genes, and cancer drug responses.

Poster,CemiFace: Center-based Semi-hard Synthetic Face Generation for Face Recognition,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92997,"Zhonglin Sun, Siyang Song, Ioannis Patras, Georgios Tzimiropoulos","Privacy issue is a main concern in developing face recognition techniques. Although synthetic face images can partially mitigate potential legal risks while maintaining effective face recognition (FR) performance, FR models trained by face images synthesized by existing generative approaches frequently suffer from performance degradation problems due to the insufficient discriminative quality of these synthesized samples. In this paper, we systematically investigate what contributes to solid face recognition model training, and reveal that face images with certain degree of similarities to their identity centers show great effectiveness in the performance of trained FR models. Inspired by this, we propose a novel diffusion-based approach (namely **Ce**nter-based Se**mi**-hard Synthetic FaceGeneration (**CemiFace**) which produces facial samples with various levels of similarity to the subject center, thus allowing to generate face datasets containing effective discriminative samples for training face recognition. Experimental results show that with a modest degree of similarity, training on the generated dataset can produce competitive performance compared to previous generation methods.

Poster,CE-NAS: An End-to-End Carbon-Efficient Neural Architecture Search Framework,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93227,"Yiyang Zhao, Yunzhuo Liu, Bo Jiang, Tian Guo","This work presents a novel approach to neural architecture search (NAS) that aims to increase carbon efficiency for the model design process. The proposed framework CE-NAS addresses the key challenge of high carbon cost associated with NAS by exploring the carbon emission variations of energy and energy differences of different NAS algorithms. At the high level, CE-NAS leverages a reinforcement-learning agent to dynamically adjust GPU resources based on carbon intensity, predicted by a time-series transformer, to balance energy-efficient sampling and energy-intensive evaluation tasks. Furthermore, CE-NAS leverages a recently proposed multi-objective optimizer to effectively reduce the NAS search space. We demonstrate the efficacy of CE-NAS in lowering carbon emissions while achieving SOTA results for both NAS datasets and open-domain NAS tasks. For example, on the HW-NasBench dataset, CE-NAS reduces carbon emissions by up to 7.22X while maintaining a search efficiency comparable to vanilla NAS. For open-domain NAS tasks, CE-NAS achieves SOTA results with 97.35% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 with only 1.68M parameters and a carbon consumption of 38.53 lbs of CO2. On ImageNet, our searched model achieves 80.6% top-1 accuracy with a 0.78 ms TensorRT latency using FP16 on NVIDIA V100, consuming only 909.86 lbs of CO2, making it comparable to other one-shot-based NAS baselines.

Poster,Certified Adversarial Robustness via Randomized $\alpha$-Smoothing for Regression Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93964,"Aref Rekavandi, Farhad Farokhi, Olga Ohrimenko, Benjamin Rubinstein","Certified adversarial robustness of large-scale deep networks has progressed substantially after the introduction of randomized smoothing. Deep net classifiers are now provably robust in their predictions against a large class of threat models, including $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, and $\ell_\infty$ norm-bounded attacks. Certified robustness analysis by randomized smoothing has not been performed for deep regression networks where the output variable is continuous and unbounded. In this paper, we extend the existing results for randomized smoothing into regression models using powerful tools from robust statistics, in particular, $\alpha$-trimming filter as the smoothing function. Adjusting the hyperparameter $\alpha$ achieves a smooth trade-off between desired certified robustness and utility. For the first time, we propose a benchmark for certified robust regression in visual positioning systems using the Cambridge Landmarks dataset where robustness analysis is essential for autonomous navigation of AI agents and self-driving cars.

Poster,Certified Machine Unlearning via Noisy Stochastic Gradient Descent,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94094,"Eli Chien, Haoyu Wang, Ziang Chen, Pan Li","``The right to be forgotten'' ensured by laws for user data privacy becomes increasingly important. Machine unlearning aims to efficiently remove the effect of certain data points on the trained model parameters so that it can be approximately the same as if one retrains the model from scratch. We propose to leverage projected noisy stochastic gradient descent for unlearning and establish its first approximate unlearning guarantee under the convexity assumption. Our approach exhibits several benefits, including provable complexity saving compared to retraining, and supporting sequential and batch unlearning. Both of these benefits are closely related to our new results on the infinite Wasserstein distance tracking of the adjacent (un)learning processes. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves a similar utility under the same privacy constraint while using $2\%$ and $10\%$ of the gradient computations compared with the state-of-the-art gradient-based approximate unlearning methods for mini-batch and full-batch settings, respectively."
Poster,Certified Robustness for Deep Equilibrium Models via Serialized Random Smoothing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94791,"Weizhi Gao, Zhichao Hou, Han Xu, Xiaorui Liu","Implicit models such as Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) have emerged as promising alternative approaches for building deep neural networks. Their certified robustness has gained increasing research attention due to security concerns. Existing certified defenses for DEQs employing interval bound propagation and Lipschitz-bounds not only offer conservative certification bounds but also are restricted to specific forms of DEQs. In this paper, we provide the first randomized smoothing certified defense for DEQs to solve these limitations. Our study reveals that simply applying randomized smoothing to certify DEQs provides certified robustness generalized to large-scale datasets but incurs extremely expensive computation costs. To reduce computational redundancy, we propose a novel Serialized Randomized Smoothing (SRS) approach that leverages historical information. Additionally, we derive a new certified radius estimation for SRS to theoretically ensure the correctness of our algorithm. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on image recognition demonstrate that our algorithm can significantly accelerate the certification of DEQs by up to 7x almost without sacrificing the certified accuracy. The implementation will be publicly available upon the acceptance of this work. Our code is available at https://github.com/WeizhiGao/Serialized-Randomized-Smoothing."
Poster,C-GAIL: Stabilizing Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning with Control Theory,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93361,"Tianjiao Luo, Tim Pearce, Huayu Chen, Jianfei Chen, Jun Zhu","Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) provides a promising approach to training a generative policy to imitate a demonstrator. It uses on-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a reward signal derived from an adversarial discriminator. However, optimizing GAIL is difficult in practise, with the training loss oscillating during training, slowing convergence. This optimization instability can prevent GAIL from finding a good policy, harming its final performance. In this paper, we study GAIL’s optimization from a control-theoretic perspective. We show that GAIL cannot converge to the desired equilibrium. In response, we analyze the training dynamics of GAIL in function space and design a novel controller that not only pushes GAIL to the desired equilibrium but also achieves asymptotic stability in a simplified “one-step” setting. Going from theory to practice, we propose Controlled-GAIL (C-GAIL), which adds a differentiable regularization term on the GAIL objective to stabilize training. Empirically, the C-GAIL regularizer improves the training of various existing GAIL methods, including the popular GAIL-DAC, by speeding up the convergence, reducing the range of oscillation, and matching the expert distribution more closely."
Poster,Chain of Agents: Large Language Models Collaborating on Long-Context Tasks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95563,"Yusen Zhang, Ruoxi Sun, Yanfei Chen, Tomas Pfister, Rui Zhang, Sercan Arik","Addressing the challenge of effectively processing long contexts has become a critical issue for Large Language Models (LLMs). Two common strategies have emerged: 1) reducing the input length, such as retrieving relevant chunks by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and 2) expanding the context window limit of LLMs. However, both strategies have drawbacks: input reduction has no guarantee of covering the part with needed information, while window extension struggles with focusing on the pertinent information for solving the task. To mitigate these limitations, we propose Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel framework that harnesses multi-agent collaboration through natural language to enable information aggregation and context reasoning across various LLMs over long-context tasks. CoA consists of multiple worker agents who sequentially communicate to handle different segmented portions of the text, followed by a manager agent who synthesizes these contributions into a coherent final output. CoA processes the entire input by interleaving reading and reasoning, and it mitigates long context focus issues by assigning each agent a short context. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of CoA on a wide range of long-context tasks in question answering, summarization, and code completion, demonstrating significant improvements by up to 10% over strong baselines of RAG, Full-Context, and multi-agent LLMs."
Poster,Chain of Preference Optimization: Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96804,"Xuan Zhang, Chao Du, Tianyu Pang, Qian Liu, Wei Gao, Min Lin","The recent development of chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding has enabled large language models (LLMs) to generate explicit logical reasoning paths for complex problem-solving. However, research indicates that these paths are not always deliberate and optimal. The tree-of-thought (ToT) method employs tree-searching to extensively explore the reasoning space and find better reasoning paths that CoT decoding might overlook. This deliberation, however, comes at the cost of significantly increased inference complexity. In this work, we demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs leveraging the search tree constructed by ToT allows CoT to achieve similar or better performance, thereby avoiding the substantial inference burden. This is achieved through \emph{Chain of Preference Optimization} (CPO), where LLMs are fine-tuned to align each step of the CoT reasoning paths with those of ToT using the inherent preference information in the tree-search process. Extensive experimental results show that CPO significantly improves LLM performance in solving a variety of complex problems, including question answering, fact verification, and arithmetic reasoning, demonstrating its effectiveness.
