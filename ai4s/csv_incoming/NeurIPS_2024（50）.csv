Poster,Benchmarking Structural Inference Methods for Interacting Dynamical Systems with Synthetic Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97536,"Aoran Wang, Tsz Pan Tong, Andrzej Mizera, Jun Pang","Understanding complex dynamical systems begins with identifying their topological structures, which expose the organization of the systems. This requires robust structural inference methods that can deduce structure from observed behavior. However, existing methods are often domain-specific and lack a standardized, objective comparison framework. We address this gap by benchmarking 13 structural inference methods from various disciplines on simulations representing two types of dynamics and 11 interaction graph models, supplemented by a biological experimental dataset to mirror real-world application. We evaluated the methods for accuracy, scalability, robustness, and sensitivity to graph properties. Our findings indicate that deep learning methods excel with multi-dimensional data, while classical statistics and information theory based approaches are notably accurate and robust. Additionally, performance correlates positively with the graph's average shortest path length. This benchmark should aid researchers in selecting suitable methods for their specific needs and stimulate further methodological innovation."
Poster,Benchmarking the Attribution Quality of Vision Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97644,"Robin Hesse, Simone Schaub-Meyer, Stefan Roth","Attribution maps are one of the most established tools to explain the functioning of computer vision models. They assign importance scores to input features, indicating how relevant each feature is for the prediction of a deep neural network. While much research has gone into proposing new attribution methods, their proper evaluation remains a difficult challenge. In this work, we propose a novel evaluation protocol that overcomes two fundamental limitations of the widely used incremental-deletion protocol, i.e., the out-of-domain issue and lacking inter-model comparisons. This allows us to evaluate 23 attribution methods and how different design choices of popular vision backbones affect their attribution quality. We find that intrinsically explainable models outperform standard models and that raw attribution values exhibit a higher attribution quality than what is known from previous work. Further, we show consistent changes in the attribution quality when varying the network design, indicating that some standard design choices promote attribution quality."
Poster,Benchmarking Uncertainty Disentanglement: Specialized Uncertainties for Specialized Tasks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97444,"Bálint Mucsányi, Michael Kirchhof, Seong Joon Oh","Uncertainty quantification, once a singular task, has evolved into a spectrum of tasks, including abstained prediction, out-of-distribution detection, and aleatoric uncertainty quantification. The latest goal is disentanglement: the construction of multiple estimators that are each tailored to one and only one source of uncertainty. This paper presents the first benchmark of uncertainty disentanglement. We reimplement and evaluate a comprehensive range of uncertainty estimators, from Bayesian over evidential to deterministic ones, across a diverse range of uncertainty tasks on ImageNet. We find that, despite recent theoretical endeavors, no existing approach provides pairs of disentangled uncertainty estimators in practice. We further find that specialized uncertainty tasks are harder than predictive uncertainty tasks, where we observe saturating performance. Our results provide both practical advice for which uncertainty estimators to use for which specific task, and reveal opportunities for future research toward task-centric and disentangled uncertainties. All our reimplementations and Weights & Biases logs are available at https://github.com/bmucsanyi/untangle."
Poster,BenchMARL: Benchmarking Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/98318,"Matteo Bettini, Amanda Prorok, Vincent MOENS","The field of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is currently facing a reproducibility crisis. While solutions for standardized reporting have been proposed to address the issue, we still lack a benchmarking tool that enables standardization and reproducibility, while leveraging cutting-edge Reinforcement Learning (RL) implementations. In this paper, we introduce BenchMARL, the first MARL training library created to enable standardized benchmarking across different algorithms, models, and environments. BenchMARL uses TorchRL as its backend, granting it high-performance and maintained state-of-the-art implementations while addressing the broad community of MARL PyTorch users. Its design enables systematic configuration and reporting, thus allowing users to create and run complex benchmarks from simple one-line inputs. BenchMARL is open-sourced on GitHub at https://github.com/facebookresearch/BenchMARL"
Poster,BenchX: A Unified Benchmark Framework for Medical Vision-Language Pretraining on Chest X-Rays,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97555,"Yang Zhou, Tan Faith, Yanyu Xu, Sicong Leng, Xinxing Xu, Yong Liu, Rick Siow Mong Goh","Medical Vision-Language Pretraining (MedVLP) shows promise in learning generalizable and transferable visual representations from paired and unpaired medical images and reports. MedVLP can provide useful features to downstream tasks and facilitate adapting task-specific models to new setups using fewer examples. However, existing MedVLP methods often differ in terms of datasets, preprocessing, and finetuning implementations. This pose great challenges in evaluating how well a MedVLP method generalizes to various clinically-relevant tasks due to the lack of unified, standardized, and comprehensive benchmark. To fill this gap, we propose BenchX, a unified benchmark framework that enables head-to-head comparison and systematical analysis between MedVLP methods using public chest X-ray datasets. Specifically, BenchX is composed of three components: 1) Comprehensive datasets covering nine datasets and four medical tasks; 2) Benchmark suites to standardize data preprocessing, train-test splits, and parameter selection; 3) Unified finetuning protocols that accommodate heterogeneous MedVLP methods for consistent task adaptation in classification, segmentation, and report generation, respectively. Utilizing BenchX, we establish baselines for nine state-of-the-art MedVLP methods and found that the performance of some early MedVLP methods can be enhanced to surpass more recent ones, prompting a revisiting of the developments and conclusions from prior works in MedVLP. Our code are available at https://github.com/yangzhou12/BenchX."
Poster,BendVLM: Test-Time Debiasing of Vision-Language Embeddings,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93242,"Walter Gerych, Haoran Zhang, Kimia Hamidieh, Eileen Pan, Maanas K. Sharma, Tom Hartvigsen, Marzyeh Ghassemi","Vision-language (VL) embedding models have been shown to encode biases present in their training data, such as societal biases that prescribe negative characteristics to members of various racial and gender identities. Due to their wide-spread adoption for various tasks ranging from few-shot classification to text-guided image generation, debiasing VL models is crucial. Debiasing approaches that fine-tune the VL model often suffer from catastrophic forgetting. On the other hand, fine-tuning-free methods typically utilize a ``one-size-fits-all"" approach that assumes that correlation with the spurious attribute can be explained using a single linear direction across all possible inputs. In this work, we propose a nonlinear, fine-tuning-free approach for VL embedding model debiasing that tailors the debiasing operation to each unique input. This allows for a more flexible debiasing approach. Additionally, we do not require knowledge of the set of inputs a priori to inference time, making our method more appropriate for online tasks such as retrieval and text guided image generation."
Poster,Benign overfitting in leaky ReLU networks with moderate input dimension,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96392,"Kedar Karhadkar, Erin George, Michael Murray, Guido Montufar, Deanna Needell","The problem of benign overfitting asks whether it is possible for a model to perfectly fit noisy training data and still generalize well. We study benign overfitting in two-layer leaky ReLU networks trained with the hinge loss on a binary classification task. We consider input data which can be decomposed into the sum of a common signal and a random noise component, which lie on subspaces orthogonal to one another. We characterize conditions on the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the model parameters giving rise to benign versus non-benign, or harmful, overfitting: in particular, if the SNR is high then benign overfitting occurs, conversely if the SNR is low then harmful overfitting occurs. We attribute both benign and non-benign overfitting to an approximate margin maximization property and show that leaky ReLU networks trained on hinge loss with gradient descent (GD) satisfy this property. In contrast to prior work we do not require the training data to be nearly orthogonal. Notably, for input dimension $d$ and training sample size $n$, while results in prior work require $d = \Omega(n^2 \log n)$, here we require only $d = \Omega(n)$."
Poster,BertaQA: How Much Do Language Models Know About Local Culture?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97695,"Julen Etxaniz, Gorka Azkune, Aitor Soroa, Oier Lacalle, Mikel Artetxe","Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit extensive knowledge about the world, but most evaluations have been limited to global or anglocentric subjects. This raises the question of how well these models perform on topics relevant to other cultures, whose presence on the web is not that prominent. To address this gap, we introduce BertaQA, a multiple-choice trivia dataset that is parallel in English and Basque. The dataset consists of a local subset with questions pertinent to the Basque culture, and a global subset with questions of broader interest. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with local cultural knowledge, even as they excel on global topics. However, we show that continued pre-training in Basque significantly improves the models' performance on Basque culture, even when queried in English. To our knowledge, this is the first solid evidence of knowledge transfer from a low-resource to a high-resource language. Our analysis sheds light on the complex interplay between language and knowledge, and reveals that some prior findings do not fully hold when reassessed on local topics. Our dataset and evaluation code are available under open licenses at https://github.com/juletx/BertaQA."
Poster,BERTs are Generative In-Context Learners,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96206,David Samuel,"While in-context learning is commonly associated with causal language models, such as GPT, we demonstrate that this capability also 'emerges' in masked language models. Through an embarrassingly simple inference technique, we enable an existing masked model, DeBERTa, to perform generative tasks without additional training or architectural changes. Our evaluation reveals that the masked and causal language models behave very differently, as they clearly outperform each other on different categories of tasks. These complementary strengths suggest that the field's focus on causal models for in-context learning may be limiting – both architectures can develop these capabilities, but with distinct advantages; pointing toward promising hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of both objectives."
Poster,"BetterBench: Assessing AI Benchmarks, Uncovering Issues, and Establishing Best Practices",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97566,"Anka Reuel-Lamparth, Amelia Hardy, Chandler Smith, Max Lamparth, Malcolm Hardy, Mykel J Kochenderfer","AI models are increasingly prevalent in high-stakes environments, necessitating thorough assessment of their capabilities and risks. Benchmarks are popular for measuring these attributes and for comparing model performance, tracking progress, and identifying weaknesses in foundation and non-foundation models. They can inform model selection for downstream tasks and influence policy initiatives. However, not all benchmarks are the same: their quality depends on their design and usability. In this paper, we develop an assessment framework considering 40 best practices across a benchmark's life cycle and evaluate 25 AI benchmarks against it. We find that there exist large quality differences and that commonly used benchmarks suffer from significant issues. We further find that most benchmarks do not report statistical significance of their results nor can results be easily replicated. To support benchmark developers in aligning with best practices, we provide a checklist for minimum quality assurance based on our assessment. We also develop a living repository of benchmark assessments to support benchmark comparability."
