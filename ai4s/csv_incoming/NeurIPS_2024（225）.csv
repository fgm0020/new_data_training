Poster,Learning Image Priors Through Patch-Based Diffusion Models for Solving Inverse Problems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95843,"Jason Hu, Bowen Song, Xiaojian Xu, Liyue Shen, Jeffrey Fessler","Diffusion models can learn strong image priors from underlying data distribution and use them to solve inverse problems,but the training process is computationally expensive and requires lots of data.Such bottlenecks prevent most existing works from being feasible for high-dimensional and high-resolution data such as 3D images.This paper proposes a method to learn an efficient data prior for the entire image by training diffusion models only on patches of images.Specifically, we propose a patch-based position-aware diffusion inverse solver, called PaDIS, where we obtain the score function of the whole image through scores of patches and their positional encoding and utilize this as the prior for solving inverse problems.First of all, we show that this diffusion model achieves an improved memory efficiency and data efficiencywhile still maintaining the  capability to generate entire images via positional encoding.Additionally, the proposed PaDIS model is highly flexible and can be plugged in with different diffusion inverse solvers (DIS).We demonstrate that the proposed PaDIS approach enables solving various inverse problems in both natural and medical image domains, including CT reconstruction, deblurring, and superresolution, given only patch-based priors.Notably, PaDIS outperforms previous DIS methods trained on entire image priors in the case of limited training data, demonstrating the data efficiency of our proposed approach by learning patch-based prior."
Poster,Learning Infinitesimal Generators of Continuous Symmetries from Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93128,"Gyeonghoon Ko, Hyunsu Kim, Juho Lee","Exploiting symmetry inherent in data can significantly improve the sample efficiency of a learning procedure and the generalization of learned models. When data clearly reveals underlying symmetry, leveraging this symmetry can naturally inform the design of model architectures or learning strategies. Yet, in numerous real-world scenarios, identifying the specific symmetry within a given data distribution often proves ambiguous. To tackle this, some existing works learn symmetry in a data-driven manner, parameterizing and learning expected symmetry through data. However, these methods often rely on explicit knowledge, such as pre-defined Lie groups, which are typically restricted to linear or affine transformations. In this paper, we propose a novel symmetry learning algorithm based on transformations defined with one-parameter groups, continuously parameterized transformations flowing along the directions of vector fields called infinitesimal generators. Our method is built upon minimal inductive biases, encompassing not only commonly utilized symmetries rooted in Lie groups but also extending to symmetries derived from nonlinear generators. To learn these symmetries, we introduce a notion of a validity score that examine whether the transformed data is still valid for the given task. The validity score is designed to be fully differentiable and easily computable, enabling effective searches for transformations that achieve symmetries innate to the data. We apply our method mainly in two domains: image data and partial differential equations, and demonstrate its advantages.

Poster,"Learning in Markov Games with Adaptive Adversaries: Policy Regret, Fundamental Barriers, and Efficient Algorithms",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95488,"Thanh Nguyen-Tang, Raman Arora","We study learning in a dynamically evolving environment modeled as a  Markov game between a learner and a strategic opponent that can adapt to the learner's strategies. While most existing works in Markov games focus on external regret as the  learning objective, external regret becomes inadequate when the adversaries are adaptive. In this work, we focus on \emph{policy regret} -- a counterfactual notion that aims to compete with the return that would have been attained if the learner had followed the best fixed sequence of policy, in hindsight. We show that if the opponent has unbounded memory or if it is non-stationary, then sample-efficient learning is not possible. For memory-bounded and stationary, we show that learning is still statistically hard if the set of feasible strategies for the learner is exponentially large. To guarantee learnability, we introduce a new notion of \emph{consistent} adaptive adversaries, wherein, the adversary responds similarly to similar strategies of the learner. We provide algorithms that achieve $\sqrt{T}$ policy regret against memory-bounded, stationary, and consistent adversaries."
Poster,Learning Interaction-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting for One-shot Hand Avatars,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96171,"Xuan Huang, Hanhui Li, Wanquan Liu, Xiaodan Liang, Yiqiang Yan, Yuhao Cheng, CHENQIANG GAO","In this paper, we propose to create animatable avatars for interacting hands with 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and single-image inputs. Existing GS-based methods designed for single subjects often yield unsatisfactory results due to limited input views, various hand poses, and occlusions. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel two-stage interaction-aware GS framework that exploits cross-subject hand priors and refines 3D Gaussians in interacting areas. Particularly, to handle hand variations, we disentangle the 3D presentation of hands into optimization-based identity maps and learning-based latent geometric features and neural texture maps. Learning-based features are captured by trained networks to provide reliable priors for poses, shapes, and textures, while optimization-based identity maps enable efficient one-shot fitting of out-of-distribution hands. Furthermore, we devise an interaction-aware attention module and a self-adaptive Gaussian refinement module. These modules enhance image rendering quality in areas with intra- and inter-hand interactions, overcoming the limitations of existing GS-based methods. Our proposed method is validated via extensive experiments on the large-scale InterHand2.6M dataset, and it significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance in image quality. Code and models will be released upon acceptance."
Poster,Learning Linear Causal Representations from General Environments: Identifiability and Intrinsic Ambiguity,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94358,"Jikai Jin, Vasilis Syrgkanis","We study causal representation learning, the task of recovering high-level latent variables and their causal relationships in the form of a causal graph from low-level observed data (such as text and images), assuming access to observations generated from multiple environments. Prior results on the identifiability of causal representations typically assume access to single-node interventions which is rather unrealistic in practice, since the latent variables are unknown in the first place. In this work, we consider the task of learning causal representation learning with data collected from general environments. We show that even when the causal model and the mixing function are both linear, there exists a surrounded-node ambiguity (SNA) [Varici et al. 2023] which is basically unavoidable in our setting. On the other hand, in the same linear case, we show that identification up to SNA is possible under mild conditions, and propose an algorithm, LiNGCReL which provably achieves such identifiability guarantee. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic data and demonstrate the effectiveness of LiNGCReL in the finite-sample regime."
Poster,Learning Low-Rank Feature for Thorax Disease Classification,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95883,"Yancheng Wang, Rajeev Goel, Utkarsh Nath, Alvin Silva, Teresa Wu, Yingzhen Yang","Deep neural networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Visual Transformers (ViT), have achieved stunning success in the medical image domain. We study thorax disease classification in this paper. Effective extraction of features for the disease areas is crucial for disease classification on radiographic images. While various neural architectures and training techniques, such as self-supervised learning with contrastive/restorative learning, have been employed for disease classification on radiographic images, there are no principled methods that can effectively reduce the adverse effect of noise and background or non-disease areas on the radiographic images for disease classification. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Low-Rank Feature Learning (LRFL) method in this paper, which is universally applicable to the training of all neural networks. The LRFL method is both empirically motivated by a Low Frequency Property (LFP) and theoretically motivated by our sharp generalization bound for neural networks with low-rank features. LFP not only widely exists in deep neural networks for generic machine learning but also exists in all the thorax medical datasets studied in this paper. In the empirical study, using a neural network such as a ViT or a CNN pre-trained on unlabeled chest X-rays by Masked Autoencoders (MAE), our novel LRFL method is applied on the pre-trained neural network and demonstrates better classification results in terms of both multi-class area under the receiver operating curve (mAUC) and classification accuracy than the current state-of-the-art. The code of LRFL is available at \url{https://github.com/Statistical-Deep-Learning/LRFL}."
Poster,Learning Macroscopic Dynamics from Partial Microscopic Observations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94396,"Mengyi Chen, Qianxiao Li","Macroscopic observables of a system are of keen interest in real applications such as the design of novel materials. Current methods rely on microscopic trajectory simulations, where the forces on all microscopic coordinates need to be computed or measured. However,  this can be computationally prohibitive for realistic systems.  In this paper, we propose a method to learn macroscopic dynamics requiring only force computations on a subset of the microscopic coordinates. Our method relies on a sparsity assumption: the force on each microscopic coordinate relies only on a small number of other coordinates. The main idea of our approach is to map the training procedure on the macroscopic coordinates back to the microscopic coordinates, on which partial force computations can be used as stochastic estimation to update model parameters. We provide a theoretical justification of this under suitable conditions. We demonstrate the accuracy, force computation efficiency, and robustness of our method on learning macroscopic closure models from a variety of microscopic systems, including those modeled by partial differential equations or molecular dynamics simulations."
Poster,Learning Mixtures of Unknown Causal Interventions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94578,"Abhinav Kumar, Kirankumar Shiragur, Caroline Uhler","The ability to conduct interventions plays a pivotal role in learning causal relationships among variables, thus facilitating applications across diverse scientific disciplines such as genomics, economics, and machine learning. However, in many instances within these applications, the process of generating interventional data is subject to noise: rather than data being sampled directly from the intended interventional distribution, interventions often yield data sampled from a blend of both intended and unintended interventional distributions.We consider the fundamental challenge of disentangling mixed interventional and observational data within linear Structural Equation Models (SEMs) with Gaussian additive noise without the knowledge of the true causal graph. We demonstrate that conducting interventions, whether do or soft, yields distributions with sufficient diversity and properties conducive to efficiently recovering each component within the mixture. Furthermore, we establish that the sample complexity required to disentangle mixed data inversely correlates with the extent of change induced by an intervention in the equations governing the affected variable values. As a result, the causal graph can be identified up to its interventional Markov Equivalence Class, similar to scenarios where no noise influences the generation of interventional data. We further support our theoretical findings by conducting simulations wherein we perform causal discovery from such mixed data."
Poster,Learning Multimodal Behaviors from Scratch with Diffusion Policy Gradient,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93202,"Steven Li, Rickmer Krohn, Tao Chen, Anurag Ajay, Pulkit Agrawal, Georgia Chalvatzaki","Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically parameterize the policy as a deep network that outputs either a deterministic action or a stochastic one modeled as a Gaussian distribution, hence restricting learning to a single behavioral mode. Meanwhile, diffusion models emerged as a powerful framework for multimodal learning. However, the use of diffusion policies in online RL is hindered by the intractability of policy likelihood approximation, as well as the greedy objective of RL methods that can easily skew the policy to a single mode. This paper presents Deep Diffusion Policy Gradient (DDiffPG), a novel actor-critic algorithm that learns from scratch multimodal policies parameterized as diffusion models while discovering and maintaining versatile behaviors. DDiffPG explores and discovers multiple modes through off-the-shelf unsupervised clustering combined with novelty-based intrinsic motivation. DDiffPG forms a multimodal training batch and utilizes mode-specific Q-learning to mitigate the inherent greediness of the RL objective, ensuring the improvement of the diffusion policy across all modes. Our approach further allows the policy to be conditioned on mode-specific embeddings to explicitly control the learned modes. Empirical studies validate DDiffPG's capability to master multimodal behaviors in complex, high-dimensional continuous control tasks with sparse rewards, also showcasing proof-of-concept dynamic online replanning when navigating mazes with unseen obstacles.

Poster,Learning Neural Contracting Dynamics: Extended Linearization and Global Guarantees,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94690,"Sean Jaffe, Alexander Davydov, Deniz Lapsekili, Ambuj K Singh, Francesco Bullo","Global stability and robustness guarantees in learned dynamical systems are essential to ensure well-behavedness of the systems in the face of uncertainty. We present Extended Linearized Contracting Dynamics (ELCD), the first neural network-based dynamical system with global contractivity guarantees in arbitrary metrics. The key feature of ELCD is a parametrization of the extended linearization of the nonlinear vector field. In its most basic form, ELCD is guaranteed to be (i) globally exponentially stable, (ii) equilibrium contracting, and (iii) globally contracting with respect to some metric. To allow for contraction with respect to more general metrics in the data space, we train diffeomorphisms between the data space and a latent space and enforce contractivity in the latent space, which ensures global contractivity in the data space. We demonstrate the performance of ELCD on the high dimensional LASA, multi-link pendulum, and Rosenbrock datasets."
