Poster,Revisiting Self-Supervised Heterogeneous Graph Learning from Spectral Clustering Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95789,"YUJIE MO, Zhihe Lu, Runpeng Yu, Xiaofeng Zhu, Xinchao Wang","Self-supervised heterogeneous graph learning (SHGL) has shown promising potential in diverse scenarios. However,  while existing SHGL methods share a similar essential with clustering approaches, they encounter two significant limitations: (i) noise in graph structures is often introduced during the message-passing process to weaken node representations, and (ii) cluster-level information may be inadequately captured and leveraged, diminishing the performance in downstream tasks. In this paper, we address these limitations by theoretically revisiting SHGL from the spectral clustering perspective and introducing a novel framework enhanced by rank and dual consistency constraints. Specifically, our framework incorporates a rank-constrained spectral clustering method that refines the affinity matrix to exclude noise effectively. Additionally, we integrate node-level and cluster-level consistency constraints that concurrently capture invariant and clustering information to facilitate learning in downstream tasks. We theoretically demonstrate that the learned representations are divided into distinct partitions based on the number of classes and exhibit enhanced generalization ability across tasks. Experimental results affirm the superiority of our method, showcasing remarkable improvements in several downstream tasks compared to existing methods."
Poster,Revisiting the Integration of Convolution and Attention for Vision Backbone,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93308,"Lei Zhu, Xinjiang Wang, Wayne Zhang, Rynson Lau","Convolutions (Convs) and multi-head self-attentions (MHSAs) are typically considered alternatives to each other for building vision backbones. Although some works try to integrate both, they apply the two operators simultaneously at the finest pixel granularity. With Convs responsible for per-pixel feature extraction already, the question is whether we still need to include the heavy MHSAs at such a fine-grained level. In fact, this is the root cause of the scalability issue w.r.t. the input resolution for vision transformers. To address this important problem, we propose in this work to use MSHAs and Convs in parallel \textbf{at different granularity levels} instead. Specifically, in each layer, we use two different ways to represent an image: a fine-grained regular grid and a coarse-grained set of semantic slots. We apply different operations to these two representations: Convs to the grid for local features, and MHSAs to the slots for global features. A pair of fully differentiable soft clustering and dispatching modules is introduced to bridge the grid and set representations, thus enabling local-global fusion. Through extensive experiments on various vision tasks, we empirically verify the potential of the proposed integration scheme, named \textit{GLMix}: by offloading the burden of fine-grained features to light-weight Convs, it is sufficient to use MHSAs in a few (e.g., 64) semantic slots to match the performance of recent state-of-the-art backbones, while being more efficient. Our visualization results also demonstrate that the soft clustering module produces a meaningful semantic grouping effect with only IN1k classification supervision, which may induce better interpretability and inspire new weakly-supervised semantic segmentation approaches. Code will be available at \url{https://github.com/rayleizhu/GLMix}."
Poster,Revive Re-weighting in Imbalanced Learning by Density Ratio Estimation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93181,"JIAAN LUO, Feng Hong, Jiangchao Yao, Bo Han, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang","In deep learning, model performance often deteriorates when trained on highly imbalanced datasets, especially when evaluation metrics require robust generalization across underrepresented classes. To address the challenges posed by imbalanced data distributions, this study introduces a novel method utilizing density ratio estimation for dynamic class weight adjustment, termed as Re-weighting with Density Ratio (RDR). Our method adaptively adjusts the importance of each class during training, mitigates overfitting on dominant classes and enhances model adaptability across diverse datasets. Extensive experiments conducted on various large scale benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. Results demonstrate substantial improvements in generalization capabilities, particularly under severely imbalanced conditions."
Poster,Reward Machines for Deep RL in Noisy and Uncertain Environments,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96134,"Andrew Li, Zizhao Chen, Toryn Klassen, Pashootan Vaezipoor, Rodrigo Toro Icarte, Sheila McIlraith","Reward Machines provide an automaton-inspired structure for specifying instructions, safety constraints, and other temporally extended reward-worthy behaviour. By exposing the underlying structure of a reward function, they enable the decomposition of an RL task, leading to impressive gains in sample efficiency. Although Reward Machines and similar formal specifications have a rich history of application towards sequential decision-making problems, prior frameworks have traditionally ignored ambiguity and uncertainty when interpreting the domain-specific vocabulary forming the building blocks of the reward function. Such uncertainty critically arises in many real-world settings due to factors like partial observability or noisy sensors. In this work, we explore the use of Reward Machines for Deep RL in noisy and uncertain environments. We characterize this problem as a POMDP and propose a suite of RL algorithms that exploit task structure under uncertain interpretation of the domain-specific vocabulary. Through theory and experiments, we expose pitfalls in naive approaches to this problem while simultaneously demonstrating how task structure can be successfully leveraged under noisy interpretations of the vocabulary."
Poster,ReXTime: A Benchmark Suite for Reasoning-Across-Time in Videos,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97852,"JR-JEN CHEN, Yu-Chien Liao, Hsi-Che Lin, Yu-Chu Yu, Yen-Chun Chen, Frank Wang","We introduce ReXTime, a benchmark designed to rigorously test AI models' ability to perform temporal reasoning within video events.Specifically, ReXTime focuses on reasoning across time, i.e. human-like understanding when the question and its corresponding answer occur in different video segments. This form of reasoning, requiring advanced understanding of cause-and-effect relationships across video segments, poses significant challenges to even the frontier multimodal large language models. To facilitate this evaluation, we develop an automated pipeline for generating temporal reasoning question-answer pairs, significantly reducing the need for labor-intensive manual annotations. Our benchmark includes 921 carefully vetted validation samples and 2,143 test samples, each manually curated for accuracy and relevance. Evaluation results show that while frontier large language models outperform academic models, they still lag behind human performance by a significant 14.3\% accuracy gap. Additionally, our pipeline creates a training dataset of 9,695 machine generated samples without manual effort, which empirical studies suggest can enhance the across-time reasoning via fine-tuning."
Poster,RFLPA: A Robust Federated Learning Framework against Poisoning Attacks with Secure Aggregation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93930,"Peihua Mai, Ran Yan, Yan Pang","Federated learning (FL) allows multiple devices to train a model collaboratively without sharing their data. Despite its benefits, FL is vulnerable to privacy leakage and poisoning attacks. To address the privacy concern, secure aggregation (SecAgg) is often used to obtain the aggregation of gradients on sever without inspecting individual user updates. Unfortunately, existing defense strategies against poisoning attacks rely on the analysis of local updates in plaintext, making them incompatible with SecAgg. To reconcile the conflicts, we propose a robust federated learning framework against poisoning attacks (RFLPA) based on SecAgg protocol. Our framework computes the cosine similarity between local updates and server updates to conduct robust aggregation. Furthermore, we leverage verifiable packed Shamir secret sharing to achieve reduced communication cost of $O(M+N)$ per user, and design a novel dot product aggregation algorithm to resolve the issue of increased information leakage. Our experimental results show that RFLPA significantly reduces communication and computation overhead by over $75\%$ compared to the state-of-the-art secret sharing method, BREA, while maintaining competitive accuracy."
Poster,RGFN: Synthesizable Molecular Generation Using GFlowNets,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94040,"Michał Koziarski, Andrei Rekesh, Dmytro Shevchuk, Almer van der Sloot, Piotr Gaiński, Yoshua Bengio, Chenghao Liu, Mike Tyers, Robert Batey","Generative models hold great promise for small molecule discovery, significantly increasing the size of search space compared to traditional in silico screening libraries. However, most existing machine learning methods for small molecule generation suffer from poor synthesizability of candidate compounds, making experimental validation difficult. In this paper we propose Reaction-GFlowNet (RGFN), an extension of the GFlowNet framework that operates directly in the space of chemical reactions, thereby allowing out-of-the-box synthesizability while maintaining comparable quality of generated candidates. We demonstrate that with the proposed set of reactions and building blocks, it is possible to obtain a search space of molecules orders of magnitude larger than existing screening libraries coupled with low cost of synthesis. We also show that the approach scales to very large fragment libraries, further increasing the number of potential molecules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across a range of oracle models, including pretrained proxy models and GPU-accelerated docking."
Poster,RGMDT: Return-Gap-Minimizing Decision Tree Extraction in Non-Euclidean Metric Space,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93745,"Jingdi Chen, Hanhan Zhou, Yongsheng Mei, Carlee Joe-Wong, Gina C. Adam, Nathaniel Bastian, Tian Lan","Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have achieved great success in solving many challenging tasks while their black-box nature hinders interpretability and real-world applicability, making it difficult for human experts to interpret and understand DRL policies. Existing works on interpretable reinforcement learning have shown promise in extracting decision tree (DT) based policies from DRL policies with most focus on the single-agent settings while prior attempts to introduce DT policies in multi-agent scenarios mainly focus on heuristic designs which do not provide any quantitative guarantees on the expected return.In this paper, we establish an upper bound on the return gap between the oracle expert policy and an optimal decision tree policy. This enables us to recast the DT extraction problem into a novel non-euclidean clustering problem over the local observation and action values space of each agent, with action values as cluster labels and the upper bound on the return gap as clustering loss.Both the algorithm and the upper bound are extended to multi-agent decentralized DT extractions by an iteratively-grow-DT procedure guided by an action-value function conditioned on the current DTs of other agents. Further, we propose the Return-Gap-Minimization Decision Tree (RGMDT) algorithm, which is a surprisingly simple design and is integrated with reinforcement learning through the utilization of a novel Regularized Information Maximization loss. Evaluations on tasks like D4RL show that RGMDT significantly outperforms heuristic DT-based baselines and can achieve nearly optimal returns under given DT complexity constraints (e.g., maximum number of DT nodes)."
Poster,RG-SAN: Rule-Guided Spatial Awareness Network for End-to-End 3D Referring Expression Segmentation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93458,"Changli Wu, qi chen, Jiayi Ji, Haowei Wang, Yiwei Ma, You Huang, Gen Luo, Hao Fei, Xiaoshuai Sun, Rongrong Ji","3D Referring Expression Segmentation (3D-RES) aims to segment 3D objects by correlating referring expressions with point clouds. However, traditional approaches frequently encounter issues like over-segmentation or mis-segmentation, due to insufficient emphasis on spatial information of instances. In this paper, we introduce a Rule-Guided Spatial Awareness Network (RG-SAN) by utilizing solely the spatial information of the target instance for supervision. This approach enables the network to accurately depict the spatial relationships among all entities described in the text, thus enhancing the reasoning capabilities. The RG-SAN consists of the Text-driven Localization Module (TLM) and the Rule-guided Weak Supervision (RWS) strategy. The TLM initially locates all mentioned instances and iteratively refines their positional information. The RWS strategy, acknowledging that only target objects have supervised positional information, employs dependency tree rules to precisely guide the core instance’s positioning. Extensive testing on the ScanRefer benchmark has shown that RG-SAN not only establishes new performance benchmarks, with an mIoU increase of 5.1 points, but also exhibits significant improvements in robustness when processing descriptions with spatial ambiguity.

Poster,Richelieu: Self-Evolving LLM-Based Agents for AI Diplomacy,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96464,"Zhenyu Guan, Xiangyu Kong, Fangwei Zhong, Yizhou Wang","Diplomacy is one of the most sophisticated activities in human society, involving complex interactions among multiple parties that require skills in social reasoning, negotiation, and long-term strategic planning. Previous AI agents have demonstrated their ability to handle multi-step games and large action spaces in multi-agent tasks. However, diplomacy involves a staggering magnitude of decision spaces, especially considering the negotiation stage required. While recent agents based on large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in various applications, they still struggle with extended planning periods in complex multi-agent settings. Leveraging recent technologies for LLM-based agents, we aim to explore AI's potential to create a human-like agent capable of executing comprehensive multi-agent missions by integrating three fundamental capabilities: 1) strategic planning with memory and reflection; 2) goal-oriented negotiation with social reasoning; and 3) augmenting memory through self-play games for self-evolution without human in the loop.
