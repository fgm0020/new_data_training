Poster,SocialGPT: Prompting LLMs for Social Relation Reasoning via Greedy Segment Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93072,"Wanhua Li, Zibin Meng, Jiawei Zhou, Donglai Wei, Chuang Gan, Hanspeter Pfister","Social relation reasoning aims to identify relation categories such as friends, spouses, and colleagues from images. While current methods adopt the paradigm of training a dedicated network end-to-end using labeled image data, they are limited in terms of generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we first present a simple yet well-crafted framework named SocialGPT, which combines the perception capability of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) within a modular framework, providing a strong baseline for social relation recognition. Specifically, we instruct VFMs to translate image content into a textual social story, and then utilize LLMs for text-based reasoning. SocialGPT introduces systematic design principles to adapt VFMs and LLMs separately and bridge their gaps. Without additional model training, it achieves competitive zero-shot results on two databases while offering interpretable answers, as LLMs can generate language-based explanations for the decisions. The manual prompt design process for LLMs at the reasoning phase is tedious and an automated prompt optimization method is desired. As we essentially convert a visual classification task into a generative task of LLMs, automatic prompt optimization encounters a unique long prompt optimization issue. To address this issue, we further propose the Greedy Segment Prompt Optimization (GSPO), which performs a greedy search by utilizing gradient information at the segment level. Experimental results show that GSPO significantly improves performance, and our method also generalizes to different image styles. The code is available at https://github.com/Mengzibin/SocialGPT."
Poster,SocraticLM: Exploring Socratic Personalized Teaching with Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93477,"Jiayu Liu, Zhenya Huang, Tong Xiao, Jing Sha, Jinze Wu, Qi Liu, Shijin Wang, Enhong Chen","Large language models (LLMs) are considered a crucial technology for advancing intelligent education since they exhibit the potential for an in-depth understanding of teaching scenarios and providing students with personalized guidance. Nonetheless, current LLM-based application in personalized teaching predominantly follows a ""Question-Answering"" paradigm, where students are passively provided with answers and explanations. In this paper, we propose SocraticLM, which achieves a Socratic ""Thought-Provoking"" teaching paradigm that fulfills the role of a real classroom teacher in actively engaging students in the thought process required for genuine problem-solving mastery. To build SocraticLM, we first propose a novel ""Dean-Teacher-Student"" multi-agent pipeline to construct a new dataset, SocraTeach, which contains $35$K meticulously crafted Socratic-style multi-round (equivalent to $208$K single-round) teaching dialogues grounded in fundamental mathematical problems. Our dataset simulates authentic teaching scenarios, interacting with six representative types of simulated students with different cognitive states, and strengthening four crucial teaching abilities. SocraticLM is then fine-tuned on SocraTeach with three strategies balancing its teaching and reasoning abilities. Moreover, we contribute a comprehensive evaluation system encompassing five pedagogical dimensions for assessing the teaching quality of LLMs. Extensive experiments verify that SocraticLM achieves significant improvements in the teaching performance, outperforming GPT4 by more than 12\%. Our dataset and code is available at https://github.com/Ljyustc/SocraticLM."
Poster,Soft ascent-descent as a stable and flexible alternative to flooding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94730,"Matthew Holland, Kosuke Nakatani","As a heuristic for improving test accuracy in classification, the ""flooding"" method proposed by Ishida et al. (2020) sets a threshold for the average surrogate loss at training time; above the threshold, gradient descent is run as usual, but below the threshold, a switch to gradient *ascent* is made. While setting the threshold is non-trivial and is usually done with validation data, this simple technique has proved remarkably effective in terms of accuracy. On the other hand, what if we are also interested in other metrics such as model complexity or average surrogate loss at test time? As an attempt to achieve better overall performance with less fine-tuning, we propose a softened, pointwise mechanism called SoftAD (soft ascent-descent) that downweights points on the borderline, limits the effects of outliers, and retains the ascent-descent effect of flooding, with no additional computational overhead. We contrast formal stationarity guarantees with those for flooding, and empirically demonstrate how SoftAD can realize classification accuracy competitive with flooding (and the more expensive alternative SAM) while enjoying a much smaller loss generalization gap and model norm."
Poster,Soft-Label Integration for Robust Toxicity Classification,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93998,"Zelei Cheng, Xian Wu, Jiahao Yu, Shuo Han, Xin-Qiang Cai, Xinyu Xing","Toxicity classification in textual content remains a significant problem. Data with labels from a single annotator fall short of capturing the diversity of human perspectives. Therefore, there is a growing need to incorporate crowdsourced annotations for training an effective toxicity classifier. Additionally, the standard approach to training a classifier using empirical risk minimization (ERM) may fail to address the potential shifts between the training set and testing set due to exploiting spurious correlations. This work introduces a novel bi-level optimization framework that integrates crowdsourced annotations with the soft-labeling technique and optimizes the soft-label weights by Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (GroupDRO) to enhance the robustness against out-of-distribution (OOD) risk. We theoretically prove the convergence of our bi-level optimization algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of both average and worst-group accuracy, confirming its effectiveness in leveraging crowdsourced annotations to achieve more effective and robust toxicity classification."
Poster,Soft Prompt Threats: Attacking Safety Alignment and Unlearning in Open-Source LLMs through the Embedding Space,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96148,"Leo Schwinn, David Dobre, Sophie Xhonneux, Gauthier Gidel, Stephan Günnemann","Current research in adversarial robustness of LLMs focuses on \textit{discrete} input manipulations in the natural language space, which can be directly transferred to \textit{closed-source} models. However, this approach neglects the steady progression of \textit{open-source} models. As open-source models advance in capability, ensuring their safety becomes increasingly imperative. Yet, attacks tailored to open-source LLMs that exploit full model access remain largely unexplored. We address this research gap and propose the \textit{embedding space attack}, which directly attacks the \textit{continuous} embedding representation of input tokens.We find that embedding space attacks circumvent model alignments and trigger harmful behaviors more efficiently than discrete attacks or model fine-tuning. Additionally, we demonstrate that models compromised by embedding attacks can be used to create discrete jailbreaks in natural language. Lastly, we present a novel threat model in the context of unlearning and show that embedding space attacks can extract supposedly deleted information from unlearned LLMs across multiple datasets and models. Our findings highlight embedding space attacks as an important threat model in open-source LLMs."
Poster,SOFTS: Efficient Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Series-Core Fusion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96390,"Han Lu, Xu-Yang Chen, Han-Jia Ye, De-Chuan Zhan","Multivariate time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various fields such as finance, traffic management, energy, and healthcare.  Recent studies have highlighted the advantages of channel independence to resist distribution drift but neglect channel correlations, limiting further enhancements. Several methods utilize mechanisms like attention or mixer to address this by capturing channel correlations, but they either introduce excessive complexity or rely too heavily on the correlation to achieve satisfactory results under distribution drifts, particularly with a large number of channels. Addressing this gap, this paper presents an efficient MLP-based model, the Series-cOre Fused Time Series forecaster (SOFTS), which incorporates a novel STar Aggregate-Redistribute (STAR) module. Unlike traditional approaches that manage channel interactions through distributed structures, \textit{e.g.}, attention, STAR employs a centralized strategy to improve efficiency and reduce reliance on the quality of each channel. It aggregates all series to form a global core representation, which is then dispatched and fused with individual series representations to facilitate channel interactions effectively. SOFTS achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods with only linear complexity. The broad applicability of the STAR module across different forecasting models is also demonstrated empirically. We have made our code publicly available at https://github.com/Secilia-Cxy/SOFTS."
Poster,Soft Superpixel Neighborhood Attention,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94453,"Kent W Gauen, Stanley Chan","Images contain objects with deformable boundaries, such as the contours of a human face, yet attention operators act on square windows. This mixes features from perceptually unrelated regions, which can degrade the quality of a denoiser. One can exclude pixels using an estimate of perceptual groupings, such as superpixels, but the naive use of superpixels can be theoretically and empirically worse than standard attention. Using superpixel probabilities rather than superpixel assignments, this paper proposes soft superpixel neighborhood attention (SNA), which interpolates between the existing neighborhood attention and the naive superpixel neighborhood attention. This paper presents theoretical results showing SNA is the optimal denoiser under a latent superpixel model. SNA outperforms alternative local attention modules on image denoising, and we compare the superpixels learned from denoising with those learned with supervision."
Poster,SOI: Scaling Down Computational Complexity by Estimating Partial States of the Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93387,"Grzegorz Stefański, Paweł Daniluk, Artur Szumaczuk, Jakub Tkaczuk","Consumer electronics used to follow the miniaturization trend described by Moore’s Law. Despite increased processing power in Microcontroller Units (MCUs), MCUs used in the smallest appliances are still not capable of running even moderately big, state-of-the-art artificial neural networks (ANNs) especially in time-sensitive scenarios. In this work, we present a novel method called Scattered Online Inference (SOI) that aims to reduce the computational complexity of ANNs. SOI leverages the continuity and seasonality of time-series data and model predictions, enabling extrapolation for processing speed improvements, particularly in deeper layers. By applying compression, SOI generates more general inner partial states of ANN, allowing skipping full model recalculation at each inference."
Poster,SolarCube: An Integrative Benchmark Dataset Harnessing Satellite and In-situ Observations for Large-scale Solar Energy Forecasting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97653,"Ruohan Li, Yiqun Xie, Xiaowei Jia, Dongdong Wang, Yanhua Li, Yingxue Zhang, Zhihao Wang, Zhili Li","Solar power is a critical source of renewable energy, offering significant potential to lower greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change. However, the cloud induced-variability of solar radiation reaching the earth’s surface presents a challenge for integrating solar power into the grid (e.g., storage and backup management). The new generation of geostationary satellites such as GOES-16 has become an important data source for large-scale and high temporal frequency solar radiation forecasting. However, no machine-learning-ready dataset has integrated geostationary satellite data with fine-grained solar radiation information to support forecasting model development and benchmarking with consistent metrics. We present SolarCube, a new ML-ready benchmark dataset for solar radiation forecasting. SolarCube covers 19 study areas distributed over multiple continents: North America, South America, Asia, and Oceania. The dataset supports short (i.e., 30 minutes to 6 hours) and long-term (i.e., day-ahead or longer) solar radiation forecasting at both point-level (i.e., specific locations of monitoring stations) and area-level, by processing and integrating data from multiple sources, including geostationary satellite images, physics-derived solar radiation, and ground station observations from different monitoring networks over the globe. We also evaluated a set of forecasting models for point- and image-based time-series data to develop performance benchmarks under different testing scenarios. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11498739. A Python library is available to conveniently generate different variations of the dataset based on user needs, along with baseline models at https://github.com/Ruohan-Li/SolarCube."
Poster,Solving Inverse Problems via Diffusion Optimal Control,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93119,"Henry Li, Marcus Pereira","Existing approaches to diffusion-based inverse problem solvers frame the signal recovery task as a probabilistic sampling episode, where the solution is drawn from the desired posterior distribution. This framework suffers from several critical drawbacks, including the intractability of the conditional likelihood function, strict dependence on the score network approximation, and poor $\mathbf{x}_0$ prediction quality. We demonstrate that these limitations can be sidestepped by reframing the generative process as a discrete optimal control episode. We derive a diffusion-based optimal controller inspired by the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) algorithm. This framework is fully general and able to handle any differentiable forward measurement operator, including super-resolution, inpainting, Gaussian deblurring, nonlinear deblurring, and even highly nonlinear neural classifiers. Furthermore, we show that the idealized posterior sampling equation can be recovered as a special case of our algorithm. We then evaluate our method against a selection of neural inverse problem solvers, and establish a new baseline in image reconstruction with inverse problems."
