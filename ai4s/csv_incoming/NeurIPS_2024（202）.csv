Poster,Inexact Augmented Lagrangian Methods for Conic Optimization: Quadratic Growth and Linear Convergence,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95084,"Feng-Yi Liao, Lijun Ding, Yang Zheng","Augmented Lagrangian Methods (ALMs) are widely employed in solving constrained optimizations, and some efficient solvers are developed based on this framework. Under the quadratic growth assumption, it is known that the dual iterates and the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) residuals of ALMs applied to conic programs converge linearly. In contrast, the convergence rate of the primal iterates has remained elusive. In this paper, we resolve this challenge by establishing new $\textit{quadratic growth}$ and $\textit{error bound}$ properties for primal and dual conic programs under the standard strict complementarity condition. Our main results reveal that both primal and dual iterates of the ALMs converge linearly contingent solely upon the assumption of strict complementarity and a bounded solution set. This finding provides a positive answer to an open question regarding the asymptotically linear convergence of the primal iterates of ALMs applied to conic optimization."
Poster,Inference of Neural Dynamics Using Switching Recurrent Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92945,"Yongxu Zhang, Shreya Saxena","Neural population activity often exhibits distinct dynamical features across time, which may correspond to distinct internal processes or behavior. Linear methods and variations thereof, such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Switching Linear Dynamical System (SLDS), are often employed to identify discrete states with evolving neural dynamics. However, these techniques may not be able to capture the underlying nonlinear dynamics associated with neural propagation. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are commonly used to model neural dynamics thanks to their nonlinear characteristics. In our work, we develop Switching Recurrent Neural Networks (SRNN), RNNs with weights that switch across time, to reconstruct switching dynamics of neural time-series data. We apply these models to simulated data as well as cortical neural activity across mice and monkeys, which allows us to automatically detect discrete states that lead to the identification of varying neural dynamics. In a monkey reaching dataset with electrophysiology recordings, a mouse self-initiated lever pull dataset with widefield calcium recordings, and a mouse self-initiated decision making dataset with widefield calcium recording, SRNNs are able to automatically identify discrete states with distinct nonlinear neural dynamics. The inferred switches are aligned with the behavior, and the reconstructions show that the recovered neural dynamics are distinct across different stages of the behavior. We show that the neural dynamics have behaviorally-relevant switches across time and we are able to use SRNNs to successfully capture these switches and the corresponding dynamical features."
Poster,Inference on the Change Point under a High Dimensional Covariance Shift,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/98303,"Abhishek Kaul, Hongjin Zhang, Konstantinos Tsampourakis, George Michailidis","We consider the problem of constructing asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the change point in a high-dimensional covariance shift setting. A novel estimator for the change point parameter is developed, and its asymptotic distribution under high dimensional scaling obtained. We establish that the proposed estimator exhibits a sharp $O_p(\psi^{-2})$ rate of convergence, wherein $\psi$ represents the jump size between model parameters before and after the change point. Further, the form of the asymptotic distributions under both a vanishing and a non-vanishing regime of the jump size are characterized. In the former case, it corresponds to the argmax of an asymmetric Brownian motion, while in the latter case to the argmax of an asymmetric random walk. We then obtain the relationship between these distributions, which allows construction of regime (vanishing vs non-vanishing) adaptive confidence intervals. Easy to implement algorithms for the proposed methodology are developed and their performance illustrated on synthetic and real data sets."
Poster,Inference via Interpolation: Contrastive Representations Provably Enable Planning and Inference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95284,"Benjamin Eysenbach, Vivek Myers, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Sergey Levine","Given time series data, how can we answer questions like ``what will happen in the future?'' and ``how did we get here?'' These sorts of probabilistic inference questions are challenging when observations are high-dimensional. In this paper, we show how these questions can have compact, closed form solutions in terms of learned representations. The key idea is to apply a variant of contrastive learning to time series data. Prior work already shows that the representations learned by contrastive learning encode a probability ratio. By extending prior work to show that the marginal distribution over representations is Gaussian, we can then prove that joint distribution of representations is also Gaussian. Taken together, these results show that representations learned via temporal contrastive learning follow a Gauss-Markov chain, a graphical model where inference (e.g., prediction, planning) over representations corresponds to inverting a low-dimensional matrix. In one special case, inferring intermediate representations will be equivalent to interpolating between the learned representations. We validate our theory using numerical simulations on tasks up to 46-dimensions."
Poster,"Infer Induced Sentiment of Comment Response to Video: A New Task, Dataset and Baseline",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97795,"qi jia, baoyu, Cong Xu, Lu Liu, Liang Jin, Guoguang Du, Zhenhua Guo, Yaqian Zhao, Xuanjing Huang, Rengang Li","Existing video multi-modal sentiment analysis mainly focuses on the sentiment expression of people within the video, yet often neglects the induced sentiment of viewers while watching the videos. Induced sentiment of viewers is essential for inferring the public response to videos and has broad application in analyzing public societal sentiment, effectiveness of advertising and other areas. The micro videos and the related comments provide a rich application scenario for viewers’ induced sentiment analysis. In light of this, we introduces a novel research task, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis for Comment Response of Video Induced(MSA-CRVI), aims to infer opinions and emotions according to comments response to micro video. Meanwhile, we manually annotate a dataset named Comment Sentiment toward to Micro Video (CSMV) to support this research. It is the largest video multi-modal sentiment dataset in terms of scale and video duration to our knowledge, containing 107, 267 comments and 8, 210 micro videos with a video duration of 68.83 hours. To infer the induced sentiment of comment should leverage the video content, we propose the Video Content-aware Comment Sentiment Analysis (VC-CSA) method as a baseline to address the challenges inherent in this new task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is showing significant improvements over other established baselines. We make the dataset and source code publicly available at https://github.com/IEIT-AGI/MSA-CRVI."
Poster,Inferring Neural Signed Distance Functions by Overfitting on Single Noisy Point Clouds through Finetuning Data-Driven based Priors,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95809,"Chao Chen, Yu-Shen Liu, Zhizhong Han","It is important to estimate an accurate signed distance function (SDF) from a point cloud in many computer vision applications. The latest methods learn neural SDFs using either a data-driven based or an overfitting-based strategy. However, these two kinds of methods are with either poor generalization or slow convergence, which limits their capability under challenging scenarios like highly noisy point clouds. To resolve this issue, we propose a method to prompt pros of both data-driven based and overfitting-based methods for better generalization, faster inference, and higher accuracy in learning neural SDFs. We introduce a novel statistical reasoning algorithm in local regions which is able to finetune data-driven based priors without signed distance supervision, clean point cloud, or point normals. This helps our method start with a good initialization, and converge to a minimum in a much faster way. Our numerical and visual comparisons with the stat-of-the-art methods show our superiority over these methods in surface reconstruction and point cloud denoising on widely used shape and scene benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/chenchao15/LocalN2NM."
Poster,Inferring stochastic low-rank recurrent neural networks from neural data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96170,"Matthijs Pals, A Erdem Sağtekin, Felix Pei, Manuel Gloeckler, Jakob H Macke","A central aim in computational neuroscience is to relate the activity of large populations of neurons to an underlying dynamical system. Models of these neural dynamics should ideally be both interpretable and fit the observed data well. Low-rank recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit such interpretability by having tractable dynamics. However, it is unclear how to best fit low-rank RNNs to data consisting of noisy observations of an underlying stochastic system. Here, we propose to fit stochastic low-rank RNNs with variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs. Our method both elucidates the dynamical systems underlying experimental recordings and provides a generative model whose trajectories match observed variability."
Poster,InfiBench: Evaluating the Question-Answering Capabilities of Code Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97797,"Linyi Li, Shijie Geng, Zhenwen Li, Yibo He, Hao Yu, Ziyue Hua, Guanghan Ning, Siwei Wang, Tao Xie, Hongxia Yang","Large Language Models for code (code LLMs) have witnessed tremendous progress in recent years. With the rapid development of code LLMs, many popular evaluation benchmarks, such as HumanEval, DS-1000, and MBPP, have emerged to measure the performance of code LLMs with a particular focus on code generation tasks. However, they are insufficient to cover the full range of expected capabilities of code LLMs, which span beyond code generation to answering diverse coding-related questions. To fill this gap, we propose InfiBench, the first large-scale freeform question-answering (QA) benchmark for code to our knowledge, comprising 234 carefully selected high-quality Stack Overflow questions that span across 15 programming languages. InfiBench uses four types of model-free automatic metrics to evaluate response correctness where domain experts carefully concretize the criterion for each question. We conduct a systematic evaluation for over 100 latest code LLMs on InfiBench, leading to a series of novel and insightful findings. Our detailed analyses showcase potential directions for further advancement of code LLMs. InfiBench is fully open source at https://infi-coder.github.io/infibench and continuously expanding to foster more scientific and systematic practices for code LLM evaluation."
Poster,Infinite-Dimensional Feature Interaction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93089,"Chenhui Xu, FUXUN YU, Maoliang Li, Zihao Zheng, Zirui Xu, Jinjun Xiong, Xiang Chen","The past neural network design has largely focused on feature \textit{representation space} dimension and its capacity scaling (e.g., width, depth), but overlooked the feature \textit{interaction space} scaling.  Recent advancements have shown shifted focus towards element-wise multiplication to facilitate higher-dimensional feature interaction space for better information transformation. Despite this progress, multiplications predominantly capture low-order interactions, thus remaining confined to a finite-dimensional interaction space. To transcend this limitation, classic kernel methods emerge as a promising solution to engage features in an infinite-dimensional space. We introduce InfiNet, a model architecture that enables feature interaction within an infinite-dimensional space created by RBF kernel. Our experiments reveal that InfiNet achieves new state-of-the-art, owing to its capability to leverage infinite-dimensional interactions, significantly enhancing model performance."
Poster,Infinite Limits of Multi-head Transformer Dynamics,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93589,"Blake Bordelon, Hamza Chaudhry, Cengiz Pehlevan","In this work we analyze various scaling limits of the training dynamics of transformer models in the feature learning regime. We identify the set of parameterizations which admit well defined infinite width and depth limits that allow the attention layers to update throughout training, a relevant notion of feature learning in these models. We then use tools from dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) to analyze various infinite limits (infinite heads, infinite key/query dimension, and infinite depth) which have different statistical descriptions depending on which infinite limit is taken and how attention layers are scaled. We provide numerical evidence of convergence to the limits and show they maintain the correct scale of updates for both SGD and Adam."
