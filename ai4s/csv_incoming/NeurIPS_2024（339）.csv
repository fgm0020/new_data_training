Poster,ReplaceAnything3D: Text-Guided Object Replacement in 3D Scenes with Compositional Scene Representations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96380,"Edward Bartrum, Thu Nguyen-Phuoc, Christopher Xie, Zhengqin Li, Numair Khan, Armen Avetisyan, Douglas Lanman, Lei Xiao","We introduce ReplaceAnything3D model RAM3D, a novel method for 3D object replacement in 3D scenes based on users' text description. Given multi-view images of a scene, a text prompt describing the object to replace, and another describing the new object, our Erase-and-Replace approach can effectively swap objects in 3D scenes with newly generated content while maintaining 3D consistency across multiple viewpoints. We demonstrate the versatility of RAM3D by applying it to various realistic 3D scene types, showcasing results of modified objects that blend in seamlessly with the scene without impacting its overall integrity."
Poster,Replay-and-Forget-Free Graph Class-Incremental Learning: A Task Profiling and Prompting Approach,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95967,"Chaoxi Niu, Guansong Pang, Ling Chen, Bing Liu","Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to continually learn a sequence of tasks, with each task consisting of a set of unique classes. Graph CIL (GCIL) follows the same setting but needs to deal with graph tasks (e.g., node classification in a graph). The key characteristic of CIL lies in the absence of task identifiers (IDs) during inference, which causes a significant challenge in separating classes from different tasks (i.e., inter-task class separation). Being able to accurately predict the task IDs can help address this issue, but it is a challenging problem. In this paper, we show theoretically that accurate task ID prediction on graph data can be achieved by a Laplacian smoothing-based graph task profiling approach, in which each graph task is modeled by a task prototype based on Laplacian smoothing over the graph. It guarantees that the task prototypes of the same graph task are nearly the same with a large smoothing step, while those of different tasks are distinct due to differences in graph structure and node attributes. Further, to avoid the catastrophic forgetting of the knowledge learned in previous graph tasks, we propose a novel graph prompting approach for GCIL which learns a small discriminative graph prompt for each task, essentially resulting in a separate classification model for each task. The prompt learning requires the training of a single graph neural network (GNN) only once on the first task, and no data replay is required thereafter, thereby obtaining a GCIL model being both replay-free and forget-free. Extensive experiments on four GCIL benchmarks show that i) our task prototype-based method can achieve 100% task ID prediction accuracy on all four datasets, ii) our GCIL model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods by at least 18% in average CIL accuracy, and iii) our model is fully free of forgetting on the four datasets."
Poster,Replicability in Learning: Geometric Partitions and KKM-Sperner Lemma,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96797,"Jason Vander Woude, Peter Dixon, A. Pavan, Jamie Radcliffe, N. V. Vinodchandran","This paper studies replicability in machine learning tasks from a geometric viewpoint. Recent works have revealed the role of geometric partitions and  Sperner's lemma (and its variations) in designing replicable learning algorithms and in establishing impossibility results.  A partition $\mathcal{P}$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ is called a $(k,\epsilon)$-secluded partition if for every $\vec{p}\in\mathbb{R}^d$, an $\varepsilon$-radius ball (with respect to the $\ell_{\infty}$ norm) centered at $\vec{p}$ intersects at most $k$ members of $\mathcal{P}$.  In relation to replicable learning, the parameter $k$ is closely related to the $\textit{list complexity}$, and the parameter $\varepsilon$ is related to the sample complexity of the replicable learner. Construction of secluded partitions with better parameters (small $k$ and large $\varepsilon$) will lead to replicable learning algorithms with small list and sample complexities. Motivated by this connection, we undertake a comprehensive study of secluded partitions and establish near-optimal relationships between $k$ and $\varepsilon$. 1.  We show that for any $(k,\epsilon)$-secluded partition where each member has at most unit measure, it must be that $k \geq(1+2\varepsilon)^d$, and consequently, for the interesting regime $k\in[2^d]$ it must be that $\epsilon\leq\frac{\log_4(k)}{d}$. 2. To complement this upper bound on $\epsilon$, we show that for each $d\in\mathbb{N}$ and each viable $k\in[2^d]$, a construction of a $(k,\epsilon)$-secluded (unit cube) partition with $\epsilon\geq\frac{\log_4(k)}{d}\cdot\frac{1}{8\log_4(d+1)}$. This establishes the optimality of $\epsilon$ within a logarithmic factor.3.  Finally, we adapt our proof techniques to obtain a new ``neighborhood'' variant of the cubical KKM lemma (or cubical Sperner's lemma): For any coloring of $[0,1]^d$ in which no color is used on opposing faces, it holds for each $\epsilon\in(0,\frac12]$ that there is a point where the open $\epsilon$-radius $\ell_\infty$-ball intersects at least $(1+\frac23\epsilon)^d$ colors. While the classical Sperner/KKM lemma guarantees the existence of a point that is ""adjacent"" to points with $(d+1)$ distinct colors, the neighborhood version guarantees the existence of a small neighborhood with  exponentially many points with distinct colors."
Poster,Replicable Uniformity Testing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93847,"Sihan Liu, Christopher Ye","Uniformity testing is arguably one of the most fundamental distribution testing problems. Given sample access to an unknown distribution $\mathbf{p}$ on $[n]$, one must decide if $\mathbf{p}$ is uniform or $\varepsilon$-far from uniform (in total variation distance). A long line of work established that uniformity testing has sample complexity $\Theta(\sqrt{n}\varepsilon^{-2})$. However, when the input distribution is neither uniform nor far from uniform, known algorithms may have highly non-replicable behavior. Consequently, if these algorithms are applied in scientific studies, they may lead to contradictory results that erode public trust in science.In this work, we revisit uniformity testing under the framework of algorithmic replicability [STOC '22], requiring the algorithm to be replicable under arbitrary distributions. While replicability typically incurs a $\rho^{-2}$ factor overhead in sample complexity, we obtain a replicable uniformity tester using only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n} \varepsilon^{-2} \rho^{-1})$ samples. To our knowledge, this is the first replicable learning algorithm with (nearly) linear dependence on $\rho$.Lastly, we consider a class of ``symmetric"" algorithms [FOCS '00] whose outputs are invariant under relabeling of the domain $[n]$, which includes all existing uniformity testers (including ours). For this natural class of algorithms, we prove a nearly matching sample complexity lower bound for replicable uniformity testing."
Poster,RepLiQA: A Question-Answering Dataset for Benchmarking LLMs on Unseen Reference Content,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97851,"Joao Monteiro, Pierre-André Noël, Étienne Marcotte, Sai Rajeswar Mudumba, Valentina Zantedeschi, David Vazquez, Nicolas Chapados, Chris Pal, Perouz Taslakian","Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of data, most of which is automatically scraped from the internet. This data includes encyclopedic documents that harbor a vast amount of general knowledge (*e.g.*, Wikipedia) but also potentially overlap with benchmark datasets used for evaluating LLMs. Consequently, evaluating models on test splits that might have leaked into the training set is prone to misleading conclusions. To foster sound evaluation of language models, we introduce a new test dataset named RepLiQA, suited for question-answering and topic retrieval tasks. RepLiQA is a collection of five splits of test sets, four of which have not been released to the internet or exposed to LLM APIs prior to this publication. Each sample in RepLiQA comprises (1) a reference document crafted by a human annotator and depicting an imaginary scenario (*e.g.*, a news article) absent from the internet; (2) a question about the document’s topic; (3) a ground-truth answer derived directly from the information in the document; and (4) the paragraph extracted from the reference document containing the answer. As such, accurate answers can only be generated if a model can find relevant content within the provided document. We run a large-scale benchmark comprising several state-of-the-art LLMs to uncover differences in performance across models of various types and sizes in a context-conditional language modeling setting. Released splits of RepLiQA can be found here: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ServiceNow/repliqa."
Poster,Representation Noising: A Defence Mechanism Against Harmful Finetuning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94272,"Domenic Rosati, Jan Wehner, Kai Williams, Lukasz Bartoszcze, Robie Gonzales, carsten maple, Subhabrata Majumdar, Hassan Sajjad, Frank Rudzicz","Releasing open-source large language models (LLMs) presents a dual-use risk since bad actors can easily fine-tune these models for harmful purposes. Even without the open release of weights, weight stealing and fine-tuning APIs make closed models vulnerable to harmful fine-tuning attacks (HFAs). While safety measures like preventing jailbreaks and improving safety guardrails are important, such measures can easily be reversed through fine-tuning. In this work, we propose Representation Noising (\textsf{\small RepNoise}), a defence mechanism that operates even when attackers have access to the weights. \textsf{\small RepNoise} works by removing information about harmful representations such that it is difficult to recover them during fine-tuning. Importantly, our defence is also able to generalize across different subsets of harm that have not been seen during the defence process as long as they are drawn from the same distribution of the attack set. Our method does not degrade the general capability of LLMs and retains the ability to train the model on harmless tasks. We provide empirical evidence that the efficacy of our defence lies in its ``depth'': the degree to which information about harmful representations is removed across {\em all layers} of the LLM. We also find areas where \textsf{\small RepNoise} still remains ineffective and highlight how those limitations can inform future research."
Poster,Reproducibility of predictive networks for mouse visual cortex,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94888,"Polina Turishcheva, Max Burg, Fabian Sinz, Alexander Ecker","Deep predictive models of neuronal activity have recently enabled several new discoveries about the selectivity and invariance of neurons in the visual cortex.These models learn a shared set of nonlinear basis functions, which are linearly combined via a learned weight vector to represent a neuron's function.Such weight vectors, which can be thought as embeddings of neuronal function, have been proposed to define functional cell types via unsupervised clustering.However, as deep models are usually highly overparameterized, the learning problem is unlikely to have a unique solution, which raises the question if such embeddings can be used in a meaningful way for downstream analysis.In this paper, we investigate how stable neuronal embeddings are with respect to changes in model architecture and initialization. We find that $L_1$ regularization to be an important ingredient for structured embeddings and develop an adaptive regularization that adjusts the strength of regularization per neuron.  This regularization improves both predictive performance and how consistently neuronal embeddings cluster across model fits  compared to uniform regularization.To overcome overparametrization, we propose an iterative feature pruning strategy which reduces the dimensionality of performance-optimized models by half without loss of performance and improves the consistency of neuronal embeddings with respect to clustering neurons.Our results suggest that to achieve an objective taxonomy of cell types or a compact representation of the functional landscape, we need novel architectures or learning techniques that improve identifiability.

Poster,Reproducibility Study: Equal Improvability: A New Fairness Notion Considering the Long-Term Impact,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/99346,"Berkay Chakar, Amina Izbassar, Mina Janićijević, Jakub Tomaszewski","This reproducibility study aims to evaluate the robustness of Equal Improvability (EI) - an effort-based framework for ensuring long-term fairness. To this end, we seek to analyze the three proposed EI-ensuring regularization techniques, i.e. Covariance-based, KDE-based, and Loss-based EI. Our findings largely substantiate the initial assertions, demonstrating EI’s enhanced performance over Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) techniques on various test datasets. Furthermore, while affirming the long-term effectiveness in fairness, the study also uncovers challenges in resilience to overfitting, particularly in highly complex models.
Building upon the original study, the experiments were extended to include a new dataset and multiple sensitive attributes. These additional tests further demonstrated the effec- tiveness of the EI approach, reinforcing its continued success. Our study highlights the importance of adaptable strategies in AI fairness, contributing to the ongoing discourse in this field of research."
Poster,Reproducibility study of FairAC,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/99333,"Gijs de Jong, Macha Meijer, Derck Prinzhorn, Harold Ruiter","This work aims to reproduce the findings of the paper ""Fair Attribute Completion on Graph with Missing Attributes"" written by Guo et al. (2023) by investigating the claims made in the paper. This paper suggests that the results of the original paper are reproducible and thus, the claims hold. However, the claim that FairAC is a generic framework for many downstream tasks is very broad and could therefore only be partially tested. Moreover, we show that FairAC is generalizable to various datasets and sensitive attributes and show evidence that the improvement in group fairness of the FairAC framework does not come at the expense of individual fairness. Lastly, the codebase of FairAC has been refactored and is now easily applicable for various datasets and models."
Poster,"Reproducibility Study of ""ITI-GEN: Inclusive Text-to-Image Generation""",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/99338,"Daniel Gallo Fernández, Răzvan-Andrei Matișan, Alejandro Monroy, Janusz Partyka","Text-to-image generative models often present issues regarding fairness with respect to certain sensitive attributes, such as gender or skin tone. This study aims to reproduce the results presented in ""ITI-GEN: Inclusive Text-to-Image Generation"" by Zhang et al. (2023), which introduces a model to improve inclusiveness in these kinds of models. We show that most of the claims made by the authors about ITI-GEN hold: it improves the diversity and quality of generated images, it is scalable to different domains, it has plug-and-play capabilities, and it is efficient from a computational point of view. However, ITI-GEN sometimes uses undesired attributes as proxy features and it is unable to disentangle some pairs of (correlated) attributes such as gender and baldness. In addition, when the number of considered attributes increases, the training time grows exponentially and ITI-GEN struggles to generate inclusive images for all elements in the joint distribution. To solve these issues, we propose using Hard Prompt Search with negative prompting, a method that does not require training and that handles negation better than vanilla Hard Prompt Search. Nonetheless, Hard Prompt Search (with or without negative prompting) cannot be used for continuous attributes that are hard to express in natural language, an area where ITI-GEN excels as it is guided by images during training. Finally, we propose combining ITI-GEN and Hard Prompt Search with negative prompting."
