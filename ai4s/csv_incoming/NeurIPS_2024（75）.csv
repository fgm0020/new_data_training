Poster,Compositional Automata Embeddings for Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96533,"Beyazit Yalcinkaya, Niklas Lauffer, Marcell Vazquez-Chanlatte, Sanjit Seshia","Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning is a powerful way to control an AI agent's behavior at runtime. That said, popular goal representations, e.g., target states or natural language, are either limited to Markovian tasks or rely on ambiguous task semantics. We propose representing temporal goals using compositions of deterministic finite automata (cDFAs) and use cDFAs to guide RL agents. cDFAs balance the need for formal temporal semantics with ease of interpretation: if one can understand a flow chart, one can understand a cDFA. On the other hand, cDFAs form a countably infinite concept class with Boolean semantics, and subtle changes to the automaton can result in very different tasks, making them difficult to condition agent behavior on. To address this, we observe that all paths through a DFA correspond to a series of reach-avoid tasks and propose pre-training graph neural network embeddings on ""reach-avoid derived"" DFAs. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed pre-training method enables zero-shot generalization to various cDFA task classes and accelerated policy specialization without the myopic suboptimality of hierarchical methods."
Poster,Compositional Generalization Across Distributional Shifts with Sparse Tree Operations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94209,"Paul Soulos, Henry Conklin, Mattia Opper, Paul Smolensky, Jianfeng Gao, Roland Fernandez","Neural networks continue to struggle with compositional generalization, and this issue is exacerbated by a lack of massive pre-training. One successful approach for developing neural systems which exhibit human-like compositional generalization is $\textit{hybrid}$ neurosymbolic techniques. However, these techniques run into the core issues that plague symbolic approaches to AI: scalability and flexibility. The reason for this failure is that at their core, hybrid neurosymbolic models perform symbolic computation and relegate the scalable and flexible neural computation to parameterizing a symbolic system. We investigate a $\textit{unified}$ neurosymbolic system where transformations in the network can be interpreted simultaneously as both symbolic and neural computation. We extend a unified neurosymbolic architecture called the Differentiable Tree Machine in two central ways. First, we significantly increase the model’s efficiency through the use of sparse vector representations of symbolic structures. Second, we enable its application beyond the restricted set of tree2tree problems to the more general class of seq2seq problems. The improved model retains its prior generalization capabilities and, since there is a fully neural path through the network, avoids the pitfalls of other neurosymbolic techniques that elevate symbolic computation over neural computation."
Poster,Compositional PAC-Bayes: Generalization of GNNs with persistence and beyond,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94640,"Kirill Brilliantov, Amauri Souza, Vikas Garg","Heterogeneity, e.g., due to different types of layers or multiple sub-models, poses key challenges in analyzing the generalization behavior of several modern architectures. For instance, descriptors based on Persistent Homology (PH) are being increasingly integrated into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to augment them with rich topological features; however, the generalization of such PH schemes remains unexplored. We introduce a novel _compositional_ PAC-Bayes framework that provides a general recipe to analyze a broad spectrum of models including those with heterogeneous layers. Specifically, we provide the first data-dependent generalization bounds for a widely adopted PH vectorization scheme (that subsumes persistence landscapes, images, and silhouettes) as well as PH-augmented GNNs. Using our framework, we also obtain bounds for GNNs and neural nets with ease. Our bounds also inform the design of novel regularizers. Empirical evaluations on several standard real-world datasets demonstrate that our theoretical bounds highly correlate with empirical generalization performance, leading to improved classifier design via our regularizers. Overall, this work bridges a crucial gap in the theoretical understanding of PH methods and general heterogeneous models, paving the way for the design of better models for (graph) representation learning.

Poster,Compressing Large Language Models using Low Rank and Low Precision Decomposition,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93805,"Rajarshi Saha, Naomi Sagan, Varun Srivastava, Andrea Goldsmith, Mert Pilanci","The prohibitive sizes of Large Language Models (LLMs) today make it difficult to deploy them on memory-constrained edge devices. This work introduces $\rm CALDERA$ -- a new post-training LLM compression algorithm that harnesses the inherent low-rank structure of a weight matrix $\mathbf{W}$ by approximating it via a low-rank, low-precision decomposition as $\mathbf{W} \approx \mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R}$. Here, $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ are low rank factors, and the entries of $\mathbf{Q}$, $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ are quantized. The model is compressed by substituting each layer with its $\mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R}$ decomposition, and the zero-shot performance of the compressed model is evaluated. Additionally, $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ are readily amenable to low-rank adaptation, consequently enhancing the zero-shot performance. $\rm CALDERA$ obtains this decomposition by formulating it as an optimization problem $\min_{\mathbf{Q},\mathbf{L},\mathbf{R}}\lVert(\mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R} - \mathbf{W})\mathbf{X}^\top\rVert_{\rm F}^2$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is the calibration data, and $\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{L}, \mathbf{R}$ are constrained to be representable using low-precision formats. Theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error of $\rm CALDERA$ are established using a rank-constrained regression framework, and the tradeoff between compression ratio and model performance is studied by analyzing the impact of target rank and quantization bit budget. Results illustrate that compressing LlaMa-$2$ $7$B/$13$B/$70$B and LlaMa-$3$ $8$B models obtained using $\rm CALDERA$ outperforms existing post-training LLM compression techniques in the regime of less than $2.5$ bits per parameter."
Poster,Computational Aspects of Bayesian Persuasion under Approximate Best Response,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96322,"Kunhe Yang, Hanrui Zhang","We study Bayesian persuasion under approximate best response, where the receiver may choose any action that is not too much suboptimal, given their posterior belief upon receiving the signal.  We focus on the computational aspects of the problem, aiming to design algorithms that efficiently compute (almost) optimal strategies for the sender.  Despite the absence of the revelation principle --- which has been one of the most powerful tools in Bayesian persuasion --- we design polynomial-time exact algorithms for the problem when either the state space or the action space is small, as well as a quasi-polynomial-time approximation scheme (QPTAS) for the general problem.  On the negative side, we show there is no polynomial-time exact algorithm for the general problem unless $\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}$.  Our results build on several new algorithmic ideas, which might be useful in other principal-agent problems where robustness is desired."
Poster,Computation-Aware Gaussian Processes: Model Selection And Linear-Time Inference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93350,"Jonathan Wenger, Kaiwen Wu, Philipp Hennig, Jacob Gardner, Geoff Pleiss, John Cunningham","Model selection in Gaussian processes scales prohibitively with the size of the training dataset, both in time and memory.While many approximations exist, all incur inevitable approximation error.Recent work accounts for this error in the form of computational uncertainty, which enables---at the cost of quadratic complexity---an explicit tradeoff between computational efficiency and precision.Here we extend this development to model selection, which requires significant enhancements to the existing approach, including linear-time scaling in the size of the dataset.We propose a novel training loss for hyperparameter optimization and demonstrate empirically that the resulting method can outperform SGPR, CGGP and SVGP, state-of-the-art methods for GP model selection, on medium to large-scale datasets.Our experiments show that model selection for computation-aware GPs trained on 1.8 million data points can be done within a few hours on a single GPU.As a result of this work, Gaussian processes can be trained on large-scale datasets without significantly compromising their ability to quantify uncertainty---a fundamental prerequisite for optimal decision-making."
Poster,Computerized Adaptive Testing via Collaborative Ranking,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96601,"Zirui Liu, Yan Zhuang, Qi Liu, Jiatong Li, Yuren Zhang, Zhenya Huang, Jinze Wu, Shijin Wang","As the deep integration of machine learning and intelligent education, Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) has received more and more research attention. Compared to traditional paper-and-pencil tests, CAT can deliver both personalized and interactive assessments by automatically adjusting testing questions according to the performance of students during the test process. Therefore, CAT has been recognized as an efficient testing methodology capable of accurately estimating a student’s ability with a minimal number of questions, leading to its widespread adoption in mainstream selective exams such as the GMAT and GRE. However, just improving the accuracy of ability estimation is far from satisfactory in the real-world scenarios, since an accurate ranking of students is usually more important (e.g., in high-stakes exams). Considering the shortage of existing CAT solutions in student ranking, this paper emphasizes the importance of aligning test outcomes (student ranks) with the true underlying abilities of students. Along this line, different from the conventional independent testing paradigm among students, we propose a novel collaborative framework, Collaborative Computerized Adaptive Testing (CCAT), that leverages inter-student information to enhance student ranking. By using collaborative students as anchors to assist in ranking test-takers, CCAT can give both theoretical guarantees and experimental validation for ensuring ranking consistency."
Poster,Computing the Bias of Constant-step Stochastic Approximation with Markovian Noise,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95139,"Sebastian Allmeier, Nicolas Gast","We study stochastic approximation algorithms with Markovian noise and constant step-size $\alpha$. We develop a method based on infinitesimal generator comparisons to study the bias of the algorithm, which is the expected difference between $\theta_n$ ---the value at iteration $n$--- and $\theta^*$ ---the unique equilibrium of the corresponding ODE. We show that, under some smoothness conditions, this bias is of order $O(\alpha)$. Furthermore, we show that the time-averaged bias is equal to $\alpha V + O(\alpha^2)$, where $V$ is a constant characterized by a Lyapunov equation, showing that $E[\bar{\theta}_n] \approx \theta^*+V\alpha + O(\alpha^2)$, where $\bar{\theta}_n$ is the Polyak-Ruppert average.  We also show that $\bar{\theta}_n$ converges with high probability around $\theta^*+\alpha V$. We illustrate how to combine this with Richardson-Romberg extrapolation to derive an iterative scheme with a bias of order $O(\alpha^2)$."
Poster,Con4m: Context-aware Consistency Learning Framework for Segmented Time Series Classification,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93973,"Junru Chen, Tianyu Cao, Jing Xu, Jiahe Li, Zhilong Chen, Tao Xiao, YANG YANG","Time Series Classification (TSC) encompasses two settings: classifying entire sequences or classifying segmented subsequences. The raw time series for segmented TSC usually contain Multiple classes with Varying Duration of each class (MVD). Therefore, the characteristics of MVD pose unique challenges for segmented TSC, yet have been largely overlooked by existing works. Specifically, there exists a natural temporal dependency between consecutive instances (segments) to be classified within MVD. However, mainstream TSC models rely on the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), focusing on independently modeling each segment. Additionally, annotators with varying expertise may provide inconsistent boundary labels, leading to unstable performance of noise-free TSC models. To address these challenges, we first formally demonstrate that valuable contextual information enhances the discriminative power of classification instances. Leveraging the contextual priors of MVD at both the data and label levels, we propose a novel consistency learning framework Con4m, which effectively utilizes contextual information more conducive to discriminating consecutive segments in segmented TSC tasks, while harmonizing inconsistent boundary labels for training. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of Con4m in handling segmented TSC tasks on MVD. The source code is available at https://github.com/MrNobodyCali/Con4m."
Poster,Concentrate Attention: Towards Domain-Generalizable Prompt Optimization for Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94612,"Chengzhengxu Li, Xiaoming Liu, Zhaohan Zhang, Yichen Wang, Chen Liu, Yu Lan, Chao Shen","Recent advances in prompt optimization have notably enhanced the performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) on downstream tasks. However, the potential of optimized prompts on domain generalization has been under-explored. To explore the nature of prompt generalization on unknown domains, we conduct pilot experiments and find that (i) Prompts gaining more attention weight from PLMs’ deep layers are more generalizable and (ii) Prompts with more stable attention distributions in PLMs’ deep layers are more generalizable. Thus, we offer a fresh objective towards domain-generalizable prompts optimization named ''Concentration'', which represents the ''lookback'' attention from the current decoding token to the prompt tokens, to increase the attention strength on prompts and reduce the fluctuation of attention distribution.We adapt this new objective to popular soft prompt and hard prompt optimization methods, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our idea improves comparison prompt optimization methods by 1.42% for soft prompt generalization and 2.16% for hard prompt generalization in accuracy on the multi-source domain generalization setting, while maintaining satisfying in-domain performance. The promising results validate the effectiveness of our proposed prompt optimization objective and provide key insights into domain-generalizable prompts."
