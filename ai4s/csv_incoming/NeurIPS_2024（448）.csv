Poster,When is Multicalibration Post-Processing Necessary?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95377,"Dutch Hansen, Siddartha Devic, Preetum Nakkiran, Vatsal Sharan","Calibration is a well-studied property of predictors which guarantees meaningful uncertainty estimates. Multicalibration is a related notion --- originating in algorithmic fairness --- which requires predictors to be simultaneously calibrated over a potentially complex and overlapping collection of protected subpopulations (such as groups defined by ethnicity, race, or income). We conduct the first comprehensive study evaluating the usefulness of multicalibration post-processing across a broad set of tabular, image, and language datasets for models spanning from simple decision trees to 90 million parameter fine-tuned LLMs. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (1) models which are calibrated out of the box tend to be relatively multicalibrated without any additional post-processing; (2) multicalibration can help inherently uncalibrated models and also large vision and language models; and (3) traditional calibration measures may sometimes provide multicalibration implicitly. More generally, we also distill many independent observations which may be useful for practical and effective applications of multicalibration post-processing in real-world contexts."
Poster,When LLM Meets DRL: Advancing Jailbreaking Efficiency via DRL-guided Search,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95953,"Xuan Chen, Yuzhou Nie, Wenbo Guo, Xiangyu Zhang","Recent studies developed jailbreaking attacks, which construct jailbreaking prompts to ""fool"" LLMs into responding to harmful questions.Early-stage jailbreaking attacks require access to model internals or significant human efforts. More advanced attacks utilize genetic algorithms for automatic and black-box attacks.However, the random nature of genetic algorithms significantly limits the effectiveness of these attacks.In this paper, we propose RLbreaker, a black-box jailbreaking attack driven by deep reinforcement learning (DRL).We model jailbreaking as a search problem and design an RL agent to guide the search, which is more effective and has less randomness than stochastic search, such as genetic algorithms.Specifically, we design a customized DRL system for the jailbreaking problem, including a novel reward function and a customized proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm.Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RLbreaker is much more effective than existing jailbreaking attacks against six state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. We also show that RLbreaker is robust against three SOTA defenses and its trained agents can transfer across different LLMs.We further validate the key design choices of RLbreaker via a comprehensive ablation study."
Poster,When LLMs Meet Cunning Texts: A Fallacy Understanding Benchmark for Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97757,"Yinghui Li, Qingyu Zhou, Yuanzhen Luo, Shirong Ma, Yangning Li, Hai-Tao Zheng, Xuming Hu, Philip S Yu","Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) make remarkable evolutions in language understanding and generation. Following this, various benchmarks for measuring all kinds of capabilities of LLMs have sprung up. In this paper, we challenge the reasoning and understanding abilities of LLMs by proposing a FaLlacy Understanding Benchmark (FLUB) containing cunning texts that are easy for humans to understand but difficult for models to grasp. Specifically, the cunning texts that FLUB focuses on mainly consist of the tricky, humorous, and misleading texts collected from the real internet environment. And we design three tasks with increasing difficulty in the FLUB benchmark to evaluate the fallacy understanding ability of LLMs. Based on FLUB, we investigate the performance of multiple representative and advanced LLMs, reflecting our FLUB is challenging and worthy of more future study. Interesting discoveries and valuable insights are achieved in our extensive experiments and detailed analyses. We hope that our benchmark can encourage the community to improve LLMs' ability to understand fallacies. Our data and codes are available at https://github.com/THUKElab/FLUB."
Poster,When to Act and When to Ask: Policy Learning With Deferral Under Hidden Confounding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93323,"Marah Ghoummaid, Uri Shalit","We consider the task of learning how to act in collaboration with a human expert based on observational data. The task is motivated by high-stake scenarios such as healthcare and welfare where algorithmic action recommendations are made to a human expert, opening the option of deferring making a recommendation in cases where the human might act better on their own.    This task is especially challenging when dealing with observational data, as using such data runs the risk of hidden confounders whose existence can lead to biased and harmful policies. However, unlike standard policy learning, the presence of a human expert can mitigate some of these risks. We build on the work of Mozannar and Sontag (2020) on consistent surrogate loss for learning with the option of deferral to an expert, where they solve a cost-sensitive supervised classification problem. Since we are solving a causal problem, where labels don’t exist, we use a causal model to learn costs which are robust to a bounded degree of hidden confounding.    We prove that our approach can take advantage of the strengths of both the model and the expert to obtain a better policy than either. We demonstrate our results by conducting experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic data and show the advantages of our method compared to baselines."
Poster,When to Sense and Control? A Time-adaptive Approach for Continuous-Time RL,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96939,"Lenart Treven, Bhavya, Yarden As, Florian Dorfler, Andreas Krause","Reinforcement learning (RL) excels in optimizing policies for discrete-time Markov decision processes (MDP). However, various systems are inherently continuous in time, making discrete-time MDPs an inexact modeling choice. In many applications, such as greenhouse control or medical treatments, each interaction (measurement or switching of action) involves manual intervention and thus is inherently costly. Therefore, we generally prefer a time-adaptive approach with fewer interactions with the system.In this work, we formalize an RL framework, **T**ime-**a**daptive **Co**ntrol \& **S**ensing (**TaCoS**), that tackles this challenge by optimizing over policies that besides control predict the duration of its application. Our formulation results in an extended MDP that any standard RL algorithm can solve.We demonstrate that state-of-the-art RL algorithms trained on TaCoS drastically reduce the interaction amount over their discrete-time counterpart while retaining the same or improved performance, and exhibiting robustness over discretization frequency.Finally, we propose OTaCoS, an efficient model-based algorithm for our setting. We show that OTaCoS enjoys sublinear regret for systems with sufficiently smooth dynamics and empirically results in further sample-efficiency gains."
Poster,When Your AIs Deceive You: Challenges of Partial Observability in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94754,"Leon Lang, Davis Foote, Stuart J Russell, Anca Dragan, Erik Jenner, Scott Emmons","Past analyses of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) assume that the human evaluators fully observe the environment. What happens when human feedback is based only on partial observations? We formally define two failure cases: deceptive inflation and overjustification. Modeling the human as Boltzmann-rational w.r.t. a belief over trajectories, we prove conditions under which RLHF is guaranteed to result in policies that deceptively inflate their performance, overjustify their behavior to make an impression, or both. Under the new assumption that the human's partial observability is known and accounted for, we then analyze how much information the feedback process provides about the return function. We show that sometimes, the human's feedback determines the return function uniquely up to an additive constant, but in other realistic cases, there is irreducible ambiguity. We propose exploratory research directions to help tackle these challenges and experimentally validate both the theoretical concerns and potential mitigations, and caution against blindly applying RLHF in partially observable settings."
Poster,Where does In-context Learning Happen in Large Language Models?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95599,"Suzanna Sia, David Mueller, Kevin Duh","Self-supervised large language models have demonstrated the ability to perform various tasks via in-context learning, but little is known about where the model locates the task with respect to prompt instructions and demonstration examples. In this work, we attempt to characterize the region where large language models transition from recognizing the task to performing the task. Through a series of layer-wise context-masking experiments on GPTNeo2.7B, Bloom3B, Starcoder2-7B, Llama3.1-8B, Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, on Machine Translation and Code generation, we demonstrate evidence of a ""task recognition"" point where the task is encoded into the input representations and attention to context is no longer necessary. Taking advantage of this redundancy results in 45% computational savings when prompting with 5 examples, and task recognition achieved at layer 14 / 32 using an example with Machine Translation. Our findings also have implications for resource and parameter efficient fine-tuning; we observe a correspondence between strong fine-tuning performance of individual LoRA layers and the task recognition layers."
Poster,Where Do Large Learning Rates Lead Us?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95929,"Ildus Sadrtdinov, Maxim Kodryan, Eduard Pokonechny, Ekaterina Lobacheva, Dmitry Vetrov","It is generally accepted that starting neural networks training with large learning rates (LRs) improves generalization. Following a line of research devoted to understanding this effect, we conduct an empirical study in a controlled setting focusing on two questions: 1) how large an initial LR is required for obtaining optimal quality, and 2) what are the key differences between models trained with different LRs? We discover that only a narrow range of initial LRs slightly above the convergence threshold lead to optimal results after fine-tuning with a small LR or weight averaging. By studying the local geometry of reached minima, we observe that using LRs from this optimal range allows for the optimization to locate a basin that only contains high-quality minima. Additionally, we show that these initial LRs result in a sparse set of learned features, with a clear focus on those most relevant for the task. In contrast, starting training with too small LRs leads to unstable minima and attempts to learn all features simultaneously, resulting in poor generalization. Conversely, using initial LRs that are too large fails to detect a basin with good solutions and extract meaningful patterns from the data."
Poster,Where's Waldo: Diffusion Features For Personalized Segmentation and Retrieval,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95609,"Dvir Samuel, Rami Ben-Ari, Matan Levy, Nir Darshan, Gal Chechik","Personalized retrieval and segmentation aim to locate specific instances within a dataset based on an input image and a short description of the reference instance. While supervised methods are effective, they require extensive labeled data for training. Recently, self-supervised foundation models have been introduced to these tasks showing comparable results to supervised methods. However, a significant flaw in these models is evident: they struggle to locate a desired instance when other instances within the same class are presented. In this paper, we explore text-to-image diffusion models for these tasks. Specifically, we propose a novel approach called PDM for Personalized Diffusion Features Matching, that leverages intermediate features of pre-trained text-to-image models for personalization tasks without any additional training. PDM demonstrates superior performance on popular retrieval and segmentation benchmarks, outperforming even supervised methods. We also highlight notable shortcomings in current instance and segmentation datasets and propose new benchmarks for these tasks."
Poster,WhodunitBench: Evaluating Large Multimodal Agents via Murder Mystery Games,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97492,"Junlin Xie, Ruifei Zhang, Zhihong Chen, Xiang Wan, Guanbin Li","Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved superior performance, empowering the development of large multimodal agents (LMAs). An LMA is anticipated to execute practical tasks requires various capabilities including multimodal perception, interaction, reasoning, and decision making. However, existing benchmarks are limited in assessing compositional skills and actions demanded by practical scenarios, where they primarily focused on single tasks and static scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce WhodunitBench, a benchmark rooted from murder mystery games, where players are required to utilize the aforementioned skills to achieve their objective (i.e., identifying the `murderer' or hiding themselves), providing a simulated dynamic environment for evaluating LMAs. Specifically, WhodunitBench includes two evaluation modes. The first mode, the arena-style evaluation, is constructed from 50 meticulously curated scripts featuring clear reasoning clues and distinct murderers; The second mode, the chain of evaluation, consists of over 3000 curated multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions, aiming to assess every facet of the murder mystery games for LMAs. Experiments show that although current LMAs show acceptable performance in basic perceptual tasks, they are insufficiently equipped for complex multi-agent collaboration and multi-step reasoning tasks. Furthermore, the full application of the theory of mind to complete games in a manner akin to human behavior remains a significant challenge. We hope this work can illuminate the path forward, providing a solid foundation for the future development of LMAs.
