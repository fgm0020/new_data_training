Poster,Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning via Energy-Based Normalizing Flow,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93807,"Chen-Hao Chao, Chien Feng, Wei-Fang Sun, Cheng-Kuang Lee, Simon See, Chun-Yi Lee","Existing Maximum-Entropy (MaxEnt) Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods for continuous action spaces are typically formulated based on actor-critic frameworks and optimized through alternating steps of policy evaluation and policy improvement. In the policy evaluation steps, the critic is updated to capture the soft Q-function. In the policy improvement steps, the actor is adjusted in accordance with the updated soft Q-function. In this paper, we introduce a new MaxEnt RL framework modeled using Energy-Based Normalizing Flows (EBFlow). This framework integrates the policy evaluation steps and the policy improvement steps, resulting in a single objective training process. Our method enables the calculation of the soft value function used in the policy evaluation target without Monte Carlo approximation. Moreover, this design supports the modeling of multi-modal action distributions while facilitating efficient action sampling. To evaluate the performance of our method, we conducted experiments on the MuJoCo benchmark suite and a number of high-dimensional robotic tasks simulated by Omniverse Isaac Gym. The evaluation results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to widely-adopted representative baselines."
Poster,MC-DiT: Contextual Enhancement via Clean-to-Clean Reconstruction for Masked Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93037,"Guanghao Zheng, Yuchen Liu, Wenrui Dai, Chenglin Li, Junni Zou, Hongkai Xiong","Diffusion Transformer (DiT) is emerging as a cutting-edge trend in the landscape of generative diffusion models for image generation. Recently, masked-reconstruction strategies have been considered to improve the efficiency and semantic consistency in training DiT but suffer from deficiency in contextual information extraction. In this paper, we provide a new insight to reveal that noisy-to-noisy masked-reconstruction harms sufficient utilization of contextual information. We further demonstrate the insight with theoretical analysis and empirical study on the mutual information between unmasked and masked patches. Guided by such insight, we propose a novel training paradigm named MC-DiT for fully learning contextual information via diffusion denoising at different noise variances with clean-to-clean mask-reconstruction. Moreover, to avoid model collapse, we design two complementary branches of DiT decoders for enhancing the use of noisy patches and mitigating excessive reliance on clean patches in reconstruction. Extensive experimental results on 256$\times$256 and 512$\times$512 image generation on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that the proposed MC-DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional and conditional image generation with enhanced convergence speed."
Poster,MDAgents: An Adaptive Collaboration of LLMs for Medical Decision-Making,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96041,"Yubin Kim, Chanwoo Park, Hyewon Jeong, Yik Siu Chan, Xuhai &quot;Orson&quot; Xu, Daniel McDuff, Hyeonhoon Lee, Marzyeh Ghassemi, Cynthia Breazeal, Hae Park","Foundation models are becoming valuable tools in medicine. Yet despite their promise, the best way to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex medical tasks remains an open question. We introduce a novel multi-agent framework, named **M**edical **D**ecision-making **Agents** (**MDAgents**) that helps to address this gap by automatically assigning a collaboration structure to a team of LLMs. The assigned solo or group collaboration structure is tailored to the medical task at hand, a simple emulation inspired by the way real-world medical decision-making processes are adapted to tasks of different complexities. We evaluate our framework and baseline methods using state-of-the-art LLMs across a suite of real-world medical knowledge and clinical diagnosis benchmarks, including a comparison ofLLMs’ medical complexity classification against human physicians. MDAgents achieved the **best performance in seven out of ten** benchmarks on tasks requiring an understanding of medical knowledge and multi-modal reasoning, showing a significant **improvement of up to 4.2\%** ($p$ < 0.05) compared to previous methods' best performances. Ablation studies reveal that MDAgents effectively determines medical complexity to optimize for efficiency and accuracy across diverse medical tasks. Notably, the combination of moderator review and external medical knowledge in group collaboration resulted in an average accuracy **improvement of 11.8\%**. Our code can be found at https://github.com/mitmedialab/MDAgents."
Poster,Mean-Field Analysis for Learning Subspace-Sparse Polynomials with Gaussian Input,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93247,"Ziang Chen, Rong Ge","In this work, we study the mean-field flow for learning subspace-sparse polynomials using stochastic gradient descent and two-layer neural networks, where the input distribution is standard Gaussian and the output only depends on the projection of the input onto a low-dimensional subspace. We establish a necessary condition for SGD-learnability, involving both the characteristics of the target function and the expressiveness of the activation function. In addition, we prove that the condition is almost sufficient, in the sense that a condition slightly stronger than the necessary condition can guarantee the exponential decay of the loss functional to zero."
Poster,Mean-Field Langevin Dynamics for Signed Measures via a Bilevel Approach,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95349,"Guillaume Wang, Alireza Mousavi-Hosseini, Lénaïc Chizat","Mean-field Langevin dynamics (MLFD) is a class of interacting particle methods that tackle convex optimization over probability measures on a manifold, which are scalable, versatile, and enjoy computational guarantees. However, some important problems -- such as risk minimization for infinite width two-layer neural networks, or sparse deconvolution -- are originally defined over the set of signed, rather than probability, measures. In this paper, we investigate how to extend the MFLD framework to convex optimization problems over signed measures.Among two known reductions from signed to probability measures -- the lifting and the bilevel approaches -- we show that the bilevel reduction leads to stronger guarantees and faster rates (at the price of a higher per-iteration complexity).In particular, we investigate the convergence rate of MFLD applied to the bilevel reduction in the low-noise regime and obtain two results. First, this dynamics is amenable to an annealing schedule, adapted from [Suzuki et al., 2023], that results in polynomial convergence rates to a fixed multiplicative accuracy. Second, we investigate the problem of learning a single neuron with the bilevel approach and obtain local exponential convergence rates that depend polynomially on the dimension and noise level (to compare with the exponential dependence that would result from prior analyses)."
Poster,Meaningful Learning: Enhancing Abstract Reasoning in Large Language Models via Generic Fact Guidance,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95043,"Kai Xiong, Xiao Ding, Ting Liu, Bing Qin, Dongliang Xu, Qing Yang, Hongtao Liu, Yixin Cao","Large language models (LLMs) have developed impressive performance and strong explainability across various reasoning scenarios, marking a significant stride towards mimicking human-like intelligence. Despite this, when tasked with several simple questions supported by a generic fact, LLMs often struggle to abstract and apply the generic fact to provide consistent and precise answers, revealing a deficiency in abstract reasoning abilities. This has sparked a vigorous debate about whether LLMs are genuinely reasoning or merely memorizing. In light of this, we design a preliminary study to quantify and delve into the abstract reasoning abilities of existing LLMs. Our findings reveal a substantial discrepancy between their general reasoning and abstract reasoning performances. To relieve this problem, we tailor an abstract reasoning dataset (AbsR) together with a meaningful learning paradigm to teach LLMs how to leverage generic facts for reasoning purposes. The results show that our approach not only boosts the general reasoning performance of LLMs but also makes considerable strides towards their capacity for abstract reasoning, moving beyond simple memorization or imitation to a more nuanced understanding and application of generic facts.

Poster,Measuring Dejavu Memorization Efficiently,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93225,"Narine Kokhlikyan, Bargav Jayaraman, Florian Bordes, Chuan Guo, Kamalika Chaudhuri","Recent research has shown that representation learning models may accidentally memorize their training data. For example, the déjà vu method shows that for certain representation learning models and training images, it is sometimes possible to correctly predict the foreground label given only the representation of he background – better than through dataset-level correlations. However, their measurement method requires training two models – one to estimate dataset-level correlations and the other to estimate memorization. This multiple model setup becomes infeasible for large open-source models. In this work, we propose alter native simple methods to estimate dataset-level correlations, and show that these can be used to approximate an off-the-shelf model’s memorization ability without any retraining. This enables, for the first time, the measurement of memorization in pre-trained open-source image representation and vision-language models. Our results show that different ways of measuring memorization yield very similar aggregate results. We also find that open-source models typically have lower aggregate memorization than similar models trained on a subset of the data. The code is available both for vision (https://github.com/facebookresearch/DejaVuOSS) and vision language (https://github.com/facebookresearch/VLMDejaVu) models."
Poster,Measuring Goal-Directedness,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93645,"Matt MacDermott, James Fox, Francesco Belardinelli, Tom Everitt","We define maximum entropy goal-directedness (MEG), a formal measure of goal-directedness in causal models and Markov decision processes, and give algorithmsfor computing it. Measuring goal-directedness is important, as it is a criticalelement of many concerns about harm from AI. It is also of philosophical interest,as goal-directedness is a key aspect of agency. MEG is based on an adaptation ofthe maximum causal entropy framework used in inverse reinforcement learning. Itcan measure goal-directedness with respect to a known utility function, a hypothesisclass of utility functions, or a set of random variables. We prove that MEG satisfiesseveral desiderata and demonstrate our algorithms with small-scale experiments."
Poster,Measuring Multimodal Mathematical Reasoning with MATH-Vision Dataset,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97697,"Ke Wang, Junting Pan, Weikang Shi, Zimu Lu, Houxing Ren, Aojun Zhou, Mingjie Zhan, Hongsheng Li","Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promising results in mathematical reasoning within visual contexts, with models exceeding human-level performance on existing benchmarks such as MathVista. However, we observe significant limitations in the diversity of questions and breadth of subjects covered by these benchmarks. To address this issue, we present the MATH-Vision (MATH-V) dataset, a meticulously curated collection of 3,040 high-quality mathematical problems with visual contexts sourced from real math competitions. Spanning 16 distinct mathematical disciplines and graded across 5 levels of difficulty, our dataset provides a comprehensive and diverse set of challenges for evaluating the mathematical reasoning abilities of LMMs. Through extensive experimentation, we unveil a notable performance gap between current LMMs and human performance on \datasetname, underscoring the imperative for further advancements in LMMs. Moreover, our detailed categorization allows for a thorough error analysis of LMMs, offering valuable insights to guide future research and development.

Poster,Measuring Mutual Policy Divergence for Multi-Agent Sequential Exploration,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93051,"Haowen Dou, Lujuan Dang, Zhirong Luan, Badong Chen","Despite the success of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms in cooperative tasks, previous works, unfortunately, face challenges in heterogeneous scenarios since they simply disable parameter sharing for agent specialization. Sequential updating scheme was thus proposed, naturally diversifying agents by encouraging agents to learn from preceding ones. However, the exploration strategy in sequential scheme has not been investigated. Benefiting from updating one-by-one, agents have the access to the information from preceding agents. Thus, in this work, we propose to exploit the preceding information to enhance exploration and heterogeneity sequentially. We present Multi-Agent Divergence Policy Optimization (MADPO), equipped with mutual policy divergence maximization framework. We quantify the policy discrepancies between episodes to enhance exploration and between agents to heterogenize agents, termed intra-agent and inter-agent policy divergence. To address the issue that traditional divergence measurements lack stability and directionality, we propose to employ the conditional Cauchy-Schwarz divergence to provide entropy-guided exploration incentives. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art sequential updating approaches in two challenging multi-agent tasks with various heterogeneous scenarios.
