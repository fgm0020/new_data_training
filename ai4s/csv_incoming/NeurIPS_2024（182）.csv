Poster,HAWK: Learning to Understand Open-World Video Anomalies,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93219,"Jiaqi Tang, Hao LU, RUIZHENG WU, Xiaogang Xu, Ke Ma, Cheng Fang, Bin Guo, Jiangbo Lu, Qifeng Chen, Yingcong Chen","Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) systems can autonomously monitor and identify disturbances, reducing the need for manual labor and associated costs. However, current VAD systems are often limited by their superficial semantic understanding of scenes and minimal user interaction. Additionally, the prevalent data scarcity in existing datasets restricts their applicability in open-world scenarios.In this paper, we introduce HAWK, a novel framework that leverages interactive large Visual Language Models (VLM) to interpret video anomalies precisely. Recognizing the difference in motion information between abnormal and normal videos, HAWK explicitly integrates motion modality to enhance anomaly identification. To reinforce motion attention, we construct an auxiliary consistency loss within the motion and video space, guiding the video branch to focus on the motion modality. Moreover, to improve the interpretation of motion-to-language, we establish a clear supervisory relationship between motion and its linguistic representation. Furthermore, we have annotated over 8,000 anomaly videos with language descriptions, enabling effective training across diverse open-world scenarios, and also created 8,000 question-answering pairs for users' open-world questions. The final results demonstrate that HAWK achieves SOTA performance, surpassing existing baselines in both video description generation and question-answering. Our codes/dataset/demo will be released at https://github.com/jqtangust/hawk."
Poster,HC-GAE: The Hierarchical Cluster-based Graph Auto-Encoder for Graph Representation Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94176,"Lu Bai, Zhuo Xu, Lixin Cui, Ming Li, Yue Wang, Edwin Hancock","Graph Auto-Encoders (GAEs) are powerful tools for graph representation learning. In this paper, we develop a novel Hierarchical Cluster-based GAE (HC-GAE), that can learn effective structural characteristics for graph data analysis. To this end, during the encoding process, we commence by utilizing the hard node assignment to decompose a sample graph into a family of separated subgraphs. We compress each subgraph into a coarsened node, transforming the original graph into a coarsened graph. On the other hand, during the decoding process, we adopt the soft node assignment to reconstruct the original graph structure by expanding the coarsened nodes. By hierarchically performing the above compressing procedure during the decoding process as well as the expanding procedure during the decoding process, the proposed HC-GAE can effectively extract bidirectionally hierarchical structural features of the original sample graph. Furthermore, we re-design the loss function that can integrate the information from either the encoder or the decoder. Since the associated graph convolution operation of the proposed HC-GAE is restricted in each individual separated subgraph and cannot propagate the node information between different subgraphs, the proposed HC-GAE can significantly reduce the over-smoothing problem arising in the classical convolution-based GAEs. The proposed HC-GAE can generate effective representations for either node classification or graph classification, and the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness on real-world datasets."
Poster,HDR-GS: Efficient High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis at 1000x Speed via Gaussian Splatting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95805,"Yuanhao Cai, Zihao Xiao, Yixun Liang, Minghan Qin, Yulun Zhang, Xiaokang Yang, Yaoyao Liu, Alan Yuille","High dynamic range (HDR) novel view synthesis (NVS) aims to create photorealistic images from novel viewpoints using HDR imaging techniques. The rendered HDR images capture a wider range of brightness levels containing more details of the scene than normal low dynamic range (LDR) images. Existing HDR NVS methods are mainly based on NeRF. They suffer from long training time and slow inference speed. In this paper, we propose a new framework, High Dynamic Range Gaussian Splatting (HDR-GS), which can efficiently render novel HDR views and reconstruct LDR images with a user input exposure time. Specifically, we design a Dual Dynamic Range (DDR) Gaussian point cloud model that uses spherical harmonics to fit HDR color and employs an MLP-based tone-mapper to render LDR color. The HDR and LDR colors are then fed into two Parallel Differentiable Rasterization (PDR) processes to reconstruct HDR and LDR views. To establish the data foundation for the research of 3D Gaussian splatting-based methods in HDR NVS, we recalibrate the camera parameters and compute the initial positions for Gaussian point clouds. Comprehensive experiments show that HDR-GS surpasses the state-of-the-art NeRF-based method by 3.84 and 1.91 dB on LDR and HDR NVS while enjoying 1000$\times$ inference speed and only costing 6.3\% training time.

Poster,HEALNet: Multimodal Fusion for Heterogeneous Biomedical Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95829,"Konstantin Hemker, Nikola Simidjievski, Mateja Jamnik","Technological advances in medical data collection, such as high-throughput genomic sequencing and digital high-resolution histopathology, have contributed to the rising requirement for multimodal biomedical modelling, specifically for image, tabular and graph data. Most multimodal deep learning approaches use modality-specific architectures that are often trained separately and cannot capture the crucial cross-modal information that motivates the integration of different data sources. This paper presents the **H**ybrid **E**arly-fusion **A**ttention **L**earning **Net**work (HEALNet) – a flexible multimodal fusion architecture, which: a) preserves modality-specific structural information, b) captures the cross-modal interactions and structural information in a shared latent space, c) can effectively handle missing modalities during training and inference, and d) enables intuitive model inspection by learning on the raw data input instead of opaque embeddings. We conduct multimodal survival analysis on Whole Slide Images and Multi-omic data on four cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). HEALNet achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other end-to-end trained fusion models, substantially improving over unimodal and multimodal baselines whilst being robust in scenarios with missing modalities. The code is available at https://github.com/konst-int-i/healnet."
Poster,Heavy-Tailed Class Imbalance and Why Adam Outperforms Gradient Descent on Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95059,"Frederik Kunstner, Alan Milligan, Robin Yadav, Mark Schmidt, Alberto Bietti","Adam has been shown to outperform gradient descent on large language models by a larger margin than on other tasks, but it is unclear why. We show that a key factor in this performance gap is the heavy-tailed class imbalance found in language tasks. When trained with gradient descent, the loss of infrequent words decreases more slowly than the loss of frequent ones. This leads to a slow decrease on the average loss as most samples come from infrequent words. On the other hand, Adam and sign-based methods are less sensitive to this problem. To establish that this behavior is caused by class imbalance, we show empirically that it can be reproduced across architectures and data types, on language transformers, vision CNNs, and linear models. On a linear model with cross-entropy loss, we show that class imbalance leads to imbalanced, correlated gradients and Hessians that have been hypothesized to benefit Adam. We also prove that, in continuous time, gradient descent converges slowly on low-frequency classes while sign descent does not."
Poster,HelpSteer 2: Open-source dataset for training top-performing reward models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97706,"Zhilin Wang, Yi Dong, Olivier Delalleau, Jiaqi Zeng, Gerald Shen, Daniel Egert, Jimmy Zhang, Makesh Narsimhan Sreedhar, Oleksii Kuchaiev","High-quality preference datasets are essential for training reward models that can effectively guide large language models (LLMs) in generating high-quality responses aligned with human preferences.As LLMs become stronger and better aligned, permissively licensed preference datasets, such as Open Assistant, HH-RLHF, and HelpSteer need to be updated to remain effective for reward modeling.Methods that distil preference data from proprietary LLMs such as GPT-4 have restrictions on commercial usage imposed by model providers.To improve upon both generated responses and attribute labeling quality, we release HelpSteer2, a permissively licensed preference dataset (CC-BY-4.0).  Using a powerful Nemotron-4-340B base model trained on HelpSteer2, we are able to achieve the SOTA score (92.0%) on Reward-Bench's primary dataset, outperforming currently listed open and proprietary models, as of June 12th, 2024.Notably, HelpSteer2 consists of only ten thousand response pairs, an order of magnitude fewer than existing preference datasets (e.g., HH-RLHF), which makes it highly efficient for training reward models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that reward models trained with HelpSteer2 are effective in aligning LLMs. Additionally, we propose SteerLM 2.0, a model alignment approach that can effectively make use of the rich multi-attribute score predicted by our reward models. HelpSteer2 is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer2 and code is available at https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Aligner"
Poster,HEMM: Holistic Evaluation of Multimodal Foundation Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97825,"Paul Pu Liang, Akshay Goindani, Talha Chafekar, Leena Mathur, Haofei Yu, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Louis-Philippe Morency","Multimodal foundation models that can holistically process text alongside images, video, audio, and other sensory modalities are increasingly used in a variety of real-world applications. However, it is challenging to characterize and study progress in multimodal foundation models, given the range of possible modeling decisions, tasks, and domains. In this paper, we introduce Holistic Evaluation of Multimodal Models (HEMM) to systematically evaluate the capabilities of multimodal foundation models across a set of 3 dimensions: basic skills, information flow, and real-world use cases. Basic multimodal skills are internal abilities required to solve problems, such as learning interactions across modalities, fine-grained alignment, multi-step reasoning, and the ability to handle external knowledge. Information flow studies how multimodal content changes during a task through querying, translation, editing, and fusion. Use cases span domain-specific challenges introduced in real-world multimedia, affective computing, natural sciences, healthcare, and human-computer interaction applications. Through comprehensive experiments across the 30 tasks in HEMM, we (1) identify key dataset dimensions (e.g., basic skills, information flows, and use cases) that pose challenges to today’s models, and (2) distill performance trends regarding how different modeling dimensions (e.g., scale, pre-training data, multimodal alignment, pre-training, and instruction tuning objectives) influence performance. Our conclusions regarding challenging multimodal interactions, use cases, and tasks requiring reasoning and external knowledge, the benefits of data and model scale, and the impacts of instruction-tuning yield actionable insights for future work in multimodal foundation models."
Poster,HENASY: Learning to Assemble Scene-Entities for Interpretable Egocentric Video-Language Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96412,"Khoa Vo, Thinh Phan, Kashu Yamazaki, Minh Tran, Ngan Le","Current video-language models (VLMs) rely extensively on instance-level alignment between video and language modalities, which presents two major limitations: (1) visual reasoning disobeys the natural perception that humans do in first-person perspective, leading to a lack of reasoning interpretation; and (2) learning is limited in capturing inherent fine-grained relationships between two modalities.In this paper, we take an inspiration from human perception and explore a compositional approach for egocentric video representation. We introduce HENASY (Hierarchical ENtities ASsemblY), which includes a spatiotemporal token grouping mechanism to explicitly assemble dynamically evolving scene entities through time and model their relationship for video representation. By leveraging compositional structure understanding, HENASY possesses strong interpretability via visual grounding with free-form text queries. We further explore a suite of multi-grained contrastive losses to facilitate entity-centric understandings. This comprises three alignment types: video-narration, noun-entity, verb-entities alignments.Our method demonstrates strong interpretability in both quantitative and qualitative experiments; while maintaining competitive performances on five downstream tasks via zero-shot transfer or as video/text representation, including video/text retrieval, action recognition, multi-choice query, natural language query, and moments query.Project page: https://uark-aicv.github.io/HENASY"
Poster,HEPrune: Fast Private Training of Deep Neural Networks With Encrypted Data Pruning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93046,"Yancheng Zhang, Mengxin Zheng, Yuzhang Shang, Xun Chen, Qian Lou","Non-interactive cryptographic computing, Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), provides a promising solution for private neural network training on encrypted data. One challenge of FHE-based private training is its large computational overhead, especially the multiple rounds of forward and backward execution on each encrypted data sample. Considering the existence of largely redundant data samples, pruning them will significantly speed up the training, as proven in plain non-FHE training. Executing the data pruning of encrypted data on the server side is not trivial since the knowledge calculation of data pruning needs complex and expensive executions on encrypted data. There is a lack of FHE-based data pruning protocol for efficient, private training. In this paper, we propose, \textit{HEPrune}, to construct a FHE data-pruning protocol and then design an FHE-friendly data-pruning algorithm under client-aided or non-client-aided settings, respectively. We also observed that data sample pruning may not always remove ciphertexts, leaving large empty slots and limiting the effects of data pruning. Thus, in HEPrune, we further propose ciphertext-wise pruning to reduce ciphertext computation numbers without hurting accuracy. Experimental results show that our work can achieve a $16\times$ speedup with only a $0.6\%$ accuracy drop over prior work.

Poster,HEST-1k: A Dataset For Spatial Transcriptomics and Histology Image Analysis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97514,"Guillaume Jaume, Paul Doucet, Andrew Song, Ming Yang Lu, Cristina Almagro Pérez, Sophia Wagner, Anurag Vaidya, Richard Chen, Drew Williamson, Ahrong Kim, Faisal Mahmood","Spatial transcriptomics enables interrogating the molecular composition of tissue with ever-increasing resolution and sensitivity. However, costs, rapidly evolving technology, and lack of standards have constrained computational methods in ST to narrow tasks and small cohorts. In addition, the underlying tissue morphology, as reflected by H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs), encodes rich information often overlooked in ST studies. Here, we introduce HEST-1k, a collection of 1,229 spatial transcriptomic profiles, each linked to a WSI and extensive metadata. HEST-1k was assembled from 153 public and internal cohorts encompassing 26 organs, two species (Homo Sapiens and Mus Musculus), and 367 cancer samples from 25 cancer types. HEST-1k processing enabled the identification of 2.1 million expression-morphology pairs and over 76 million nuclei. To support its development, we additionally introduce the HEST-Library, a Python package designed to perform a range of actions with HEST samples. We test HEST-1k and Library on three use cases: (1) benchmarking foundation models for pathology (HEST-Benchmark), (2) biomarker exploration, and (3) multimodal representation learning. HEST-1k, HEST-Library, and HEST-Benchmark can be freely accessed at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/hest."
