Poster,Deep Learning in Medical Image Registration: Magic or Mirage?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93821,"Rohit Jena, Deeksha Sethi, Pratik Chaudhari, James Gee","Classical optimization and learning-based methods are the two reigning paradigms in deformable image registration. While optimization-based methods boast generalizability across modalities and robust performance, learning-based methods promise peak performance, incorporating weak supervision and amortized optimization. However, the exact conditions for either paradigm to perform well over the other are shrouded and not explicitly outlined in the existing literature. In this paper, we make an explicit correspondence between the mutual information of the distribution of per-pixel intensity and labels, and the performance of classical registration methods. This strong correlation hints to the fact that architectural designs in learning-based methods is unlikely to affect this correlation, and therefore, the performance of learning-based methods. This hypothesis is thoroughly validated with state-of-the-art classical and learning-based methods. However, learning-based methods with weak supervision can perform high-fidelity intensity and label registration, which is not possible with classical methods. Next, we show that this high-fidelity feature learning does not translate to invariance to domain shift, and learning-based methods are sensitive to such changes in the data distribution. We reassess and recalibrate performance expectations from classical and DLIR methods under access to label supervision, training time, and its generalization capabilities under minor domain shifts."
Poster,"Deep Learning Through A Telescoping Lens: A Simple Model Provides Empirical Insights On Grokking, Gradient Boosting & Beyond",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95420,"Alan Jeffares, Alicia Curth, Mihaela van der Schaar","Deep learning sometimes appears to work in unexpected ways. In pursuit of a deeper understanding of its surprising behaviors, we investigate the utility of a simple yet accurate model of a trained neural network consisting of a sequence of first-order approximations telescoping out into a single empirically operational tool for practical analysis. Across three case studies, we illustrate how it can be applied to derive new empirical insights on a diverse range of prominent phenomena in the literature -- including double descent, grokking, linear mode connectivity, and the challenges of applying deep learning on tabular data -- highlighting that this model allows us to construct and extract metrics that help predict and understand the a priori unexpected performance of neural networks. We also demonstrate that this model presents a pedagogical formalism allowing us to isolate components of the training process even in complex contemporary settings, providing a lens to reason about the effects of design choices such as architecture & optimization strategy, and reveals surprising parallels between neural network learning and gradient boosting."
Poster,Deep linear networks for regression are implicitly regularized towards flat minima,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96004,"Pierre Marion, Lénaïc Chizat","The largest eigenvalue of the Hessian, or sharpness, of neural networks is a key quantity to understand their optimization dynamics. In this paper, we study the sharpness of deep linear networks for univariate regression. Minimizers can have arbitrarily large sharpness, but not an arbitrarily small one. Indeed, we show a lower bound on the sharpness of minimizers, which grows linearly with depth. We then study the properties of the minimizer found by gradient flow, which is the limit of gradient descent with vanishing learning rate. We show an implicit regularization towards flat minima: the sharpness of the minimizer is no more than a constant times the lower bound. The constant depends on the condition number of the data covariance matrix, but not on width or depth. This result is proven both for a small-scale initialization and a residual initialization. Results of independent interest are shown in both cases. For small-scale initialization, we show that the learned weight matrices are approximately rank-one and that their singular vectors align. For residual initialization, convergence of the gradient flow for a Gaussian initialization of the residual network is proven. Numerical experiments illustrate our results and connect them to gradient descent with non-vanishing learning rate."
Poster,"Deep Policy Gradient Methods Without Batch Updates, Target Networks, or Replay Buffers",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96084,"Gautham Vasan, Mohamed Elsayed, Seyed Alireza Azimi, Jiamin He, Fahim Shahriar, Colin Bellinger, Martha White, Rupam Mahmood","Modern deep policy gradient methods achieve effective performance on simulated robotic tasks, but they all require large replay buffers or expensive batch updates, or both, making them incompatible for real systems with resource-limited computers. We show that these methods fail catastrophically when limited to small replay buffers or during *incremental learning*, where updates only use the most recent sample without batch updates or a replay buffer. We propose a novel incremental deep policy gradient method --- *Action Value Gradient (AVG)* and a set of normalization and scaling techniques to address the challenges of instability in incremental learning. On robotic simulation benchmarks, we show that AVG is the only incremental method that learns effectively, often achieving final performance comparable to batch policy gradient methods. This advancement enabled us to show for the first time effective deep reinforcement learning with real robots using only incremental updates, employing a robotic manipulator and a mobile robot."
Poster,DeepStack: Deeply Stacking Visual Tokens is Surprisingly Simple and Effective for LMMs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94201,"Lingchen Meng, Jianwei Yang, Rui Tian, Xiyang Dai, Zuxuan Wu, Jianfeng Gao, Yu-Gang Jiang","Most large multimodal models (LMMs) are implemented by feeding visual tokens as a sequence into the first layer of a large language model (LLM). The resulting architecture is simple but significantly increases computation and memory costs, as it has to handle a large number of additional tokens in its input layer. This paper presents a new architecture *DeepStack* for LMMs. Considering $N$ layers in the language and vision transformer of LMMs, we stack the visual tokens into $N$ groups and feed each group to its aligned transformer layer from bottom to top. Surprisingly, this simple method greatly enhances the power of LMMs to model interactions among visual tokens across layers but with minimal additional cost. We apply *DeepStack* to both language and vision transformer in LMMs, and validate the effectiveness of *DeepStack* LMMs with extensive empirical results. Using the same context length, our DeepStack 7B and 13B parameters surpass their counterparts by 2.7 and 2.9 on average across 9 benchmarks, respectively. Using only one-fifth of the context length, DeepStack rivals closely to the counterparts that use the full context length. These gains are particularly pronounced on high-resolution tasks, *e.g.*, 4.2, 11.0, and 4.0 improvements on TextVQA, DocVQA, and InfoVQA compared to LLaVA-1.5-7B, respectively. We further apply *DeepStack* to vision transformer layers, which brings us a similar amount of improvements, 3.8 on average compared with LLaVA-1.5-7B."
Poster,Deep Submodular Peripteral Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93329,"Gantavya Bhatt, Arnav Das, Jeff A Bilmes","Submodular functions, crucial for various applications, often lack practical learning methods for their acquisition.  Seemingly unrelated, learning a scaling from oracles offering graded pairwise preferences (GPC) is underexplored, despite a rich history in psychometrics. In this paper, we introduce deep submodular peripteral networks (DSPNs), a novel parametric family of submodular functions, and methods for their training using a GPC-based strategy to connect and then tackle both of the above challenges.  We introduce newly devised GPC-style ``peripteral'' loss which leverages numerically graded relationships between pairs of objects (sets in our case). Unlike traditional contrastive learning, or RHLF preference ranking, our method utilizes graded comparisons, extracting more nuanced information than just binary-outcome comparisons, and contrasts sets of any size (not just two). We also define a novel suite of automatic sampling strategies for training, including active-learning inspired submodular feedback.  We demonstrate DSPNs' efficacy in learning submodularity from a costly target submodular function and demonstrate its superiority both for experimental design and online streaming applications."
Poster,Deep Support Vectors,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96584,"JunHoo Lee, Hyunho Lee, Kyomin Hwang, Nojun Kwak","Deep learning has achieved tremendous success. However, unlike SVMs, which provide direct decision criteria and can be trained with a small dataset, it still has significant weaknesses due to its requirement for massive datasets during training and the black-box characteristics on decision criteria. This paper addresses these issues by identifying support vectors in deep learning models. To this end, we propose the DeepKKT condition, an adaptation of the traditional Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition for deep learning models, and confirm that generated Deep Support Vectors (DSVs) using this condition exhibit properties similar to traditional support vectors. This allows us to apply our method to few-shot dataset distillation problems and alleviate the black-box characteristics of deep learning models. Additionally, we demonstrate that the DeepKKT condition can transform conventional classification models into generative models with high fidelity, particularly as latent generation models using class labels as latent variables. We validate the effectiveness of DSVs using common datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100) on the general architectures (ResNet and ConvNet), proving their practical applicability."
Poster,DeeR-VLA: Dynamic Inference of Multimodal Large Language Models for Efficient Robot Execution,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95242,"Yang Yue, Yulin Wang, Bingyi Kang, Yizeng Han, Shenzhi Wang, Shiji Song, Jiashi Feng, Gao Huang","Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable comprehension and reasoning capabilities with complex language and visual data.These advances have spurred the vision of establishing a generalist robotic MLLM proficient in understanding complex human instructions and accomplishing various embodied tasks, whose feasibility has been recently verified~\cite{rt-2,rt-x}.However, developing MLLMs for real-world robots is challenging due to the typically limited computation and memory capacities available on robotic platforms. In contrast, the inference of MLLMs usually incorporates storing billions of parameters and performing tremendous computation, imposing significant hardware demands.In our paper, we seek to address this challenge by leveraging an intriguing observation: relatively easier situations make up the bulk of the procedure of controlling robots to fulfill diverse tasks, and they generally require far smaller models to obtain the correct robotic actions.Motivated by this observation, we propose a \emph{DynamicEarly-Exit for Robotic MLLM} (DeeR) framework that automatically adjusts the size of the activated MLLM based on each situation at hand. The approach leverages a multi-exit architecture in MLLMs, which allows the model to cease processing once a proper size of the model has been activated for a specific situation, thus avoiding further redundant computation. Additionally, we develop novel algorithms that establish early-termination criteria for DeeR, conditioned on predefined demands such as average computational cost (\emph{i.e.}, power consumption), as well as peak computational consumption (\emph{i.e.}, latency) and GPU memory usage. These enhancements ensure that DeeR operates efficiently under varying resource constraints while maintaining competitive performance.Moreover, we design a tailored training method for integrating temporal information on top of such multi-exit architectures to predict actions reasonably. On the CALVIN robot manipulation benchmark, DeeR demonstrates significant reductions in computational costs by 5.2-6.5x and GPU memory by 2x without compromising performance.Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/yueyang130/DeeR-VLA."
Poster,Defensive Unlearning with Adversarial Training for Robust Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94320,"Yimeng Zhang, Xin Chen, Jinghan Jia, Yihua Zhang, Chongyu Fan, Jiancheng Liu, Mingyi Hong, Ke Ding, Sijia Liu","Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation, but they also pose safety risks, such as the potential generation of harmful content and copyright violations. The techniques of machine unlearning, also known as concept erasing, have been developed to address these risks. However, these techniques remain vulnerable to adversarial prompt attacks, which can prompt DMs post-unlearning to regenerate undesired images containing concepts (such as nudity) meant to be erased. This work aims to enhance the robustness of concept erasing by integrating the principle of adversarial training (AT) into machine unlearning, resulting in the robust unlearning framework referred to as AdvUnlearn. However, achieving this effectively and efficiently is highly nontrivial. First, we find that a straightforward implementation of AT compromises DMs’ image generation quality post-unlearning. To address this, we develop a utility-retaining regularization on an additional retain set, optimizing the trade-off between concept erasure robustness and model utility in AdvUnlearn. Moreover, we identify the text encoder as a more suitable module for robustification compared to UNet, ensuring unlearning effectiveness. And the acquired text encoder can serve as a plug-and-play robust unlearner for various DM types. Empirically, we perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the robustness advantage of AdvUnlearn across various DM unlearning scenarios, including the erasure of nudity, objects, and style concepts. In addition to robustness, AdvUnlearn also achieves a balanced tradeoff with model utility. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically explore robust DM unlearning through AT, setting it apart from existing methods that overlook robustness in concept erasing.

Poster,DeformableTST: Transformer for Time Series Forecasting without Over-reliance on Patching,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96221,"Donghao Luo, Xue Wang","With the proposal of patching technique in time series forecasting, Transformerbased models have achieved compelling performance and gained great interest fromthe time series community. But at the same time, we observe a new problem thatthe recent Transformer-based models are overly reliant on patching to achieve idealperformance, which limits their applicability to some forecasting tasks unsuitablefor patching. In this paper, we intent to handle this emerging issue. Through divinginto the relationship between patching and full attention (the core mechanismin Transformer-based models), we further find out the reason behind this issueis that full attention relies overly on the guidance of patching to focus on theimportant time points and learn non-trivial temporal representation. Based on thisfinding, we propose DeformableTST as an effective solution to this emergingissue. Specifically, we propose deformable attention, a sparse attention mechanismthat can better focus on the important time points by itself, to get rid of the need ofpatching. And we also adopt a hierarchical structure to alleviate the efficiency issuecaused by the removal of patching. Experimentally, our DeformableTST achievesthe consistent state-of-the-art performance in a broader range of time series tasks,especially achieving promising performance in forecasting tasks unsuitable forpatching, therefore successfully reducing the reliance on patching and broadeningthe applicability of Transformer-based models.
