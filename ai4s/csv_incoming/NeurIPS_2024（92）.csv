Poster,Data Attribution for Text-to-Image Models by Unlearning Synthesized Images,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93886,"Sheng-Yu Wang, Aaron Hertzmann, Alexei Efros, Jun-Yan Zhu, Richard Zhang","The goal of data attribution for text-to-image models is to identify the training images that most influence the generation of a new image. Influence is defined such that, for a given output, if a model is retrained from scratch without the most influential images, the model would fail to reproduce the same output. Unfortunately, directly searching for these influential images is computationally infeasible, since it would require repeatedly retraining models from scratch. In our work, we propose an efficient data attribution method by simulating unlearning the synthesized image. We achieve this by increasing the training loss on the output image, without catastrophic forgetting of other, unrelated concepts. We then identify training images with significant loss deviations after the unlearning process and label these as influential. We evaluate our method with a computationally intensive but ""gold-standard"" retraining from scratch and demonstrate our method's advantages over previous methods."
Poster,Data Augmentation with Diffusion for Open-Set Semi-Supervised Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95374,"Seonghyun Ban, Heesan Kong, Kee-Eung Kim","Semi-supervised learning (SSL) seeks to utilize unlabeled data to overcome the limited amount of labeled data and improve model performance. However, many SSL methods typically struggle in real-world scenarios, particularly when there is a large number of irrelevant instances in the unlabeled data that do not belong to any class in the labeled data. Previous approaches often downweight instances from irrelevant classes to mitigate the negative impact of class distribution mismatch on model training. However, by discarding irrelevant instances, they may result in the loss of valuable information such as invariance, regularity, and diversity within the data. In this paper, we propose a data-centric generative augmentation approach that leverages a diffusion model to enrich labeled data using both labeled and unlabeled samples. A key challenge is extracting the diversity inherent in the unlabeled data while mitigating the generation of samples irrelevant to the labeled data. To tackle this issue, we combine diffusion model training with a discriminator that identifies and reduces the impact of irrelevant instances. We also demonstrate that such a trained diffusion model can even convert an irrelevant instance into a relevant one, yielding highly effective synthetic data for training. Through a comprehensive suite of experiments, we show that our data augmentation approach significantly enhances the performance of SSL methods, especially in the presence of class distribution mismatch."
Poster,DataComp-LM: In search of the next generation of training sets for language models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97814,"Jeffrey Li, Alex Fang, Georgios Smyrnis, Maor Ivgi, Matt Jordan, Samir Yitzhak Gadre, Hritik Bansal, Etash Guha, Sedrick Scott Keh, Kushal Arora, Saurabh Garg, Rui Xin, Niklas Muennighoff, Reinhard Heckel, Jean Mercat, Mayee Chen, Suchin Gururangan, Mitchell Wortsman, Alon Albalak, Yonatan Bitton, Marianna Nezhurina, Amro Abbas, Cheng-Yu Hsieh, Dhruba Ghosh, Josh Gardner, Maciej Kilian, Hanlin Zhang, Rulin Shao, Sarah Pratt, Sunny Sanyal, Gabriel Ilharco, Giannis Daras, Kalyani Marathe, Aaron Gokaslan, Jieyu Zhang, Khyathi Chandu, Thao Nguyen, Igor Vasiljevic, Sham Kakade, Shuran Song, Sujay Sanghavi, Fartash Faghri, Sewoong Oh, Luke Zettlemoyer, Kyle Lo, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Hadi Pouransari, Alexander Toshev, Stephanie Wang, Dirk Groeneveld, Luca Soldaini, Pang Wei Koh, Jenia Jitsev, Thomas Kollar, Alex Dimakis, Yair Carmon, Achal Dave, Ludwig Schmidt, Vaishaal Shankar","We introduce DataComp for Language Models, a testbed for controlled dataset experiments with the goal of improving language models.As part of DCLM, we provide a standardized corpus of 240T tokens extracted from Common Crawl, effective pretraining recipes based on the OpenLM framework, and a broad suite of 53 downstream evaluations.Participants in the DCLM benchmark can experiment with data curation strategies such as deduplication, filtering, and data mixing atmodel scales ranging from 412M to 7B parameters.As a baseline for DCLM, we conduct extensive experiments and find that model-based filtering is key to assembling a high-quality training set.The resulting dataset, DCLM-Baseline, enables training a 7B parameter language model from scratch to 63% 5-shot accuracy on MMLU with 2T training tokens.Compared to MAP-Neo, the previous state-of-the-art in open-data language models, DCLM-Baseline represents a 6 percentage point improvement on MMLU while being trained with half the compute.Our results highlight the importance of dataset design for training language models and offer a starting point for further research on data curation. We release the \dclm benchmark, framework, models, and datasets at https://www.datacomp.ai/dclm/"
Poster,Data curation via joint example selection further accelerates multimodal learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97437,"Talfan Evans, Nikhil Parthasarathy, Hamza Merzic, Olivier Henaff","Data curation is an essential component of large-scale pretraining. In this work, we demonstrate that jointly prioritizing batches of data is more effective for learning than selecting examples independently. Multimodal contrastive objectives expose the dependencies between data and thus naturally yield criteria for measuring the joint learnability of a batch. We derive a simple and tractable algorithm for selecting such batches, which significantly accelerate training beyond individually-prioritized data points. As performance improves by selecting from large super-batches, we  also leverage recent advances in model approximation to reduce the computational overhead of scoring. As a result, our approach—multimodal contrastive learning with joint example selection (JEST)—surpasses state-of-the-art pretraining methods with up to 13× fewer iterations and 10× less computation. Essential to the performance of JEST is the ability to steer the data selection process towards the distribution of smaller, well-curated datasets via pretrained reference models, exposing data curation as a new dimension for neural scaling laws."
Poster,Data Distribution Valuation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96892,"Xinyi Xu, Shuaiqi Wang, Chuan Sheng Foo, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low, Giulia Fanti","Data valuation is a class of techniques for quantitatively assessing the value of data for applications like pricing in data marketplaces. Existing data valuation methods define a value for a discrete dataset. However, in many use cases, users are interested in not only the value of the dataset, but that of the distribution from which the dataset was sampled. For example, consider a buyer trying to evaluate whether to purchase data from different vendors. The buyer may observe (and compare) only a small preview sample from each vendor, to decide which vendor's data distribution is most useful to the buyer and purchase. The core question is how should we compare the values of data distributions from their samples? Under a Huber characterization of the data heterogeneity across vendors, we propose a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD)-based valuation method which enables theoretically principled and actionable policies for comparing data distributions from samples. We empirically demonstrate that our method is sample-efficient and effective in identifying valuable data distributions against several existing baselines, on multiple real-world datasets (e.g., network intrusion detection, credit card fraud detection) and downstream applications (classification, regression)."
Poster,Data-Driven Discovery of Dynamical Systems in Pharmacology using Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95672,"Samuel Holt, Zhaozhi Qian, Tennison Liu, Jim Weatherall, Mihaela van der Schaar","The discovery of dynamical systems is crucial across a range of fields, including pharmacology, epidemiology, and physical sciences. *Accurate* and *interpretable* modeling of these systems is essential for understanding complex temporal processes, optimizing interventions, and minimizing adverse effects. In pharmacology, for example, precise modeling of drug dynamics is vital to maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing patient harm, as in chemotherapy. However, current models, often developed by human experts, are limited by high cost, lack of scalability, and restriction to existing human knowledge. In this paper, we present the **Data-Driven Discovery (D3)** framework, a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to iteratively discover and refine interpretable models of dynamical systems, demonstrated here with pharmacological applications. Unlike traditional methods, D3 enables the LLM to propose, acquire, and integrate new features, validate, and compare dynamical systems models, uncovering new insights into pharmacokinetics. Experiments on a pharmacokinetic Warfarin dataset reveal that D3 identifies a new plausible model that is well-fitting, highlighting its potential for precision dosing in clinical applications."
Poster,Data-Efficient Learning with Neural Programs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95230,"Alaia Solko-Breslin, Seewon Choi, Ziyang Li, Neelay Velingker, Rajeev Alur, Mayur Naik, Eric Wong","Many computational tasks can be naturally expressed as a composition of  a DNN followed by a program written in a traditional programming language or an API call to an LLM. We call such composites ""neural programs"" and focus on the problem of learning the DNN parameters when the training data consist of end-to-end input-output labels for the composite.  When the program is written in a differentiable logic programming language, techniques from neurosymbolic learning are applicable, but in general, the learning for neural programs requires estimating the gradients of black-box components. We present an algorithm for learning neural programs, called ISED, that only relies on input-output samples of black-box components. For evaluation, we introduce new benchmarks that involve calls to modern LLMs such as  GPT-4 and also consider benchmarks from the neurosymbolic learning literature. Our evaluation shows that for the latter benchmarks, ISED has comparable performance to state-of-the-art neurosymbolic frameworks. For the former, we use adaptations of prior work on gradient approximations of black-box components as a baseline, and show that ISED achieves comparable accuracy but in a more data- and sample-efficient manner."
Poster,Data-Efficient Operator Learning via Unsupervised Pretraining and In-Context Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95483,"Wuyang Chen, Jialin Song, Pu Ren, Shashank Subramanian, Dmitriy Morozov, Michael Mahoney","Recent years have witnessed the promise of coupling machine learning methods and physical domain-specific insights for solving scientific problems based on partial differential equations (PDEs).  However, being data-intensive, these methods still require a large amount of PDE data. This reintroduces the need for expensive numerical PDE solutions, partially undermining the original goal of avoiding these expensive simulations. In this work, seeking data efficiency, we design unsupervised pretraining for PDE operator learning. To reduce the need for training data with heavy simulation costs, we mine unlabeled PDE data without simulated solutions,and we pretrain neural operators with physics-inspired reconstruction-based proxy tasks. To improve out-of-distribution performance, we further assist neural operators in flexibly leveraging a similarity-based method that learns in-context examples, without incurring extra training costs or designs. Extensive empirical evaluations on a diverse set of PDEs demonstrate that our method is highly data-efficient, more generalizable, and even outperforms conventional vision-pretrained models.

Poster,Data-faithful Feature Attribution: Mitigating Unobservable Confounders via Instrumental Variables,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93948,"Qiheng Sun, Haocheng Xia, Jinfei Liu","The state-of-the-art feature attribution methods often neglect the influence of unobservable confounders, posing a risk of misinterpretation, especially when it is crucial for the interpretation to remain faithful to the data. To counteract this, we propose a new approach, data-faithful feature attribution, which trains a confounder-free model using instrumental variables. The cluttered effects of unobservable confounders in a model trained as such are decoupled from input features, thereby aligning the output of the model with the contribution of input features to the target feature in the data generation. Furthermore, feature attribution results produced by our method are more robust when focusing on attributions from the perspective of data generation. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches."
Poster,Data Free Backdoor Attacks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93546,"Bochuan Cao, Jinyuan Jia, Chuxuan Hu, Wenbo Guo, Zhen Xiang, Jinghui Chen, Bo Li, Dawn Song","Backdoor attacks aim to inject a backdoor into a classifier such that it predicts any input with an attacker-chosen backdoor trigger as an attacker-chosen target class. Existing backdoor attacks require either retraining the classifier with some clean data or modifying the model's architecture.As a result, they are 1) not applicable when clean data is unavailable, 2) less efficient when the model is large, and 3) less stealthy due to architecture changes. In this work, we propose DFBA, a novel retraining-free and data-free backdoor attack without changing the model architecture. Technically, our proposed method modifies a few parameters of a classifier to inject a backdoor. Through theoretical analysis, we verify that our injected backdoor is provably undetectable and unremovable by various state-of-the-art defenses under mild assumptions. Our evaluation on multiple datasets further demonstrates that our injected backdoor: 1) incurs negligible classification loss, 2) achieves 100\% attack success rates, and 3) bypasses six existing state-of-the-art defenses. Moreover, our comparison with a state-of-the-art non-data-free backdoor attack shows our attack is more stealthy and effective against various defenses while achieving less classification accuracy loss.We will release our code upon paper acceptance."
