Poster,Stable Minima Cannot Overfit in Univariate ReLU Networks: Generalization by Large Step Sizes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96450,"Dan Qiao, Kaiqi Zhang, Esha Singh, Daniel Soudry, Yu-Xiang Wang","We study the generalization of two-layer ReLU neural networks in a univariate nonparametric regression problem with noisy labels. This is a problem where kernels (\emph{e.g.} NTK) are provably sub-optimal and benign overfitting does not happen, thus disqualifying existing theory for interpolating (0-loss, global optimal) solutions. We present a new theory of generalization for local minima that gradient descent with a constant learning rate can \emph{stably} converge to.  We show that gradient descent with a fixed learning rate $\eta$ can only find local minima that represent smooth functions with a certain weighted \emph{first order total variation} bounded by $1/\eta - 1/2 + \widetilde{O}(\sigma + \sqrt{\mathrm{MSE}})$ where $\sigma$ is the label noise level, $\mathrm{MSE}$ is short for mean squared error against the ground truth, and $\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides a logarithmic factor. Under mild assumptions, we also prove a nearly-optimal MSE bound of $\widetilde{O}(n^{-4/5})$  within the strict interior of the support of the $n$ data points. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive simulation that demonstrates large learning rate training induces sparse linear spline fits. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to obtain generalization bound via minima stability in the non-interpolation case and the first to show ReLU NNs without regularization can achieve near-optimal rates in nonparametric regression."
Poster,Stable-Pose: Leveraging Transformers for Pose-Guided Text-to-Image Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95747,"Jiajun Wang, Morteza Ghahremani Boozandani, Yitong Li, Björn Ommer, Christian Wachinger","Controllable text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown impressive performance in generating high-quality visual content through the incorporation of various conditions. Current methods, however, exhibit limited performance when guided by skeleton human poses, especially in complex pose conditions such as side or rear perspectives of human figures. To address this issue, we present Stable-Pose, a novel adapter model that introduces a coarse-to-fine attention masking strategy into a vision Transformer (ViT) to gain accurate pose guidance for T2I models. Stable-Pose is designed to adeptly handle pose conditions within pre-trained Stable Diffusion, providing a refined and efficient way of aligning pose representation during image synthesis. We leverage the query-key self-attention mechanism of ViTs to explore the interconnections among different anatomical parts in human pose skeletons. Masked pose images are used to smoothly refine the attention maps based on target pose-related features in a hierarchical manner, transitioning from coarse to fine levels. Additionally, our loss function is formulated to allocate increased emphasis to the pose region, thereby augmenting the model's precision in capturing intricate pose details.    We assessed the performance of Stable-Pose across five public datasets under a wide range of indoor and outdoor human pose scenarios. Stable-Pose achieved an AP score of 57.1 in the LAION-Human dataset, marking around 13\% improvement over the established technique ControlNet.

Poster,StackEval: Benchmarking LLMs in Coding Assistance,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97856,"Nidhish Shah, Zulkuf Genc, Dogu Araci","We present two comprehensive benchmarks to evaluate the performance of language models in coding assistance tasks, covering code writing, debugging, code review, and conceptual understanding. Our main contribution includes two curated datasets: StackEval, a large-scale benchmark derived from Stack Overflow questions, and StackUnseen, a dynamic benchmark featuring the most recent Stack Overflow content. These benchmarks offer novel insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs, particularly in handling new and emerging content. Additionally, we assess LLMs' proficiency as judges for coding tasks using a curated, human-annotated dataset, exploring their evaluation capabilities and potential biases, including whether they favor their own generated solutions. Our findings underscore the potential of these benchmarks to advance LLM development and application in coding assistance. To ensure reproducibility, we publicly share our datasets and evaluation code at https://github.com/ProsusAI/stack-eval."
Poster,Stacking Your Transformers: A Closer Look at Model Growth for Efficient LLM Pre-Training,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95968,"Wenyu Du, Tongxu Luo, Zihan Qiu, Zeyu Huang, Yikang Shen, Reynold Cheng, Yike Guo, Jie Fu","LLMs are computationally expensive to pre-train due to their large scale.Model growth emerges as a promising approach by leveraging smaller models to accelerate the training of larger ones. However, the viability of these model growth methods in efficient LLM pre-training remains underexplored.This work identifies three critical $\underline{\textit{O}}$bstacles: ($\textit{O}$1) lack of comprehensive evaluation, ($\textit{O}$2) untested viability for scaling, and ($\textit{O}$3) lack of empirical guidelines.To tackle $\textit{O}$1, we summarize existing approaches into four atomic growth operators and systematically evaluate them in a standardized LLM pre-training setting.Our findings reveal that a depthwise stacking operator, called $G_{\text{stack}}$, exhibits remarkable acceleration in training, leading to decreased loss and improved overall performance on eight standard NLP benchmarks compared to strong baselines. Motivated by these promising results, we conduct extensive experiments to delve deeper into $G_{\text{stack}}$ to address $\textit{O}$2 and $\textit{O}$3.For $\textit{O}$2 (untested scalability), our study shows that $G_{\text{stack}}$ is scalable and consistently performs well, with experiments up to 7B LLMs after growth and pre-training LLMs with 750B tokens.For example, compared to a conventionally trained 7B model using 300B tokens, our $G_{\text{stack}}$ model converges to the same loss with 194B tokens, resulting in a 54.6\% speedup. We further address $\textit{O}$3 (lack of empirical guidelines) by formalizing guidelines to determine growth timing and growth factor for $G_{\text{stack}}$, making it practical in general LLM pre-training.We also provide in-depth discussions and comprehensive ablation studies of $G_{\text{stack}}$. Our code and pre-trained model are available at https://llm-stacking.github.io/."
Poster,Star-Agents: Automatic Data Optimization with LLM Agents for Instruction Tuning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93952,"Hang Zhou, Yehui Tang, Haochen Qin, Yujie Yang, Renren Jin, Deyi Xiong, Kai Han, Yunhe Wang","The efficacy of large language models (LLMs) on downstream tasks usually hinges on instruction tuning, which relies critically on the quality of training data. Unfortunately, collecting high-quality and diverse data is both expensive and time-consuming. To mitigate this issue, we propose  a novel Star-Agents framework, which automates the enhancement of data quality across datasets through multi-agent collaboration and assessment. The framework adopts a three-pronged strategy. It  initially generates diverse instruction data with multiple LLM agents through a bespoke sampling method. Subsequently, the generated data undergo a rigorous evaluation using a dual-model method that assesses both difficulty and quality. Finaly, the above process evolves in a dynamic refinement phase, where more effective LLMs are prioritized, enhancing the overall data quality. Our empirical studies, including instruction tuning experiments with models such as Pythia and LLaMA, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Optimized datasets have achieved substantial improvements, with an average increase of 12\% and notable gains in specific metrics, such as a 40\% improvement in Fermi, as evidenced by benchmarks like MT-bench, Vicuna bench, and WizardLM testset. Codes will be released soon."
Poster,STaRK: Benchmarking LLM Retrieval on Textual and Relational Knowledge Bases,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97698,"Shirley Wu, Shiyu Zhao, Michihiro Yasunaga, Kexin Huang, Kaidi Cao, Qian Huang, Vassilis Ioannidis, Karthik Subbian, James Zou, Jure Leskovec","Answering real-world complex queries, such as complex product search, often requires accurate retrieval from semi-structured knowledge bases that involve blend of unstructured (e.g., textual descriptions of products) and structured (e.g., entity relations of products) information. However, many previous works studied textual and relational retrieval tasks as separate topics. To address the gap, we develop STARK, a large-scale Semi-structure retrieval benchmark on Textual and Relational Knowledge Bases. Our benchmark covers three domains: product search, academic paper search, and queries in precision medicine. We design a novel pipeline to synthesize realistic user queries that integrate diverse relational information and complex textual properties, together with their ground-truth answers (items). We conduct rigorous human evaluation to validate the quality of our synthesized queries. We further enhance the benchmark with high-quality human-generated queries to provide an authentic reference. STARK serves as a comprehensive testbed for evaluating the performance of retrieval systems driven by large language models (LLMs). Our experiments suggest that STARK presents significant challenges to the current retrieval and LLM systems, highlighting the need for more capable semi-structured retrieval systems."
Poster,START: A Generalized State Space Model with Saliency-Driven Token-Aware Transformation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93769,"Jintao Guo, Lei Qi, Yinghuan Shi, Yang Gao","Domain Generalization (DG) aims to enable models to generalize to unseen target domains by learning from multiple source domains. Existing DG methods primarily rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which inherently learn texture biases due to their limited receptive fields, making them prone to overfitting source domains. While some works have introduced transformer-based methods (ViTs) for DG to leverage the global receptive field, these methods incur high computational costs due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. Recently, advanced state space models (SSMs), represented by Mamba, have shown promising results in supervised learning tasks by achieving linear complexity in sequence length during training and fast RNN-like computation during inference. Inspired by this, we investigate the generalization ability of the Mamba model under domain shifts and find that input-dependent matrices within SSMs could accumulate and amplify domain-specific features, thus hindering model generalization. To address this issue, we propose a novel SSM-based architecture with saliency-based token-aware transformation (namely START), which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances and offers a competitive alternative to CNNs and ViTs. Our START can selectively perturb and suppress domain-specific features in salient tokens within the input-dependent matrices of SSMs, thus effectively reducing the discrepancy between different domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that START outperforms existing SOTA DG methods with efficient linear complexity. Our code is available at https://github.com/lingeringlight/START."
Poster,State Chrono Representation for Enhancing Generalization in Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95738,"Jianda Chen, Wen zheng terence Ng, Zichen Chen, Sinno Pan, Tianwei Zhang","In reinforcement learning with image-based inputs, it is crucial to establish a robust and generalizable state representation. Recent advancements in metric learning, such as deep bisimulation metric approaches, have shown promising results in learning structured low-dimensional representation space from pixel observations, where the distance between states is measured based on task-relevant features. However, these approaches face challenges in demanding generalization tasks and scenarios with non-informative rewards. This is because they fail to capture sufficient long-term information in the learned representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel State Chrono Representation (SCR) approach. SCR augments state metric-based representations by incorporating extensive temporal information into the update step of bisimulation metric learning. It learns state distances within a temporal framework that considers both future dynamics and cumulative rewards over current and long-term future states. Our learning strategy effectively incorporates future behavioral information into the representation space without introducing a significant number of additional parameters for modeling dynamics. Extensive experiments conducted in DeepMind Control and Meta-World environments demonstrate that SCR achieves better performance comparing to other recent metric-based methods in demanding generalization tasks. The codes of SCR are available in https://github.com/jianda-chen/SCR."
Poster,State-free Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95101,"Mingyu Chen, Aldo Pacchiano, Xuezhou Zhang","In this work, we study the \textit{state-free RL} problem, where the algorithm does not have the states information before interacting with the environment. Specifically, denote the reachable state set by $\mathcal{S}^\Pi := \{ s|\max_{\pi\in \Pi}q^{P, \pi}(s)>0 \}$, we design an algorithm which requires no information on the state space $S$ while having a regret that is completely independent of $\mathcal{S}$ and only depend on $\mathcal{S}^\Pi$. We view this as a concrete first step towards \textit{parameter-free RL}, with the goal of designing RL algorithms that require no hyper-parameter tuning."
Poster,State Space Models on Temporal Graphs: A First-Principles Study,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94959,"Jintang Li, Ruofan Wu, Xinzhou Jin, Boqun Ma, Liang Chen, Zibin Zheng","Over the past few years, research on deep graph learning has shifted from static graphs to temporal graphs in response to real-world complex systems that exhibit dynamic behaviors. In practice, temporal graphs are formalized as an ordered sequence of static graph snapshots observed at discrete time points. Sequence models such as RNNs or Transformers have long been the predominant backbone networks for modeling such temporal graphs. Yet, despite the promising results, RNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while transformers are burdened by quadratic computational complexity. Recently, state space models (SSMs), which are framed as discretized representations of an underlying continuous-time linear dynamical system, have garnered substantial attention and achieved breakthrough advancements in independent sequence modeling. In this work, we undertake a principled investigation that extends SSM theory to temporal graphs by integrating structural information into the online approximation objective via the adoption of a Laplacian regularization term. The emergent continuous-time system introduces novel algorithmic challenges, thereby necessitating our development of GraphSSM, a graph state space model for modeling the dynamics of temporal graphs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our GraphSSM framework across various temporal graph benchmarks."
