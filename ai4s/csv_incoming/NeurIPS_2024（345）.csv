Poster,Reversing the Forget-Retain Objectives: An Efficient LLM Unlearning Framework from Logit Difference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93326,"Jiabao Ji, Yujian Liu, Yang Zhang, Gaowen Liu, Ramana Kompella, Sijia Liu, Shiyu Chang","As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate extensive capability in learning from documents, LLM unlearning becomes an increasingly important research area to address concerns of LLMs in terms of privacy, copyright, etc. A conventional LLM unlearning task typically involves two goals: (1) The target LLM should forget the knowledge in the specified forget documents; and (2) it should retain the other knowledge that the LLM possesses, for which we assume access to a small number of retain documents. To achieve both goals, a mainstream class of LLM unlearning methods introduces an optimization framework with a combination of two objectives – maximizing the prediction loss on the forget documents while minimizing that on the retain documents, which suffers from two challenges, degenerated output and catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose a novel unlearning framework called Unlearning from Logit Difference (ULD), which introduces an assistant LLM that aims to achieve the opposite of the unlearning goals: remembering the forget documents and forgetting the retain knowledge. ULD then derives the unlearned LLM by computing the logit difference between the target and the assistant LLMs. We show that such reversed objectives would naturally resolve both aforementioned challenges while significantly improving the training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method efficiently achieves the intended forgetting while preserving the LLM’s overall capabilities, reducing training time by more than threefold. Notably, our method loses 0% of model utility on the ToFU benchmark, whereas baseline methods may sacrifice 17% of utility on average to achieve comparable forget quality."
Poster,ReVideo: Remake a Video with Motion and Content Control,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93082,"Chong Mou, Mingdeng Cao, Xintao Wang, Zhaoyang Zhang, Ying Shan, Jian Zhang","Despite significant advancements in video generation and editing using diffusion models, achieving accurate and localized video editing remains a substantial challenge. Additionally, most existing video editing methods primarily focus on altering visual content, with limited research dedicated to motion editing. In this paper, we present a novel attempt to Remake a Video (ReVideo) which stands out from existing methods by allowing precise video editing in specific areas through the specification of both content and motion. Content editing is facilitated by modifying the first frame, while the trajectory-based motion control offers an intuitive user interaction experience. ReVideo addresses a new task involving the coupling and training imbalance between content and motion control. To tackle this, we develop a three-stage training strategy that progressively decouples these two aspects from coarse to fine. Furthermore, we propose a spatiotemporal adaptive fusion module to integrate content and motion control across various sampling steps and spatial locations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReVideo has promising performance on several accurate video editing applications, i.e., (1) locally changing video content while keeping the motion constant, (2) keeping content unchanged and customizing new motion trajectories, (3) modifying both content and motion trajectories. Our method can also seamlessly extend these applications to multi-area editing without specific training, demonstrating its flexibility and robustness."
Poster,Revisiting Adversarial Patches for Designing Camera-Agnostic Attacks against Person Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96825,"Hui Wei, Zhixiang Wang, Kewei Zhang, Jiaqi Hou, Yuanwei Liu, Hao Tang, Zheng Wang","Physical adversarial attacks can deceive deep neural networks (DNNs), leading to erroneous predictions in real-world scenarios. To uncover potential security risks, attacking the safety-critical task of person detection has garnered significant attention. However, we observe that existing attack methods overlook the pivotal role of the camera, involving capturing real-world scenes and converting them into digital images, in the physical adversarial attack workflow. This oversight leads to instability and challenges in reproducing these attacks. In this work, we revisit patch-based attacks against person detectors and introduce a camera-agnostic physical adversarial attack to mitigate this limitation. Specifically, we construct a differentiable camera Image Signal Processing (ISP) proxy network to compensate for the physical-to-digital transition gap. Furthermore, the camera ISP proxy network serves as a defense module, forming an adversarial optimization framework with the attack module. The attack module optimizes adversarial patches to maximize effectiveness, while the defense module optimizes the conditional parameters of the camera ISP proxy network to minimize attack effectiveness. These modules engage in an adversarial game, enhancing cross-camera stability. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Camera-Agnostic Patch (CAP) attack effectively conceals persons from detectors across various imaging hardware, including two distinct cameras and four smartphones."
Poster,"Revisiting, Benchmarking and Understanding Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97628,"Meihan Liu, Zhen Zhang, Jiachen Tang, Jiajun Bu, Bingsheng He, Sheng Zhou","Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) involves the transfer of knowledge from a label-rich source graph to an unlabeled target graph under domain discrepancies. Despite the proliferation of methods designed for this emerging task, the lack of standard experimental settings and fair performance comparisons makes it challenging to understand which and when models perform well across different scenarios. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for unsupervised graph domain adaptation named GDABench, which encompasses 16 algorithms across diverse adaptation tasks. Through extensive experiments, we observe that the performance of current UGDA models varies significantly across different datasets and adaptation scenarios. Specifically, we recognize that when the source and target graphs face significant distribution shifts, it is imperative to formulate strategies to effectively address and mitigate graph structural shifts. We also find that with appropriate neighbourhood aggregation mechanisms, simple GNN variants can even surpass state-of-the-art UGDA baselines. To facilitate reproducibility, we have developed an easy-to-use library PyGDA for training and evaluating existing UGDA methods, providing a standardized platform in this community. Our source codes and datasets can be found at https://github.com/pygda-team/pygda."
Poster,Revisiting Differentially Private ReLU Regression,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96706,"Meng Ding, Mingxi Lei, Liyang Zhu, Shaowei Wang, Di Wang, Jinhui Xu","As one of the most fundamental non-convex learning problems, ReLU regression under differential privacy (DP) constraints, especially in high-dimensional settings, remains a challenging area in privacy-preserving machine learning. Existing results are limited to the assumptions of bounded norm $ \|\mathbf{x}\|_2 \leq 1$, which becomes meaningless with increasing data dimensionality. In this work, we revisit the problem of DP ReLU regression in high-dimensional regimes. We propose two innovative algorithms DP-GLMtron and DP-TAGLMtron that outperform the conventional DPSGD. DP-GLMtron is based on a generalized linear model perceptron approach, integrating adaptive clipping and Gaussian mechanism for enhanced privacy. To overcome the constraints of small privacy budgets in DP-GLMtron, represented by $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{1/N})$ where $N$ is the sample size, we introduce DP-TAGLMtron, which utilizes a tree aggregation protocol to balance privacy and utility effectively, showing that DP-TAGLMtron achieves comparable performance with only an additional factor of $O(\log N)$ in the utility upper bound.Moreover, our theoretical analysis extends beyond Gaussian-like data distributions to settings with eigenvalue decay, showing how data distribution impacts learning in high dimensions. Notably, our findings suggest that the utility upper bound could be independent of the dimension $d$, even when $d \gg N$. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets also validate our results."
Poster,Revisiting Ensembling in One-Shot Federated Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96422,"Youssef Allouah, Akash Dhasade, Rachid Guerraoui, Nirupam Gupta, Anne-marie Kermarrec, Rafael Pinot, Rafael Pires, Rishi Sharma","Federated Learning (FL) is an appealing approach to training machine learning models without sharing raw data.  However, standard FL algorithms are iterative and thus induce a significant communication cost. One-Shot FL (OFL) trades the iterative exchange of models between clients and the server with a single round of communication, thereby saving substantially on communication costs. Not surprisingly, OFL exhibits a performance gap in terms of accuracy with respect to FL, especially under high data heterogeneity. We introduce Fens, a novel federated ensembling scheme that approaches the accuracy of FL with the communication efficiency of OFL. Learning in Fens proceeds in two phases: first, clients train models locally and send them to the server, similar to OFL; second, clients collaboratively train a lightweight prediction aggregator model using FL. We showcase the effectiveness of Fens through exhaustive experiments spanning several datasets and heterogeneity levels. In the particular case of heterogeneously distributed CIFAR-10 dataset, Fens achieves up to a $26.9$% higher accuracy over SOTA OFL, being only $3.1$%  lower than FL. At the same time, Fens incurs at most $4.3\times$ more communication than OFL, whereas FL is at least $10.9\times$ more communication-intensive than Fens."
Poster,Revisiting Few-Shot Object Detection with Vision-Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97860,"Anish Madan, Neehar Peri, Shu Kong, Deva Ramanan","The era of vision-language models (VLMs) trained on web-scale datasets challenges conventional formulations of “open-world"" perception. In this work, we revisit the task of few-shot object detection (FSOD) in the context of recent foundational VLMs. First, we point out that zero-shot predictions from VLMs such as GroundingDINO significantly outperform state-of-the-art few-shot detectors (48 vs. 33 AP) on COCO. Despite their strong zero-shot performance, such foundation models may still be sub-optimal. For example, trucks on the web may be defined differently from trucks for a target applications such as autonomous vehicle perception. We argue that the task of few-shot recognition can be reformulated as aligning foundation models to target concepts using a few examples. Interestingly, such examples can be multi-modal, using both text and visual cues, mimicking instructions that are often given to human annotators when defining a target concept of interest. Concretely, we propose Foundational FSOD, a new benchmark protocol that evaluates detectors pre-trained on any external data and fine-tuned on multi-modal (text and visual) K-shot examples per target class. We repurpose nuImages for Foundational FSOD, benchmark several popular open-source VLMs, and provide an empirical analysis of state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we discuss our recent CVPR 2024 Foundational FSOD competition and share insights from the community. Notably, the winning team significantly outperforms our baseline by 23.3 mAP!"
Poster,Revisiting K-mer Profile for Effective and Scalable Genome Representation Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96018,"Abdulkadir Celikkanat, Andres Masegosa, Thomas Nielsen","Obtaining effective representations of DNA sequences is crucial for genome analysis. Metagenomic binning, for instance, relies on genome representations to cluster complex mixtures of DNA fragments from biological samples with the aim of determining their microbial compositions. In this paper, we revisit k-mer-based representations of genomes and provide a theoretical analysis of their use in representation learning. Based on the analysis, we propose a lightweight and scalable model for performing metagenomic binning at the genome read level, relying only on the k-mer compositions of the DNA fragments. We compare the model to recent genome foundation models and demonstrate that while the models are comparable in performance, the proposed model is significantly more effective in terms of scalability, a crucial aspect for performing metagenomic binning of real-world data sets."
Poster,Revisiting motion information for RGB-Event tracking with MOT philosophy,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94452,"Tianlu Zhang, Kurt Debattista, Qiang Zhang, guiguang ding, Jungong Han","RGB-Event single object tracking (SOT) aims to leverage the merits of RGB and event data to achieve higher performance. However, existing frameworks focus on exploring complementary appearance information within multi-modal data, and struggle to address the association problem of targets and distractors in the temporal domain using motion information from the event stream. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) philosophy into RGB-E SOT to keep track of targets as well as distractors by using both RGB and event data, thereby improving the robustness of the tracker. Specifically, an appearance model is employed to predict the initial candidates. Subsequently, the initially predicted tracking results, in combination with the RGB-E features, are encoded into appearance and motion embeddings, respectively. Furthermore, a Spatial-Temporal Transformer Encoder is proposed to model the spatial-temporal relationships and learn discriminative features for each candidate through guidance of the appearance-motion embeddings. Simultaneously, a Dual-Branch Transformer Decoder is designed to adopt such motion and appearance information for candidate matching, thus distinguishing between targets and distractors. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance on all the datasets tested."
Poster,Revisiting Score Propagation in Graph Out-of-Distribution Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93946,"Longfei Ma, Yiyou Sun, Kaize Ding, Zemin Liu, Fei Wu","The field of graph learning has been substantially advanced by the development of deep learning models, in particular graph neural networks. However, one salient yet largely under-explored challenge is detecting Out-of-Distribution (OOD) nodes on graphs. Prevailing OOD detection techniques developed in other domains like computer vision, do not cater to the interconnected nature of graphs. This work aims to fill this gap by exploring the potential of a simple yet effective method -- OOD score propagation, which propagates OOD scores among neighboring nodes along the graph structure. This post hoc solution can be easily integrated with existing OOD scoring functions, showcasing its excellent flexibility and effectiveness in most scenarios. However, the conditions under which score propagation proves beneficial remain not fully elucidated. Our study meticulously derives these conditions and, inspired by this discovery, introduces an innovative edge augmentation strategy with theoretical guarantee. Empirical evaluations affirm the superiority of our proposed method, outperforming strong OOD detection baselines in various scenarios and settings."
