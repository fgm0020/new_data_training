Poster,A teacher-teacher framework for clinical language representation learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92966,"Feiqing Huang, Shenghan Zhang, Sara Sweet, Tianxi Cai","In recent years, there has been a proliferation of ready-to-use large language models (LLMs) designed for various applications, both general-purpose and domain-specific. Instead of advocating for the development of a new model or continuous pretraining of an existing one, this paper introduces a pragmatic teacher-teacher framework to facilitate mutual learning between two pre-existing models.By leveraging two teacher models possessing complementary knowledge, we introduce a LIghtweight kNowledge alignmEnt (LINE) module aimed at harmonizing their knowledge within a unified representation space. This framework is particularly valuable in clinical settings, where stringent regulations and privacy considerations dictate the handling of detailed clinical notes. Our trained LINE module excels in capturing critical information from clinical notes, leveraging highly de-identified data. Validation and downstream tasks further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework."
Poster,A Textbook Remedy for Domain Shifts: Knowledge Priors for Medical Image Analysis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95098,"Yue Yang, Mona Gandhi, Yufei Wang, Yifan Wu, Michael Yao, Chris Callison-Burch, James Gee, Mark Yatskar","While deep networks have achieved broad success in analyzing natural images, when applied to medical scans, they often fail in unexcepted situations. We investigate this challenge and focus on model sensitivity to domain shifts, such as data sampled from different hospitals or data confounded by demographic variables such as sex, race, etc, in the context of chest X-rays and skin lesion images. A key finding we show empirically is that existing visual backbones lack an appropriate prior from the architecture for reliable generalization in these settings. Taking inspiration from medical training, we propose giving deep networks a prior grounded in explicit medical knowledge communicated in natural language. To this end, we introduce Knowledge-enhanced Bottlenecks (KnoBo), a class of concept bottleneck models that incorporates knowledge priors that constrain it to reason with clinically relevant factors found in medical textbooks or PubMed. KnoBo uses retrieval-augmented language models to design an appropriate concept space paired with an automatic training procedure for recognizing the concept. We evaluate different resources of knowledge and recognition architectures on a broad range of domain shifts across 20 datasets. In our comprehensive evaluation with two imaging modalities, KnoBo outperforms fine-tuned models on confounded datasets by 32.4% on average. Finally, evaluations reveal that PubMed is a promising resource for making medical models less sensitive to domain shift, outperforming other resources on both diversity of information and final prediction performance."
Poster,A theoretical case-study of Scalable Oversight in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96710,"Tom Yan, Zachary Lipton","A key source of complexity in next-generation AI models is the size of model outputs, making it time-consuming to parse and provide reliable feedback on. To ensure such models are aligned, we will need to bolster our understanding of scalable oversight and how to scale up human feedback. To this end, we study the challenges of scalable oversight in the context of goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning. Hierarchical structure is a promising entrypoint into studying how to scale up human feedback, which in this work we assume can only be provided for model outputs below a threshold size. In the cardinal feedback setting, we develop an apt sub-MDP reward and algorithm that allows us to acquire and scale up low-level feedback for learning with sublinear regret. In the ordinal feedback setting, we show the necessity of both high- and low-level feedback, and develop a hierarchical experimental design algorithm that efficiently acquires both types of feedback for learning. Altogether, our work aims to consolidate the foundations of scalable oversight, formalizing and studying the various challenges thereof."
Poster,A theoretical design of concept sets: improving the predictability of concept bottleneck models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93623,"Max Ruiz Luyten, Mihaela van der Schaar","Concept-based learning, a promising approach in machine learning, emphasizes the value of high-level representations called concepts. However, despite growing interest in concept-bottleneck models (CBMs), there is a lack of clear understanding regarding the properties of concept sets and their impact on model performance. In this work, we define concepts within the machine learning context, highlighting their core properties: 'expressiveness' and 'model-aware inductive bias', and we make explicit the underlying assumption of CBMs. We establish theoretical results for concept-bottleneck models (CBMs), revealing how these properties guide the design of concept sets that optimize model performance. Specifically, we demonstrate that well-chosen concept sets can improve sample efficiency and out-of-distribution robustness in the appropriate regimes. Based on these insights, we propose a method to effectively identify informative and non-redundant concepts. We validate our approach with experiments on CIFAR-10 and MetaShift, showing that concept-bottleneck models outperform the foundational embedding counterpart, particularly in low-data regimes and under distribution shifts. We also examine failure modes and discuss how they can be tackled."
Poster,A Theoretical Perspective for Speculative Decoding Algorithm,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93154,"Ming Yin, Minshuo Chen, Kaixuan Huang, Mengdi Wang","Transformer-based autoregressive sampling has been the major bottleneck for slowing down large language model inferences. One effective way to accelerate inference is Speculative Decoding, which employs a small model to sample a sequence of draft tokens and a large model to validate. Given its empirical effectiveness, the theoretical understanding of Speculative Decoding is falling behind. This paper tackles this gap by conceptualizing the decoding problem via markov chain abstraction and studying the key properties, output quality and inference acceleration, from a theoretical perspective. Our analysis covers the theoretical limits of speculative decoding, batch algorithms, and output quality-inference acceleration tradeoffs. Our results reveal the fundamental connections between different components of LLMs via total variation distances and show how they jointly affect the efficiency of decoding algorithms."
Poster,A Theoretical Understanding of Self-Correction through In-context Alignment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95342,"Yifei Wang, Yuyang Wu, Zeming Wei, Stefanie Jegelka, Yisen Wang","Going beyond mimicking limited human experiences, recent studies show initial evidence that, like humans, large language models (LLMs) are capable of improving their abilities purely by self-correction, i.e., correcting previous responses through self-examination, as seen in models like OpenAI o1. Nevertheless, little is known about how such capabilities arise. In this work, based on a simplified setup akin to an alignment task, we theoretically analyze self-correction from an in-context learning perspective, showing that when LLMs give relatively accurate self-examinations as rewards, they are capable of refining responses in an in-context way. Notably, going beyond previous theories on over-simplified linear transformers, our theoretical construction underpins the roles of several key designs of realistic transformers for self-correction: softmax attention, multi-head attention, and the MLP block. We validate these findings extensively on synthetic datasets. Inspired by these findings, we propose a simple self-correction strategy, Checking as Context (CaC), which finds novel applications in alleviating social bias and defending against LLM jailbreaks. We believe that these findings will inspire further research on understanding, exploiting, and enhancing self-correction for building better foundation models.

Poster,A Theory of Optimistically Universal Online Learnability for General Concept Classes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96050,"Steve Hanneke, Hongao Wang","We provide a full characterization of the concept classes that are optimistically universally online learnable with {0, 1} labels. The notion of optimistically universal online learning was defined in [Hanneke, 2021] in order to understand learnability under minimal assumptions. In this paper, following the philosophy behind that work, we investigate two questions, namely, for every concept class: (1) What are the minimal assumptions on the data process admitting online learnability? (2) Is there a learning algorithm which succeeds under every data process satisfying the minimal assumptions? Such an algorithm is said to be optimistically universal for the given concept class. We resolve both of these questions for all concept classes, and moreover, as part of our solution we design general learning algorithms for each case. Finally, we extend these algorithms and results to the agnostic case, showing an equivalence between the minimal assumptions on the data process for learnability in the agnostic and realizable cases, for every concept class, as well as the equivalence of optimistically universal learnability."
Poster,Atlas3D: Physically Constrained Self-Supporting Text-to-3D for Simulation and Fabrication,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96557,"Yunuo Chen, Tianyi Xie, Zeshun Zong, Xuan Li, Feng Gao, Yin Yang, Ying Nian Wu, Chenfanfu Jiang","Existing diffusion-based text-to-3D generation methods primarily focus on producing visually realistic shapes and appearances, often neglecting the physical constraints necessary for downstream tasks. Generated models frequently fail to maintain balance when placed in physics-based simulations or 3D printed. This balance is crucial for satisfying user design intentions in interactive gaming, embodied AI, and robotics, where stable models are needed for reliable interaction. Additionally, stable models ensure that 3D-printed objects, such as figurines for home decoration, can stand on their own without requiring additional supports. To fill this gap, we introduce Atlas3D, an automatic and easy-to-implement method that enhances existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)-based text-to-3D tools. Atlas3D ensures the generation of self-supporting 3D models that adhere to physical laws of stability under gravity, contact, and friction. Our approach combines a novel differentiable simulation-based loss function with physically inspired regularization, serving as either a refinement or a post-processing module for existing frameworks. We verify Atlas3D's efficacy through extensive generation tasks and validate the resulting 3D models in both simulated and real-world environments."
Poster,A Topology-aware Graph Coarsening Framework for Continual Graph Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94876,"Xiaoxue Han, Zhuo Feng, Yue Ning","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) experience ""catastrophic forgetting"" in continual learning setups, where they tend to lose previously acquired knowledge and perform poorly on old tasks. Rehearsal-based methods, which consolidate old knowledge with a replay memory buffer, are a de facto solution due to their straightforward workflow. However, these methods often fail to adequately capture topological information, leading to incorrect input-label mappings in replay samples. To address this, we propose TACO, a topology-aware graph coarsening and continual learning framework that stores information from previous tasks as a reduced graph. Throughout each learning period, this reduced graph expands by integrating with a new graph and aligning shared nodes, followed by a ""zoom-out"" reduction process to maintain a stable size. We have developed a graph coarsening algorithm based on node representation proximities to efficiently reduce a graph while preserving essential topological information. We empirically demonstrate that the learning process on the reduced graph can closely approximate that on the original graph. We compare TACO with a wide range of state-of-the-art baselines, proving its superiority and the necessity of preserving high-quality topological information for effective replaying."
Poster,A Tractable Inference Perspective of Offline RL,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94960,"Xuejie Liu, Anji Liu, Guy Van den Broeck, Yitao Liang","A popular paradigm for offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks is to first fit the offline trajectories to a sequence model, and then prompt the model for actions that lead to high expected return. In addition to obtaining accurate sequence models, this paper highlights that tractability, the ability to exactly and efficiently answer various probabilistic queries, plays an important role in offline RL. Specifically, due to the fundamental stochasticity from the offline data-collection policies and the environment dynamics, highly non-trivial conditional/constrained generation is required to elicit rewarding actions. While it is still possible to approximate such queries, we observe that such crude estimates undermine the benefits brought by expressive sequence models. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes Trifle (Tractable Inference for Offline RL), which leverages modern tractable generative models to bridge the gap between good sequence models and high expected returns at evaluation time. Empirically, Trifle achieves $7$ state-of-the-art scores and the highest average scores in $9$ Gym-MuJoCo benchmarks against strong baselines. Further, Trifle significantly outperforms prior approaches in stochastic environments and safe RL tasks with minimum algorithmic modifications."
