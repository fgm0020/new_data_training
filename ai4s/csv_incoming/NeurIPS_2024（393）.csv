Poster,Tactile DreamFusion: Exploiting Tactile Sensing for 3D Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94226,"Ruihan Gao, Kangle Deng, Gengshan Yang, Wenzhen Yuan, Jun-Yan Zhu","3D generation methods have shown visually compelling results powered by diffusion image priors. However, they often fail to produce realistic geometric details, resulting in overly smooth surfaces or geometric details inaccurately baked in albedo maps. To address this, we introduce a new method that incorporates touch as an additional modality to improve the geometric details of generated 3D assets. We design a lightweight 3D texture field to synthesize visual and tactile textures, guided by 2D diffusion model priors on both visual and tactile domains. We condition the visual texture generation on high-resolution tactile normals and guide the patch-based tactile texture refinement with a customized TextureDreambooth. We further present a multi-part generation pipeline that enables us to synthesize different textures across various regions. To our knowledge, we are the first to leverage high-resolution tactile sensing to enhance geometric details for 3D generation tasks. We evaluate our method in both text-to-3D and image-to-3D settings. Our experiments demonstrate that our method provides customized and realistic fine geometric textures while maintaining accurate alignment between two modalities of vision and touch."
Poster,TAIA: Large Language Models are Out-of-Distribution Data Learners,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94733,"Shuyang Jiang, Yusheng Liao, Ya Zhang, Yanfeng Wang, Yu Wang","Fine-tuning on task-specific question-answer pairs is a predominant method for enhancing the performance of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) on downstream tasks. However, in certain specialized domains, such as healthcare or harmless content generation, it is nearly impossible to obtain a large volume of high-quality data that matches the downstream distribution. To improve the performance of LLMs in data-scarce domains with domain-mismatched data, we re-evaluated the Transformer architecture and discovered that not all parameter updates during fine-tuning contribute positively to downstream performance. Our analysis reveals that within the self-attention and feed-forward networks, only the fine-tuned attention parameters are particularly beneficial when the training set's distribution does not fully align with the test set. Based on this insight, we propose an effective inference-time intervention method: \uline{T}raining \uline{A}ll parameters but \uline{I}nferring with only \uline{A}ttention (TAIA). We empirically validate TAIA using two general instruction-tuning datasets and evaluate it on seven downstream tasks involving math, reasoning, and knowledge understanding across LLMs of different parameter sizes and fine-tuning techniques. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TAIA achieves superior improvements compared to both the fully fine-tuned model and the base model in most scenarios, with significant performance gains. The high tolerance of TAIA to data mismatches makes it resistant to jailbreaking tuning and enhances specialized tasks using general data.

Poster,Take A Shortcut Back: Mitigating the Gradient Vanishing for Training Spiking Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93065,"Yufei Guo, Yuanpei Chen, Zecheng Hao, Weihang Peng, Zhou Jie, Yuhan Zhang, Xiaode Liu, Zhe Ma","The Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is a biologically inspired neural network infrastructure that has recently garnered significant attention. It utilizes binary spike activations to transmit information, thereby replacing multiplications with additions and resulting in high energy efficiency. However, training an SNN directly poses a challenge due to the undefined gradient of the firing spike process. Although prior works have employed various surrogate gradient training methods that use an alternative function to replace the firing process during back-propagation, these approaches ignore an intrinsic problem: gradient vanishing. To address this issue, we propose a shortcut back-propagation method in the paper, which advocates for transmitting the gradient directly from the loss to the shallow layers. This enables us to present the gradient to the shallow layers directly, thereby significantly mitigating the gradient vanishing problem. Additionally, this method does not introduce any burden during the inference phase.To strike a balance between final accuracy and ease of training, we also propose an evolutionary training framework and implement it by inducing a balance coefficient that dynamically changes with the training epoch, which further improves the network's performance. Extensive experiments conducted over static and dynamic datasets using several popular network structures reveal that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
Poster,Talking Heads: Understanding Inter-Layer Communication in Transformer Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95588,"Jack Merullo, Carsten Eickhoff, Ellie Pavlick","Although it is known that transformer language models (LMs) pass features from early layers to later layers, it is not well understood how this information is represented and routed by the model. We analyze a mechanism used in two LMs to selectively inhibit items in a context in one task, and find that it underlies a commonly used abstraction across many context-retrieval behaviors. Specifically, we find that models write into low-rank subspaces of the residual stream to represent features which are then read out by later layers, forming low-rank *communication channels* (Elhage et al., 2021) between layers. A particular 3D subspace in model activations in GPT-2 can be traversed to positionally index items in lists, and we show that this mechanism can explain an otherwise arbitrary-seeming sensitivity of the model to the order of items in the prompt. That is, the model has trouble copying the correct information from context when many items ``crowd"" this limited space. By decomposing attention heads with the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), we find that previously described interactions between heads separated by one or more layers can be predicted via analysis of their weight matrices alone. We show that it is possible to manipulate the internal model representations as well as edit model weights based on the mechanism we discover in order to significantly improve performance on our synthetic Laundry List task, which requires recall from a list, often improving task accuracy by over 20\%. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly intricate interpretable structure learned from language model pretraining, and helps us understand why sophisticated LMs sometimes fail in simple domains, facilitating future analysis of more complex behaviors."
Poster,TALoS: Enhancing Semantic Scene Completion via Test-time Adaptation on the Line of Sight,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94132,"Hyun-Kurl Jang, Jihun Kim, Hyeokjun Kweon, Kuk-Jin Yoon","Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to perform geometric completion and semantic segmentation simultaneously. Despite the promising results achieved by existing studies, the inherently ill-posed nature of the task presents significant challenges in diverse driving scenarios. This paper introduces TALoS, a novel test-time adaptation approach for SSC that excavates the information available in driving environments. Specifically, we focus on that observations made at a certain moment can serve as Ground Truth (GT) for scene completion at another moment. Given the characteristics of the LiDAR sensor, an observation of an object at a certain location confirms both 1) the occupation of that location and 2) the absence of obstacles along the line of sight from the LiDAR to that point. TALoS utilizes these observations to obtain self-supervision about occupancy and emptiness, guiding the model to adapt to the scene in test time. In a similar manner, we aggregate reliable SSC predictions among multiple moments and leverage them as semantic pseudo-GT for adaptation. Further, to leverage future observations that are not accessible at the current time, we present a dual optimization scheme using the model in which the update is delayed until the future observation is available. Evaluations on the SemanticKITTI validation and test sets demonstrate that TALoS significantly improves the performance of the pre-trained SSC model."
Poster,Taming Cross-Domain Representation Variance in Federated Prototype Learning with Heterogeneous Data Domains,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96525,"Lei Wang, Jieming Bian, Letian Zhang, Chen Chen, Jie Xu","Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative machine learning training without sharing private data. While most FL methods assume identical data domains across clients, real-world scenarios often involve heterogeneous data domains. Federated Prototype Learning (FedPL) addresses this issue, using mean feature vectors as prototypes to enhance model generalization. However, existing FedPL methods create the same number of prototypes for each client, leading to cross-domain performance gaps and disparities for clients with varied data distributions. To mitigate cross-domain feature representation variance,  we introduce FedPLVM, which establishes variance-aware dual-level prototypes clustering and employs a novel $\alpha$-sparsity prototype loss. The dual-level prototypes clustering strategy creates local clustered prototypes based on private data features, then performs global prototypes clustering to reduce communication complexity and preserve local data privacy. The $\alpha$-sparsity prototype loss aligns samples from underrepresented domains, enhancing intra-class similarity and reducing inter-class similarity. Evaluations on Digit-5, Office-10, and DomainNet datasets demonstrate our method's superiority over existing approaches."
Poster,"Taming ""data-hungry"" reinforcement learning? Stability in continuous state-action spaces",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96136,"Yaqi Duan, Martin Wainwright","We introduce a novel framework for analyzing reinforcement learning (RL) in continuous state-action spaces, and use it to prove fast rates of convergence in both off-line and on-line settings. Our analysis highlights two key stability properties, relating to how changes in value functions and/or policies affect the Bellman operator and occupation measures. We argue that these properties are satisfied in many continuous state-action Markov decision processes. Our analysis also offers fresh perspectives on the roles of pessimism and optimism in off-line and on-line RL."
Poster,Taming Diffusion Prior for Image Super-Resolution with Domain Shift SDEs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93291,"qinpeng cui, yixuan liu, Xinyi Zhang, Qiqi Bao, Qingmin Liao, liwang Amd, Lu Tian, Zicheng Liu, Zhongdao Wang, Emad Barsoum","Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) models have attracted substantial interest due to their powerful image restoration capabilities. However, prevailing diffusion models often struggle to strike an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Typically, they either neglect to exploit the potential of existing extensive pretrained models, limiting their generative capacity, or they necessitate a dozens of forward passes starting from random noises, compromising inference efficiency. In this paper, we present DoSSR, a $\textbf{Do}$main $\textbf{S}$hift diffusion-based SR model that capitalizes on the generative powers of pretrained diffusion models while significantly enhancing efficiency by initiating the diffusion process with low-resolution (LR) images. At the core of our approach is a domain shift equation that integrates seamlessly with existing diffusion models. This integration not only improves the use of diffusion prior but also boosts inference efficiency. Moreover, we advance our method by transitioning the discrete shift process to a continuous formulation, termed as DoS-SDEs. This advancement leads to the fast and customized solvers that further enhance sampling efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, while notably requiring $\textbf{\emph{only 5 sampling steps}}$. Compared to previous diffusion prior based methods, our approach achieves a remarkable speedup of 5-7 times, demonstrating its superior efficiency."
Poster,Taming Generative Diffusion Prior for Universal Blind Image Restoration,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95426,"Siwei Tu, Weidong Yang, Ben Fei","Diffusion models have been widely utilized for image restoration. However, previous blind image restoration methods still need to assume the type of degradation model while leaving the parameters to be optimized, limiting their real-world applications. Therefore, we aim to tame generative diffusion prior for universal blind image restoration dubbed BIR-D, which utilizes an optimizable convolutional kernel to simulate the degradation model and dynamically update the parameters of the kernel in the diffusion steps, enabling it to achieve blind image restoration results even in various complex situations. Besides, based on mathematical reasoning, we have provided an empirical formula for the chosen of adaptive guidance scale, eliminating the need for a grid search for the optimal parameter. Experimentally, Our BIR-D has demonstrated superior practicality and versatility than off-the-shelf unsupervised methods across various tasks both on real-world and synthetic datasets, qualitatively and quantitatively. BIR-D is able to fulfill multi-guidance blind image restoration. Moreover, BIR-D can also restore images that undergo multiple and complicated degradations, demonstrating the practical applications. The code is available at https://github.com/Tusiwei/BIR-D."
Poster,Taming Heavy-Tailed Losses in Adversarial Bandits and the Best-of-Both-Worlds Setting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96657,"Duo Cheng, Xingyu Zhou, Bo Ji","In this paper, we study the multi-armed bandit problem in the best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) setting with heavy-tailed losses, where the losses can be negative and unbounded but have $(1+v)$-th raw moments bounded by $u^{1+v}$ for some known $u>0$ and $v\in(0,1]$. Specifically, we consider the BOBW setting where the underlying environment could be either (oblivious) adversarial (i.e., the loss distribution can change arbitrarily over time) or stochastic (i.e., the loss distribution is fixed over time) and is unknown to the decision-maker a prior, and propose an algorithm that achieves a $T^{\frac{1}{1+v}}$-type worst-case (pseudo-)regret in the adversarial regime and a $\log T$-type gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime, where $T$ is the time horizon. Compared to the state-of-the-art results, our algorithm offers stronger \emph{high-probability} regret guarantees rather than expected regret guarantees, and more importantly, relaxes a strong technical assumption on the loss distribution. This assumption is needed even for the weaker expected regret obtained in the literature and is generally hard to verify in practice. As a byproduct, relaxing this assumption leads to the first near-optimal regret result for heavy-tailed bandits with Huber contamination in the adversarial regime, in contrast to all previous works focused on the (easier) stochastic regime. Our result also implies a high-probability BOBW regret guarantee when the bounded true losses are protected with pure Local Differential Privacy (LDP), while the existing work ensures the (weaker) \emph{approximate} LDP with the regret bounds in expectation only."
