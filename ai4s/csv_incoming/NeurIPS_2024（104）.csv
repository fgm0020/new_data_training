Poster,DiffGS: Functional Gaussian Splatting Diffusion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96489,"Junsheng Zhou, Weiqi Zhang, Yu-Shen Liu","3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown convincing performance in rendering speed and fidelity, yet the generation of Gaussian Splatting remains a challenge due to its discreteness and unstructured nature. In this work, we propose DiffGS, a general Gaussian generator based on latent diffusion models. DiffGS is a powerful and efficient 3D generative model which is capable of generating Gaussian primitives at arbitrary numbers for high-fidelity rendering with rasterization. The key insight is to represent Gaussian Splatting in a disentangled manner via three novel functions to model Gaussian probabilities, colors and transforms. Through the novel disentanglement of 3DGS, we represent the discrete and unstructured 3DGS with continuous Gaussian Splatting functions, where we then train a latent diffusion model with the target of generating these Gaussian Splatting functions both unconditionally and conditionally. Meanwhile, we introduce a discretization algorithm to extract Gaussians at arbitrary numbers from the generated functions via octree-guided sampling and optimization. We explore DiffGS for various tasks, including unconditional generation, conditional generation from text, image, and partial 3DGS, as well as Point-to-Gaussian generation. We believe that DiffGS provides a new direction for flexibly modeling and generating Gaussian Splatting. Project page: https://junshengzhou.github.io/DiffGS."
Poster,DiffHammer: Rethinking the Robustness of Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94646,"Kaibo Wang, Xiaowen Fu, Yuxuan Han, Yang Xiang","Diffusion-based purification has demonstrated impressive robustness as an adversarial defense. However, concerns exist about whether this robustness arises from insufficient evaluation. Our research shows that EOT-based attacks face gradient dilemmas due to global gradient averaging, resulting in ineffective evaluations. Additionally, 1-evaluation underestimates resubmit risks in stochastic defenses. To address these issues, we propose an effective and efficient attack named DiffHammer. This method bypasses the gradient dilemma through selective attacks on vulnerable purifications, incorporating $N$-evaluation into loops and using gradient grafting for comprehensive and efficient evaluations. Our experiments validate that DiffHammer achieves effective results within 10-30 iterations, outperforming other methods. This calls into question the reliability of diffusion-based purification after mitigating the gradient dilemma and scrutinizing its resubmit risk."
Poster,DiffLight: A Partial Rewards Conditioned Diffusion Model for Traffic Signal Control with Missing Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96278,"Hanyang Chen, Yang Jiang, Shengnan Guo, Xiaowei Mao, Youfang Lin, Huaiyu Wan","The application of reinforcement learning in traffic signal control (TSC) has been extensively researched and yielded notable achievements. However, most existing works for TSC assume that traffic data from all surrounding intersections is fully and continuously available through sensors. In real-world applications, this assumption often fails due to sensor malfunctions or data loss, making TSC with missing data a critical challenge. To meet the needs of practical applications, we introduce DiffLight, a novel conditional diffusion model for TSC under data-missing scenarios in the offline setting. Specifically, we integrate two essential sub-tasks, i.e., traffic data imputation and decision-making, by leveraging a Partial Rewards Conditioned Diffusion (PRCD) model to prevent missing rewards from interfering with the learning process. Meanwhile, to effectively capture the spatial-temporal dependencies among intersections, we design a Spatial-Temporal transFormer (STFormer) architecture. In addition, we propose a Diffusion Communication Mechanism (DCM) to promote better communication and control performance under data-missing scenarios. Extensive experiments on five datasets with various data-missing scenarios demonstrate that DiffLight is an effective controller to address TSC with missing data. The code of DiffLight is released at https://github.com/lokol5579/DiffLight-release."
Poster,DiffNorm: Self-Supervised Normalization for Non-autoregressive Speech-to-speech Translation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95019,"Weiting Tan, Jingyu Zhang, Lingfeng Shen, Daniel Khashabi, Philipp Koehn","Non-autoregressive Transformers (NATs) are recently applied in direct speech-to-speech translation systems, which convert speech across different languages without intermediate text data. Although NATs generate high-quality outputs and offer faster inference than autoregressive models, they tend to produce incoherent and repetitive results due to complex data distribution (e.g., acoustic and linguistic variations in speech). In this work, we introduce DiffNorm, a diffusion-based normalization strategy that simplifies data distributions for training NAT models. After training with a self-supervised noise estimation objective, DiffNorm constructs normalized target data by denoising synthetically corrupted speech features. Additionally, we propose to regularize NATs with classifier-free guidance, improving model robustness and translation quality by randomly dropping out source information during training. Our strategies result in a notable improvement of about $+7$ ASR-BLEU for English-Spanish (En-Es) translation and $+2$ ASR-BLEU for English-French (En-Fr) on the CVSS benchmark, while attaining over $14\times$ speedup for En-Es and $5 \times$ speedup for En-Fr translations compared to autoregressive baselines."
Poster,DiffPano: Scalable and Consistent Text to Panorama Generation with Spherical Epipolar-Aware Diffusion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94707,"Weicai Ye, Chenhao Ji, Zheng Chen, Junyao Gao, Xiaoshui Huang, Song-Hai Zhang, Wanli Ouyang, Tong He, Cairong Zhao, Guofeng Zhang","Diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable achievements in 2D image or 3D object generation, however, the generation of 3D scenes and even $360^{\circ}$ images remains constrained, due to the limited number of scene datasets, the complexity of 3D scenes themselves, and the difficulty of generating consistent multi-view images. To address these issues, we first establish a large-scale panoramic video-text dataset containing millions of consecutive panoramic keyframes with corresponding panoramic depths, camera poses, and text descriptions. Then, we propose a novel text-driven panoramic generation framework, termed DiffPano, to achieve scalable, consistent, and diverse panoramic scene generation. Specifically, benefiting from the powerful generative capabilities of stable diffusion, we fine-tune a single-view text-to-panorama diffusion model with LoRA on the established panoramic video-text dataset. We further design a spherical epipolar-aware multi-view diffusion model to ensure the multi-view consistency of the generated panoramic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffPano can generate scalable, consistent, and diverse panoramic images with given unseen text descriptions and camera poses."
Poster,DiffPhyCon: A Generative Approach to Control Complex Physical Systems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95505,"Long Wei, Peiyan Hu, Ruiqi Feng, Haodong Feng, Yixuan Du, Tao Zhang, Rui Wang, Yue Wang, Zhi-Ming Ma, Tailin Wu","Controlling the evolution of complex physical systems is a fundamental task across science and engineering. Classical techniques suffer from limited applicability or huge computational costs. On the other hand, recent deep learning and reinforcement learning-based approaches often struggle to optimize long-term control sequences under the constraints of system dynamics. In this work, we introduce Diffusion Physical systems Control (DiffPhyCon), a new class of method to address the physical systems control problem. DiffPhyCon excels by simultaneously minimizing both the learned generative energy function and the predefined control objectives across the entire trajectory and control sequence. Thus, it can explore globally and plan near-optimal control sequences. Moreover, we enhance DiffPhyCon with prior reweighting, enabling the discovery of control sequences that significantly deviate from the training distribution. We test our method on three tasks: 1D Burgers' equation, 2D jellyfish movement control, and 2D high-dimensional smoke control, where our generated jellyfish dataset is released as a benchmark for complex physical system control research. Our method outperforms widely applied classical approaches and state-of-the-art deep learning and reinforcement learning methods. Notably, DiffPhyCon unveils an intriguing fast-close-slow-open pattern observed in the jellyfish, aligning with established findings in the field of fluid dynamics.

Poster,DiffPO: A causal diffusion model for learning distributions of potential outcomes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93743,"Yuchen Ma, Valentyn Melnychuk, Jonas Schweisthal, Stefan Feuerriegel","Predicting potential outcomes of interventions from observational data is crucial for decision-making in medicine, but the task is challenging due to the fundamental problem of causal inference. Existing methods are largely limited to point estimates of potential outcomes with no uncertain quantification; thus, the full information about the distributions of potential outcomes is typically ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel causal diffusion model called DiffPO, which is carefully designed for reliable inferences in medicine by learning the distribution of potential outcomes. In our DiffPO, we leverage a tailored conditional denoising diffusion model to learn complex distributions, where we address the selection bias through a novel orthogonal diffusion loss. Another strength of our DiffPO method is that it is highly flexible (e.g., it can also be used to estimate different causal quantities such as CATE). Across a wide range of experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance."
Poster,DiffSF: Diffusion Models for Scene Flow Estimation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93701,"Yushan Zhang, Bastian Wandt, Maria Magnusson, Michael Felsberg","Scene flow estimation is an essential ingredient for a variety of real-world applications, especially for autonomous agents, such as self-driving cars and robots. While recent scene flow estimation approaches achieve reasonable accuracy, their applicability to real-world systems additionally benefits from a reliability measure. Aiming at improving accuracy while additionally providing an estimate for uncertainty, we propose DiffSF that combines transformer-based scene flow estimation with denoising diffusion models. In the diffusion process, the ground truth scene flow vector field is gradually perturbed by adding Gaussian noise. In the reverse process, starting from randomly sampled Gaussian noise, the scene flow vector field prediction is recovered by conditioning on a source and a target point cloud. We show that the diffusion process greatly increases the robustness of predictions compared to prior approaches resulting in state-of-the-art performance on standard scene flow estimation benchmarks. Moreover, by sampling multiple times with different initial states, the denoising process predicts multiple hypotheses, which enables measuring the output uncertainty, allowing our approach to detect a majority of the inaccurate predictions. The code is available at https://github.com/ZhangYushan3/DiffSF."
Poster,DiffTORI: Differentiable Trajectory Optimization for Deep Reinforcement and Imitation Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95479,"Weikang Wan, Ziyu Wang, Yufei Wang, Zackory Erickson, David Held","This paper introduces DiffTORI, which utilizes $\textbf{Diff}$erentiable $\textbf{T}$rajectory $\textbf{O}$ptimization as the policy representation to generate actions for deep $\textbf{R}$einforcement and $\textbf{I}$mitation learning. Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization.  As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the “objective mismatch” issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI  for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feedforward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains."
Poster,DiffuBox: Refining 3D Object Detection with Point Diffusion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95740,"Xiangyu Chen, Zhenzhen Liu, Katie Luo, Siddhartha Datta, Adhitya Polavaram, Yan Wang, Yurong You, Boyi Li, Marco Pavone, Wei-Lun (Harry) Chao, Mark Campbell, Bharath Hariharan, Kilian Weinberger","Ensuring robust 3D object detection and localization is crucial for many applications in robotics and autonomous driving. Recent models, however, face difficulties in maintaining high performance when applied to domains with differing sensor setups or geographic locations, often resulting in poor localization accuracy due to domain shift. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel diffusion-based box refinement approach. This method employs a domain-agnostic diffusion model, conditioned on the LiDAR points surrounding a coarse bounding box, to simultaneously refine the box's location, size, and orientation. We evaluate this approach under various domain adaptation settings, and our results reveal significant improvements across different datasets, object classes and detectors. Our PyTorch implementation is available at https://github.com/cxy1997/DiffuBox."
