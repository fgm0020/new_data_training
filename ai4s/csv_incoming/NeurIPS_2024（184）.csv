Poster,Hierarchical Programmatic Option Framework,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95954,"Yu-An Lin, Chen-Tao Lee, Chih-Han Yang, Guan-Ting Liu, Shao-Hua Sun","Deep reinforcement learning aims to learn deep neural network policies to solve large-scale decision-making problems. However, approximating policies using deep neural networks makes it difficult to interpret the learned decision-making process. To address this issue, prior works (Trivedi et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023; Carvalho et al., 2024) proposed to use human-readable programs as policies to increase the interpretability of the decision-making pipeline. Nevertheless, programmatic policies generated by these methods struggle to effectively solve long and repetitive RL tasks and cannot generalize to even longer horizons during testing. To solve these problems, we propose the Hierarchical Programmatic Option framework (HIPO), which aims to solve long and repetitive RL problems with human-readable programs as options (low-level policies). Specifically, we propose a method that retrieves a set of effective, diverse, and compatible programs as options. Then, we learn a high-level policy to effectively reuse these programmatic options to solve reoccurring subtasks. Our proposed framework outperforms programmatic RL and deep RL baselines on various tasks. Ablation studies justify the effectiveness of our proposed search algorithm for retrieving a set of programmatic options."
Poster,Hierarchical Selective Classification,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93110,"Shani Goren, Ido Galil, Ran El-Yaniv","Deploying deep neural networks for risk-sensitive tasks necessitates an uncertainty estimation mechanism. This paper introduces *hierarchical selective classification*, extending selective classification to a hierarchical setting. Our approach leverages the inherent structure of class relationships, enabling models to reduce the specificity of their predictions when faced with uncertainty. In this paper, we first formalize hierarchical risk and coverage, and introduce hierarchical risk-coverage curves. Next, we develop algorithms for hierarchical selective classification (which we refer to as ""inference rules""), and propose an efficient algorithm that guarantees a target accuracy constraint with high probability. Lastly, we conduct extensive empirical studies on over a thousand ImageNet classifiers, revealing that training regimes such as CLIP, pretraining on ImageNet21k and knowledge distillation boost hierarchical selective performance."
Poster,Hierarchical Uncertainty Exploration via Feedforward Posterior Trees,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94955,"Elias Nehme, Rotem Mulayoff, Tomer Michaeli","When solving ill-posed inverse problems, one often desires to explore the space of potential solutions rather than be presented with a single plausible reconstruction. Valuable insights into these feasible solutions and their associated probabilities are embedded in the posterior distribution. However, when confronted with data of high dimensionality (such as images), visualizing this distribution becomes a formidable challenge, necessitating the application of effective summarization techniques before user examination. In this work, we introduce a new approach for visualizing posteriors across multiple levels of granularity using *tree*-valued predictions. Our method predicts a tree-valued hierarchical summarization of the posterior distribution for any input measurement, in a single forward pass of a neural network. We showcase the efficacy of our approach across diverse datasets and image restoration challenges, highlighting its prowess in uncertainty quantification and visualization. Our findings reveal that our method performs comparably to a baseline that hierarchically clusters samples from a diffusion-based posterior sampler, yet achieves this with orders of magnitude greater speed.

Poster,Hierarchical Visual Feature Aggregation for OCR-Free Document Understanding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95304,"JaeYoo Park, Jin Young Choi, Jeonghyung Park, Bohyung Han","We present a novel OCR-free document understanding framework based on pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our approach employs multi-scale visual features to effectively handle various font sizes within document images.To address the increasing costs of considering the multi-scale visual inputs for MLLMs, we propose the Hierarchical Visual Feature Aggregation (HVFA) module, designed to reduce the number of input tokens to LLMs. Leveraging a feature pyramid with cross-attentive pooling, our approach effectively manages the trade-off between information loss and efficiency without being affected by varying document image sizes.Furthermore, we introduce a novel instruction tuning task, which facilitates the model's text-reading capability by learning to predict the relative positions of input text, eventually minimizing the risk of truncated text caused by the limited capacity of LLMs.Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating superior performance in various document understanding tasks."
Poster,Hierarchy-Agnostic Unsupervised Segmentation: Parsing Semantic Image Structure,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96040,"Simone Rossetti, Fiora Pirri","Unsupervised semantic segmentation aims to discover groupings within images, capturing objects' view-invariance without external supervision. Moreover, this task is inherently ambiguous due to the varying levels of semantic granularity. Existing methods often bypass this ambiguity using dataset-specific priors. In our research, we address this ambiguity head-on and provide a universal tool for pixel-level semantic parsing of images guided by the latent representations encoded in self-supervised models. We introduce a novel algebraic approach that recursively decomposes an image into nested subgraphs, dynamically estimating their count and ensuring clear separation.The innovative approach identifies scene-specific primitives and constructs a hierarchy-agnostic tree of semantic regions from the image pixels. The model captures fine and coarse semantic details, producing a nuanced and unbiased segmentation. We present a new metric for estimating the quality of the semantic segmentation of discovered elements on different levels of the hierarchy. The metric validates the intrinsic nature of the compositional relations among parts, objects, and scenes in a hierarchy-agnostic domain. Our results prove the power of this methodology, uncovering semantic regions without prior definitions and scaling effectively across various datasets. This robust framework for unsupervised image segmentation proves more accurate semantic hierarchical relationships between scene elements than traditional algorithms. The experiments underscore its potential for broad applicability in image analysis tasks, showcasing its ability to deliver a detailed and unbiased segmentation that surpasses existing unsupervised methods."
Poster,High-dimensional (Group) Adversarial Training in Linear Regression,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95011,"Yiling Xie, Xiaoming Huo","Adversarial training can achieve robustness against adversarial perturbations and has been widely used in machine-learning models. This paper delivers a non-asymptotic consistency analysis of the adversarial training procedure under $\ell_\infty$-perturbation in high-dimensional linear regression. It will be shown that, under the restricted eigenvalue condition, the associated convergence rate of prediction error can achieve the minimax rate up to a logarithmic factor in the high-dimensional linear regression on the class of sparse parameters. Additionally, the group adversarial training procedure is analyzed. Compared with classic adversarial training, it will be proved that the group adversarial training procedure enjoys a better prediction error upper bound under certain group-sparsity patterns."
Poster,Higher-Order Causal Message Passing for Experimentation with Complex Interference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96704,"Mohsen Bayati, Yuwei Luo, William Overman, Mohamad Sadegh Shirani Faradonbeh, Ruoxuan Xiong","Accurate estimation of treatment effects is essential for decision-making across various scientific fields. This task, however, becomes challenging in areas like social sciences and online marketplaces, where treating one experimental unit can influence outcomes for others through direct or indirect interactions. Such interference can lead to biased treatment effect estimates, particularly when the structure of these interactions is unknown. We address this challenge by introducing a new class of estimators based on causal message-passing, specifically designed for settings with pervasive, unknown interference. Our estimator draws on information from the sample mean and variance of unit outcomes and treatments over time, enabling efficient use of observed data to estimate the evolution of the system state. Concretely, we construct non-linear features from the moments of unit outcomes and treatments and then learn a function that maps these features to future mean and variance of unit outcomes. This allows for the estimation of the treatment effect over time. Extensive simulations across multiple domains, using synthetic and real network data, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in estimating total treatment effect dynamics, even in cases where interference exhibits non-monotonic behavior in the probability of treatment."
Poster,Higher-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensors for Equivariant Message Passing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94197,"Viktor Zaverkin, Francesco Alesiani, Takashi Maruyama, Federico Errica, Henrik Christiansen, Makoto Takamoto, Nicolas Weber, Mathias Niepert","The ability to perform fast and accurate atomistic simulations is crucial for advancing the chemical sciences. By learning from high-quality data, machine-learned interatomic potentials achieve accuracy on par with ab initio and first-principles methods at a fraction of their computational cost. The success of machine-learned interatomic potentials arises from integrating inductive biases such as equivariance to group actions on an atomic system, e.g., equivariance to rotations and reflections. In particular, the field has notably advanced with the emergence of equivariant message passing. Most of these models represent an atomic system using spherical tensors, tensor products of which require complicated numerical coefficients and can be computationally demanding. Cartesian tensors offer a promising alternative, though state-of-the-art methods lack flexibility in message-passing mechanisms, restricting their architectures and expressive power. This work explores higher-rank irreducible Cartesian tensors to address these limitations. We integrate irreducible Cartesian tensor products into message-passing neural networks and prove the equivariance and traceless property of the resulting layers. Through empirical evaluations on various benchmark data sets, we consistently observe on-par or better performance than that of state-of-the-art spherical and Cartesian models."
Poster,High-probability complexity bounds for stochastic non-convex minimax optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94774,"Yassine Laguel, Yasa Syed, Necdet Serhat Aybat, Mert Gurbuzbalaban","Stochastic smooth nonconvex minimax problems are prevalent in machine learning, e.g., GAN training, fair classification, and distributionally robust learning. Stochastic gradient descent ascent (GDA)-type methods are popular in practice due to their simplicity and single-loop nature. However, there is a significant gap between the theory and practice regarding high-probability complexity guarantees for these methods on stochastic nonconvex minimax problems. Existing high-probability bounds for GDA-type single-loop methods only apply to convex/concave minimax problems and to particular non-monotone variational inequality problems under some restrictive assumptions. In this work, we address this gap by providing the first high-probability complexity guarantees for nonconvex/PL minimax problems corresponding to a smooth function that satisfies the PL-condition in the dual variable. Specifically, we show that when the stochastic gradients are light-tailed, the smoothed alternating GDA method can compute an $\varepsilon$-stationary point within $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\ell \kappa^2 \delta^2}{\varepsilon^4} + \frac{\kappa}{\varepsilon^2}(\ell+\delta^2\log({1}/{\bar{q}})))$ stochastic gradient calls with probability at least $1-\bar{q}$ for any $\bar{q}\in(0,1)$, where $\mu$ is the PL constant, $\ell$ is the Lipschitz constant of the gradient, $\kappa=\ell/\mu$ is the condition number, and $\delta^2$ denotes a bound on the variance of stochastic gradients. We also present numerical results on a nonconvex/PL problem with synthetic data and on distributionally robust optimization problems with real data, illustrating our theoretical findings."
Poster,High Rank Path Development: an approach to learning the filtration of stochastic processes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93179,"Jiajie Tao, Hao Ni, Chong Liu","Since the weak convergence for stochastic processes does not account for the growth of information over time which is represented by the underlying filtration, a slightly erroneous stochastic model in weak topology may cause huge loss in multi-periods decision making problems. To address such discontinuities, Aldous introduced the extended weak convergence, which can fully characterise all essential properties, including the filtration, of stochastic processes; however, it was considered to be hard to find efficient numerical implementations. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric called High Rank PCF Distance (HRPCFD) for extended weak convergence based on the high rank path development method from rough path theory, which also defines the characteristic function for measure-valued processes. We then show that such HRPCFD admits many favourable analytic properties which allows us to design an efficient algorithm for training HRPCFD from data and construct the HRPCF-GAN by using HRPCFD as the discriminator for conditional time series generation. Our numerical experiments on both hypothesis testing and generative modelling validate the out-performance of our approach compared with several state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential in broad applications of synthetic time series generation and in addressing classic financial and economic challenges, such as optimal stopping or utility maximisation problems.
