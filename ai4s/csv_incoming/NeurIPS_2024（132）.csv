Poster,Enhancing Large Language Models through Adaptive Tokenizers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96759,"Mengyu Zheng, Hanting Chen, Tianyu Guo, Chong Zhu, Binfan Zheng, Chang Xu, Yunhe Wang","Tokenizers serve as crucial interfaces between models and linguistic data, substantially influencing the efficacy and precision of large language models (LLMs). Traditional tokenization methods often rely on static frequency-based statistics and are not inherently synchronized with LLM architectures, which may limit model performance. In this study, we propose a simple but effective method to learn tokenizers specifically engineered for seamless integration with LLMs. Initiating with a broad initial vocabulary, we refine our tokenizer by monitoring changes in the model’s perplexity during training, allowing for the selection of a tokenizer that is closely aligned with the model’s evolving dynamics. Through iterative refinement, we develop an optimized tokenizer. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that this adaptive approach significantly enhances accuracy compared to conventional methods, maintaining comparable vocabulary sizes and affirming its potential to improve LLM functionality."
Poster,Enhancing Large Vision Language Models with Self-Training on Image Comprehension,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95961,"Yihe Deng, Pan Lu, Fan Yin, Ziniu Hu, Sheng Shen, Quanquan Gu, James Zou, Kai-Wei Chang, Wei Wang","Large vision language models (LVLMs) integrate large language models (LLMs) with pre-trained vision encoders, thereby activating the perception capability of the model to understand image inputs for different queries and conduct subsequent reasoning. Improving this capability requires high-quality vision-language data, which is costly and labor-intensive to acquire. Self-training approaches have been effective in single-modal settings to alleviate the need for labeled data by leveraging model's own generation. However, effective self-training remains a challenge regarding the unique visual perception and reasoning capability of LVLMs. To address this, we introduce **S**elf-**T**raining on **I**mage **C**omprehension (**STIC**), which emphasizes a self-training approach specifically for image comprehension. First, the model self-constructs a preference dataset for image descriptions using unlabeled images. Preferred responses are generated through a step-by-step prompt, while dis-preferred responses are generated from either corrupted images or misleading prompts. To further self-improve reasoning on the extracted visual information, we let the model reuse a small portion of existing instruction-tuning data and append its self-generated image descriptions to the prompts. We validate the effectiveness of STIC across seven different benchmarks, demonstrating substantial performance gains of 4.0% on average while using 70% less supervised fine-tuning data than the current method. Further studies dive into various components of STIC and highlight its potential to leverage vast quantities of unlabeled images for self-training."
Poster,Enhancing LLM Reasoning via Vision-Augmented Prompting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95453,"Ziyang Xiao, Dongxiang Zhang, Xiongwei Han, Xiaojin Fu, Wing Yin YU, Tao Zhong, Sai Wu, Yuan Wang, Jianwei Yin, Gang Chen","Verbal and visual-spatial information processing are two critical subsystems that activate different brain regions and often collaborate together for cognitive reasoning. Despite the rapid advancement of LLM-based reasoning, the mainstream frameworks, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants, primarily focus on the verbal dimension, resulting in limitations in tackling reasoning problems with visual and spatial clues. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel dual-modality reasoning framework called Vision-Augmented Prompting (VAP). Upon receiving a textual problem description, VAP automatically synthesizes an image from the visual and spatial clues by utilizing external drawing tools. Subsequently, VAP formulates a chain of thought in both modalities and iteratively refines the synthesized image. Finally, a conclusive reasoning scheme based on self-alignment is proposed for final result generation. Extensive experiments are conducted across four versatile tasks, including solving geometry problems, Sudoku, time series prediction, and travelling salesman problem. The results validated the superiority of VAP over existing LLMs-based reasoning frameworks."
Poster,Enhancing LLM’s Cognition via Structurization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93516,"Kai Liu, Zhihang Fu, Chao Chen, Wei Zhang, Rongxin Jiang, Fan Zhou, Yaowu Chen, Yue Wu, Jieping Ye","When reading long-form text, human cognition is complex and structurized. While large language models (LLMs) process input contexts through a causal and sequential perspective, this approach can potentially limit their ability to handle intricate and complex inputs effectively. To enhance LLM’s cognition capability, this paper presents a novel concept of context structurization. Specifically, we transform the plain, unordered contextual sentences into well-ordered and hierarchically structurized elements. By doing so, LLMs can better grasp intricate and extended contexts through precise attention and information-seeking along the organized structures. Extensive evaluations are conducted across various model architectures and sizes (including a series of auto-regressive LLMs as well as BERT-like masking models) on a diverse set of NLP tasks (e.g., context-based question-answering, exhaustive hallucination evaluation, and passage-level dense retrieval). Empirical results show consistent and significant performance gains afforded by a single-round structurization. In particular, we boost the open-sourced LLaMA2-70B model to achieve comparable performance against GPT-3.5-Turbo as the halluci- nation evaluator. Besides, we show the feasibility of distilling advanced LLMs’ language processing abilities to a smaller yet effective StruXGPT-7B to execute structurization, addressing the practicality of our approach.

Poster,Enhancing Motion in Text-to-Video Generation with Decomposed Encoding and Conditioning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93667,"PENGHUI RUAN, Pichao WANG, Divya Saxena, Jiannong Cao, Yuhui Shi","Despite advancements in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation, producing videos with realistic motion remains challenging. Current models often yield static or minimally dynamic outputs, failing to capture complex motions described by text. This issue stems from the internal biases in text encoding which overlooks motions, and inadequate conditioning mechanisms in T2V generation models. To address this, we propose a novel framework called DEcomposed MOtion (DEMO), which enhances motion synthesis in T2V generation by decomposing both text encoding and conditioning into content and motion components. Our method includes a content encoder for static elements and a motion encoder for temporal dynamics, alongside separate content and motion conditioning mechanisms. Crucially, we introduce text-motion and video-motion supervision to improve the model's understanding and generation of motion. Evaluations on benchmarks such as MSR-VTT, UCF-101, WebVid-10M, EvalCrafter, and VBench demonstrate DEMO's superior ability to produce videos with enhanced motion dynamics while maintaining high visual quality. Our approach significantly advances T2V generation by integrating comprehensive motion understanding directly from textual descriptions. Project page: https://PR-Ryan.github.io/DEMO-project/"
Poster,Enhancing Multiple Dimensions of Trustworthiness in LLMs via Sparse Activation Control,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94553,"Yuxin Xiao, Wan Chaoqun, Yonggang Zhang, Wenxiao Wang, Binbin Lin, Xiaofei He, Xu Shen, Jieping Ye","As the development and application of Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly, enhancing their trustworthiness and aligning them with human preferences has become a critical area of research. Traditional methods rely heavily on extensive data for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), but representation engineering offers a new, training-free approach. This technique leverages semantic features to control the representation of LLM's intermediate hidden states, enabling the model to meet specific requirements such as increased honesty or heightened safety awareness. However, a significant challenge arises when attempting to fulfill multiple requirements simultaneously. It proves difficult to encode various semantic contents, like honesty and safety, into a singular semantic feature, restricting its practicality.In this work, we address this challenge through Sparse Activation Control. By delving into the intrinsic mechanisms of LLMs, we manage to identify and pinpoint modules that are closely related to specific tasks within the model, i.e. attention heads. These heads display sparse characteristics that allow for near-independent control over different tasks. Our experiments, conducted on the open-source Llama series models, have yielded encouraging results. The models were able to align with human preferences on issues of safety, factualness, and bias concurrently."
Poster,Enhancing Preference-based Linear Bandits via Human Response Time,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94568,"Shen Li, Yuyang Zhang, Zhaolin Ren, Claire Liang, Na Li, Julie A Shah","Interactive preference learning systems infer human preferences by presenting queries as pairs of options and collecting binary choices. Although binary choices are simple and widely used, they provide limited information about preference strength. To address this, we leverage human response times, which are inversely related to preference strength, as an additional signal. We propose a computationally efficient method that combines choices and response times to estimate human utility functions, grounded in the EZ diffusion model from psychology. Theoretical and empirical analyses show that for queries with strong preferences, response times complement choices by providing extra information about preference strength, leading to significantly improved utility estimation. We incorporate this estimator into preference-based linear bandits for fixed-budget best-arm identification. Simulations on three real-world datasets demonstrate that using response times significantly accelerates preference learning compared to choice-only approaches.

Poster,Enhancing Protein Mutation Effect Prediction through a Retrieval-Augmented Framework,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95577,"Ruihan Guo, Rui Wang, Ruidong Wu, Zhizhou Ren, Jiahan Li, Shitong Luo, Zuofan Wu, Qiang Liu, Jian Peng, Jianzhu Ma","Predicting the effects of protein mutations is crucial for analyzing protein functions and understanding genetic diseases. However, existing models struggle to effectively extract mutation-related local structure motifs from protein databases, which hinders their predictive accuracy and robustness. To tackle this problem, we design a novel retrieval-augmented framework for incorporating similar structure information in known protein structures. We create a vector database consisting of local structure motif embeddings from a pre-trained protein structure encoder, which allows for efficient retrieval of similar local structure motifs during mutation effect prediction. Our findings demonstrate that leveraging this method results in the SOTA performance across multiple protein mutation prediction datasets, and offers a scalable solution for studying mutation effects."
Poster,Enhancing Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs via Principled Synthetic Logic Corpus,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93733,"Terufumi Morishita, Gaku Morio, Atsuki Yamaguchi, Yasuhiro Sogawa","Large language models (LLMs) are capable of solving a wide range of tasks, yet they have struggled with reasoning.To address this, we propose $\textbf{Additional Logic Training (ALT)}$, which aims to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities by program-generated logical reasoning samples.We first establish principles for designing high-quality samples by integrating symbolic logic theory and previous empirical insights.Then, based on these principles, we construct a synthetic corpus named $\textbf{Formal} \ \textbf{Logic} \ \textbf{\textit{D}eduction} \ \textbf{\textit{D}iverse}$ (FLD$ _{\times2}$), comprising numerous samples of multi-step deduction with unknown facts, diverse reasoning rules, diverse linguistic expressions, and challenging distractors.Finally, we empirically show that ALT on FLD$ _{\times2}$ substantially enhances the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, including LLaMA-3.1-70B.Improvements include gains of up to 30 points on logical reasoning benchmarks, up to 10 points on math and coding benchmarks, and 5 points on the benchmark suite BBH."
Poster,Enhancing Robustness in Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Lyapunov Exponent Approach,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95847,"Rory Young, Nicolas Pugeault","Deep reinforcement learning agents achieve state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of simulated control tasks. However, successful applications to real-world problems remain limited. One reason for this dichotomy is because the learnt policies are not robust to observation noise or adversarial attacks. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of deep RL policies to a single small state perturbation in deterministic continuous control tasks. We demonstrate that RL policies can be deterministically chaotic, as small perturbations to the system state have a large impact on subsequent state and reward trajectories. This unstable non-linear behaviour has two consequences: first, inaccuracies in sensor readings, or adversarial attacks, can cause significant performance degradation; second, even policies that show robust performance in terms of rewards may have unpredictable behaviour in practice. These two facets of chaos in RL policies drastically restrict the application of deep RL to real-world problems. To address this issue, we propose an improvement on the successful Dreamer V3 architecture, implementing Maximal Lyapunov Exponent regularisation. This new approach reduces the chaotic state dynamics, rendering the learnt policies more resilient to sensor noise or adversarial attacks and thereby improving the suitability of deep reinforcement learning for real-world applications."
