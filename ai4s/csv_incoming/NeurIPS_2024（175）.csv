Poster,Grammar-Aligned Decoding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96599,"Kanghee Park, Jiayu Wang, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Nadia Polikarpova, Loris D&#x27;Antoni","Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with reliably generating highly structured outputs, such as program code, mathematical formulas, or well-formed markup. Constrained decoding approaches mitigate this problem by greedily restricting what tokens an LLM can output at each step to guarantee that the output matches a given constraint. Specifically, in grammar-constrained decoding (GCD), the LLM's output must follow a given grammar. In this paper we demonstrate that GCD techniques (and in general constrained decoding techniques) can distort the LLM's distribution, leading to outputs that are grammatical but appear with likelihoods that are not proportional to the ones given by the LLM, and so ultimately are low-quality. We call the problem of aligning sampling with a grammar constraint, grammar-aligned decoding (GAD), and propose adaptive sampling with approximate expected futures (ASAp), a decoding algorithm that guarantees the output to be grammatical while provably producing outputs that match the conditional probability of the LLM's distribution conditioned on the given grammar constraint. Our algorithm uses prior sample outputs to soundly overapproximate the future grammaticality of different output prefixes. Our evaluation on code generation and structured NLP tasks shows how ASAp often produces outputs with higher likelihood (according to the LLM's distribution) than existing GCD techniques, while still enforcing the desired grammatical constraints."
Poster,GRANOLA: Adaptive Normalization for Graph Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93483,"Moshe Eliasof, Beatrice Bevilacqua, Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb, Haggai Maron","Despite the widespread adoption of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), these models often incorporate off-the-shelf normalization layers like BatchNorm or InstanceNorm, which were not originally designed for GNNs. Consequently, these normalization layers may not effectively capture the unique characteristics of graph-structured data, potentially even weakening the expressive power of the overall architecture. While existing graph-specific normalization layers have been proposed, they often struggle to offer substantial and consistent benefits. In this paper, we propose GRANOLA, a novel graph-adaptive normalization layer. Unlike existing normalization layers, GRANOLA normalizes node features by adapting to the specific characteristics of the graph, particularly by generating expressive representations of its nodes, obtained by leveraging the propagation of Random Node Features (RNF) in the graph. We provide theoretical results that support our design choices as well as an extensive empirical evaluation demonstrating the superior performance of GRANOLA over existing normalization techniques. Furthermore, GRANOLA emerges as the top-performing method among all baselines in the same time complexity class of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs)."
Poster,Graph-based Uncertainty Metrics for Long-form Language Model Generations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94679,"Mingjian Jiang, Yangjun Ruan, Prasanna Sattigeri, Salim Roukos, Tatsunori Hashimoto","Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved text generation capabilities, but these systems are still known to hallucinate, and granular uncertainty estimation for long-form LLM generations remains challenging. In this work, we propose Graph Uncertainty -- which represents the relationship between LLM generations and claims within them as a bipartite graph and estimates the claim-level uncertainty with a family of graph centrality metrics. Under this view, existing uncertainty estimation methods based on the concept of self-consistency can be viewed as using degree centrality as an uncertainty measure, and we show that more sophisticated alternatives such as closeness centrality provide consistent gains at claim-level uncertainty estimation.Moreover, we present uncertainty-aware decoding techniques that leverage both the graph structure and uncertainty estimates to improve the factuality of LLM generations by preserving only the most reliable claims. Compared to existing methods, our graph-based uncertainty metrics lead to an average of 6.8% relative gains on AUPRC across various long-form generation settings, and our end-to-end system provides consistent 2-4% gains in factuality over existing decoding techniques while significantly improving the informativeness of generated responses."
Poster,Graph-based Unsupervised Disentangled Representation Learning via Multimodal Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94595,"Baao Xie, Qiuyu Chen, Yunnan Wang, Zequn Zhang, Xin Jin, Wenjun Zeng","Disentangled representation learning (DRL) aims to identify and decompose underlying factors behind observations, thus facilitating data perception and generation. However, current DRL approaches often rely on the unrealistic assumption that semantic factors are statistically independent. In reality, these factors may exhibit correlations, which off-the-shelf solutions have yet to properly address. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a bidirectional weighted graph-based framework, to learn factorized attributes and their interrelations within complex data. Specifically, we propose a $\beta$-VAE based module to extract factors as the initial nodes of the graph, and leverage the multimodal large language model (MLLM) to discover and rank latent correlations, thereby updating the weighted edges. By integrating these complementary modules, our model successfully achieves fine-grained, practical and unsupervised disentanglement. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance in disentanglement and reconstruction. Furthermore, the model inherits enhanced interpretability and generalizability from MLLMs."
Poster,Graph Classification via Reference Distribution Learning: Theory and Practice,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96839,"Zixiao Wang, Jicong Fan","Graph classification is a challenging problem owing to the difficulty in quantifying the similarity between graphs or representing graphs as vectors, though there have been a few methods using graph kernels or graph neural networks (GNNs). Graph kernels often suffer from computational costs and manual feature engineering, while GNNs commonly utilize global pooling operations, risking the loss of structural or semantic information. This work introduces Graph Reference Distribution Learning (GRDL), an efficient and accurate graph classification method. GRDL treats each graph's latent node embeddings given by GNN layers as a discrete distribution, enabling direct classification without global pooling, based on maximum mean discrepancy to adaptively learned reference distributions. To fully understand this new model (the existing theories do not apply) and guide its configuration (e.g., network architecture, references' sizes, number, and regularization) for practical use, we derive generalization error bounds for GRDL and verify them numerically. More importantly, our theoretical and numerical results both show that GRDL has a stronger generalization ability than GNNs with global pooling operations. Experiments on moderate-scale and large-scale graph datasets show the superiority of GRDL over the state-of-the-art, emphasizing its remarkable efficiency, being at least 10 times faster than leading competitors in both training and inference stages."
Poster,Graph Coarsening with Message-Passing Guarantees,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93445,"Antonin Joly, Nicolas Keriven","Graph coarsening aims to reduce the size of a large graph while preserving some of its key properties, which has been used in many applications to reduce computational load and memory footprint. For instance, in graph machine learning, training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on coarsened graphs leads to drastic savings in time and memory. However, GNNs rely on the Message-Passing (MP) paradigm, and classical spectral preservation guarantees for graph coarsening do not directly lead to theoretical guarantees when performing naive message-passing on the coarsened graph.In this work, we propose a new message-passing operation specific to coarsened graphs, which exhibit theoretical guarantees on the preservation of the propagated signal. Interestingly, and in a sharp departure from previous proposals, this operation on coarsened graphs is oriented, even when the original graph is undirected. We conduct node classification tasks on synthetic and real data and observe improved results compared to performing naive message-passing on the coarsened graph."
Poster,Graphcode: Learning from multiparameter persistent homology using graph neural networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95396,"Florian Russold, Michael Kerber","We introduce graphcodes, a novel multi-scale summary of the topological properties of a dataset that is based on the well-established theory of persistent homology. Graphcodes handle datasets that are filtered along two real-valued scale parameters. Such multi-parameter topological summaries are usually based on complicated theoretical foundations and difficult to compute; in contrast, graphcodes yield an informative and interpretable summary and can be computed as efficient as one-parameter summaries. Moreover, a graphcode is simply an embedded graph and can therefore be readily integrated in machine learning pipelines using graph neural networks. We describe such a pipeline and demonstrate that graphcodes achieve better classification accuracy than state-of-the-art approaches on various datasets."
Poster,Graph Convolutions Enrich the Self-Attention in Transformers!,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94193,"Jeongwhan Choi, Hyowon Wi, Jayoung Kim, Yehjin Shin, Kookjin Lee, Nathaniel Trask, Noseong Park","Transformers, renowned for their self-attention mechanism, have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various tasks in natural language processing, computer vision, time-series modeling, etc. However, one of the challenges with deep Transformer models is the oversmoothing problem, where representations across layers converge to indistinguishable values, leading to significant performance degradation. We interpret the original self-attention as a simple graph filter and redesign it from a graph signal processing (GSP) perspective. We propose a graph-filter-based self-attention (GFSA) to learn a general yet effective one, whose complexity, however, is slightly larger than that of the original self-attention mechanism. We demonstrate that GFSA improves the performance of Transformers in various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, graph-level tasks, speech recognition, and code classification."
Poster,GraphCroc: Cross-Correlation Autoencoder for Graph Structural Reconstruction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92934,"Shijin Duan, Ruyi Ding, Jiaxing He, Aidong Ding, Yunsi Fei, Xiaolin Xu","Graph-structured data is integral to many applications, prompting the development of various graph representation methods. Graph autoencoders (GAEs), in particular, reconstruct graph structures from node embeddings. Current GAE models primarily utilize self-correlation to represent graph structures and focus on node-level tasks, often overlooking multi-graph scenarios. Our theoretical analysis indicates that self-correlation generally falls short in accurately representing specific graph features such as islands, symmetrical structures, and directional edges, particularly in smaller or multiple graph contexts.To address these limitations, we introduce a cross-correlation mechanism that significantly enhances the GAE representational capabilities. Additionally, we propose the GraphCroc, a new GAE that supports flexible encoder architectures tailored for various downstream tasks and ensures robust structural reconstruction, through a mirrored encoding-decoding process. This model also tackles the challenge of representation bias during optimization by implementing a loss-balancing strategy. Both theoretical analysis and numerical evaluations demonstrate that our methodology significantly outperforms existing self-correlation-based GAEs in graph structure reconstruction."
Poster,Graph Diffusion Policy Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96349,"Yijing Liu, Chao Du, Tianyu Pang, Chongxuan LI, Min Lin, Wei Chen","Recent research has made significant progress in optimizing diffusion models for downstream objectives, which is an important pursuit in fields such as graph generation for drug design. However, directly applying these models to graph presents challenges, resulting in suboptimal performance. This paper introduces graph diffusion policy optimization (GDPO), a novel approach to optimize graph diffusion models for arbitrary (e.g., non-differentiable) objectives using reinforcement learning. GDPO is based on an eager policy gradient tailored for graph diffusion models, developed through meticulous analysis and promising improved performance. Experimental results show that GDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance in various graph generation tasks with complex and diverse objectives.
