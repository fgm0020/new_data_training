Poster,Confidence Regulation Neurons in Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96903,"Alessandro Stolfo, Ben Wu, Wes Gurnee, Yonatan Belinkov, Xingyi Song, Mrinmaya Sachan, Neel Nanda","Despite their widespread use, the mechanisms by which large language models (LLMs) represent and regulate uncertainty in next-token predictions remain largely unexplored. This study investigates two critical components believed to influence this uncertainty: the recently discovered entropy neurons and a new set of components that we term token frequency neurons. Entropy neurons are characterized by an unusually high weight norm and influence the final layer normalization (LayerNorm) scale to effectively scale down the logits. Our work shows that entropy neurons operate by writing onto an \textit{unembedding null space}, allowing them to impact the residual stream norm with minimal direct effect on the logits themselves. We observe the presence of entropy neurons across a range of models, up to 7 billion parameters. On the other hand, token frequency neurons, which we discover and describe here for the first time, boost or suppress each token’s logit proportionally to its log frequency, thereby shifting the output distribution towards or away from the unigram distribution. Finally, we present a detailed case study where entropy neurons actively manage confidence: the setting of induction, i.e. detecting and continuing repeated subsequences."
Poster,Confident Natural Policy Gradient for Local Planning in  $q_\pi$-realizable Constrained MDPs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95038,"Tian Tian, Lin Yang, Csaba Szepesvari","The constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) framework emerges as an important reinforcement learning approach for imposing safety or other critical objectives while maximizing cumulative reward. However, the current understanding of how to learn efficiently in a CMDP environment with a potentially infinite number of states remains under investigation, particularly when function approximation is applied to the value functions. In this paper, we address the learning problem given linear function approximation with $q_{\pi}$-realizability, where the value functions of all policies are linearly representable with a known feature map, a setting known to be more general and challenging than other linear settings. Utilizing a local-access model, we propose a novel primal-dual algorithm that, after $\tilde{O}(\text{poly}(d) \epsilon^{-3})$ iterations, outputs with high probability a policy that strictly satisfies the constraints while nearly optimizing the value with respect to a reward function. Here, $d$ is the feature dimension and $\epsilon > 0$ is a given  error. The algorithm relies on a carefully crafted off-policy evaluation procedure to evaluate the policy using historical data, which informs policy updates through policy gradients and conserves samples. To our knowledge, this is the first result achieving polynomial sample complexity for CMDP in the $q_{\pi}$-realizable setting."
Poster,Conformal Alignment: Knowing When to Trust Foundation Models with Guarantees,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94658,"Yu Gui, Ying Jin, Zhimei Ren","Before deploying outputs from foundation models in high-stakes tasks, it is imperative to ensure that they align with human values.For instance, in radiology report generation, reports generated by a vision-language model must align with human evaluations before their use in medical decision-making. This paper presents Conformal Alignment, a general framework for identifying units whose outputs meet a user-specified alignment criterion. It is guaranteed that on average, a prescribed fraction of selected units indeed meet the alignment criterion, regardless of the foundation model or the data distribution. Given any pre-trained model and new units with model-generated outputs, Conformal Alignment leverages a set of reference data with ground-truth alignment status to train an alignment predictor. It then selects new units whose predicted alignment scores surpass a data-dependent threshold, certifying their corresponding outputs as trustworthy. Through applications to question answering and radiology report generation, we demonstrate that our method is able to accurately identify units with trustworthy outputs via lightweight training over a moderate amount of reference data. En route, we investigate the informativeness of various features in alignment prediction and combine them with standard models to construct the alignment predictor."
Poster,Conformal Classification with Equalized Coverage for Adaptively Selected Groups,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96713,"Yanfei Zhou, Matteo Sesia",This paper introduces a conformal inference method to evaluate uncertainty in classification by generating prediction sets with valid coverage conditional on adaptively chosen features. These features are carefully selected to reflect potential model limitations or biases. This can be useful to find a practical compromise between efficiency---by providing informative predictions---and algorithmic fairness---by ensuring equalized coverage for the most sensitive groups. We demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of this method on simulated and real data sets.
Poster,Conformal Inverse Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94725,"Bo Lin, Erick Delage, Timothy Chan","Inverse optimization has been increasingly used to estimate unknown parameters in an optimization model based on decision data. We show that such a point estimation is insufficient in a prescriptive setting where the estimated parameters are used to prescribe new decisions. The prescribed decisions may be low-quality and misaligned with human intuition and thus are unlikely to be adopted. To tackle this challenge, we propose conformal inverse optimization, which seeks to learn an uncertainty set for the unknown parameters and then solve a robust optimization model to prescribe new decisions. Under mild assumptions, we show that our method enjoys provable guarantees on solution quality, as evaluated using both the ground-truth parameters and the decision maker's perception of the unknown parameters. Our method demonstrates strong empirical performance compared to classic inverse optimization."
Poster,Conformalized Credal Set Predictors,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93218,"Alireza Javanmardi, David Stutz, Eyke Hüllermeier","Credal sets are sets of probability distributions that are considered as candidates for an imprecisely known ground-truth distribution. In machine learning, they have recently attracted attention as an appealing formalism for uncertainty representation, in particular, due to their ability to represent both the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a prediction. However, the design of methods for learning credal set predictors remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we make use of conformal prediction for this purpose. More specifically, we propose a method for predicting credal sets in the classification task, given training data labeled by probability distributions. Since our method inherits the coverage guarantees of conformal prediction, our conformal credal sets are guaranteed to be valid with high probability (without any assumptions on model or distribution). We demonstrate the applicability of our method on ambiguous classification tasks for uncertainty quantification."
Poster,Conformalized Multiple Testing after Data-dependent Selection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96339,"Xiaoning Wang, Yuyang Huo, Liuhua Peng, Changliang Zou","The task of distinguishing individuals of interest from a vast pool of candidates using predictive models has garnered significant attention in recent years. This task can be framed as a *conformalized multiple testing* procedure, which aims at quantifying prediction uncertainty by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) via conformal inference. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of conformalized multiple testing after data-dependent selection procedures. To guarantee the construction of valid test statistics that accurately capture the distorted distribution resulting from the selection process, we leverage a holdout labeled set to closely emulate the selective distribution. Our approach involves adaptively picking labeled data to create a calibration set based on the stability of the selection rule. This strategy ensures that the calibration data and the selected test unit are exchangeable, allowing us to develop valid conformal p-values. Implementing with the famous Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure, it effectively controls the FDR over the selected subset. To handle the randomness of the selected subset and the dependence among the constructed p-values, we establish a unified theoretical framework. This framework extends the application of conformalized multiple testing to complex selective settings. Furthermore, we conduct numerical studies to showcase the effectiveness and validity of our procedures across various scenarios."
Poster,Conformalized Time Series with Semantic Features,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95653,"Baiting Chen, Zhimei Ren, Lu Cheng","Conformal prediction is a powerful tool for uncertainty quantification, but its application to time-series data is constrained by the violation of the exchangeability assumption. Current solutions for time-series prediction typically operate in the output space and rely on manually selected weights to address distribution drift, leading to overly conservative predictions. To enable dynamic weight learning in the semantically rich latent space, we introduce a novel approach called Conformalized Time Series with Semantic Features (CT-SSF). CT-SSF utilizes the inductive bias in deep representation learning to dynamically adjust weights, prioritizing semantic features relevant to the current prediction. Theoretically, we show that CT-SSF surpasses previous methods defined in the output space. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate that CT-SSF significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) conformal prediction techniques in terms of prediction efficiency while maintaining a valid coverage guarantee."
Poster,Conformal Prediction for Class-wise Coverage via Augmented Label Rank Calibration,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95055,"Yuanjie Shi, Subhankar Ghosh, Taha Belkhouja, Jana Doppa, Yan Yan","Conformal prediction (CP) is an emerging uncertainty quantification framework that allows us to construct a prediction set to cover the true label with a pre-specified marginal or conditional probability.Although the valid coverage guarantee has been extensively studied for classification problems, CP often produces large prediction sets which may not be practically useful.This issue is exacerbated for the setting of class-conditional coverage on imbalanced classification tasks with many and/or imbalanced classes.This paper proposes the Rank Calibrated Class-conditional CP (RC3P) algorithm to reduce the prediction set sizes to achieve class-conditional coverage, where the valid coverage holds for each class.In contrast to the standard class-conditional CP (CCP) method that uniformly thresholds the class-wise conformity score for each class, the augmented label rank calibration step allows RC3P to selectively iterate this class-wise thresholding subroutine only for a subset of classes whose class-wise top-$k$ error is small.We prove that agnostic to the classifier and data distribution, RC3P achieves class-wise coverage. We also show that RC3P reduces the size of prediction sets compared to the CCP method. Comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that RC3P achieves class-wise coverage and  $26.25\\%$ $\downarrow$ reduction in prediction set sizes on average."
Poster,Confusion-Resistant Federated Learning via Diffusion-Based Data Harmonization on Non-IID Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95925,"xiaohong chen, Canran Xiao, Yongmei liu","Federated learning has become a pivotal distributed learning paradigm, involving collaborative model updates across multiple nodes with private data. However, handling non-i.i.d. (not identically and independently distributed) data and ensuring model consistency across heterogeneous environments present significant challenges. These challenges often lead to model performance degradation and increased difficulty in achieving effective communication among participant models. In this work, we propose Confusion-Resistant Federated Learning via Consistent Diffusion (CRFed), a novel framework designed to address these issues. Our approach introduces a new diffusion-based data harmonization mechanism that includes data augmentation, noise injection, and iterative denoising to ensure consistent model updates across non-i.i.d. data distributions. This mechanism aims to reduce data distribution disparities among participating nodes, enhancing the coordination and consistency of model updates. Moreover, we design a confusion-resistant strategy leveraging an indicator function and adaptive learning rate adjustment to mitigate the adverse effects of data heterogeneity and model inconsistency. Specifically, we calculate importance sampling weights based on the optimal sampling probability, which guides the selection of clients and the sampling of their data, ensuring that model updates are robust and aligned across different nodes. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and NIPD, demonstrate the effectiveness of CRFed in improving accuracy, convergence speed, and overall robustness in federated learning scenarios with severe data heterogeneity."
