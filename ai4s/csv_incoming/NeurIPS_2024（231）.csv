Poster,"Learn more, but bother less: parameter efficient continual learning",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94599,"Fuli Qiao, Mehrdad Mahdavi","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated profound capabilities due to their extensive pre-training on diverse corpora. However, LLMs often struggle with catastrophic forgetting when engaged in sequential task learning. In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient approach for continual learning in LLMs, which empirically investigates knowledge transfer from previously learned tasks to new tasks through low-rank matrix parameters, enhancing the learning of new tasks without significant interference. Our method employs sensitivity-based analysis of low-rank matrix parameters to identify knowledge-specific parameters between sequential tasks, which are used to initialize the low-rank matrix parameters in new tasks. To maintain orthogonality and minimize forgetting, we further involve the gradient projection technique that keeps the low-rank subspaces of each new task orthogonal to those of previous tasks. Our experimental results on continual learning benchmarks validate the efficacy of our proposed method, which outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in reducing forgetting, enhancing task performance, and preserving the model's ability to generalize to unseen tasks."
Poster,Learn To be Efficient: Build Structured Sparsity in Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94003,"Haizhong Zheng, Xiaoyan Bai, Xueshen Liu, Zhuoqing Morley Mao, Beidi Chen, Fan Lai, Atul Prakash","Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success with their billion-level parameters, yet they incur high inference overheads. The emergence of activation sparsity in LLMs provides a natural approach to reduce this cost by involving only parts of the parameters for inference. However, existing methods only focus on utilizing this naturally formed activation sparsity in a post-training setting, overlooking the potential for further amplifying this inherent sparsity. In this paper, we hypothesize that LLMs can learn to be efficient by achieving more structured activation sparsity. To achieve this, we introduce a novel training algorithm, Learn-To-be-Efficient (LTE), designed to train efficiency-aware LLMs to learn to activate fewer neurons and achieve a better trade-off between sparsity and performance. Furthermore, unlike SOTA MoEfication methods, which mainly focus on ReLU-based models, LTE can also be applied to LLMs like LLaMA using non-ReLU activations. Extensive evaluation on language understanding, language generation, and instruction tuning tasks show that LTE consistently outperforms SOTA baselines. Along with our hardware-aware custom kernel implementation, LTE reduces LLaMA2-7B inference latency by 25% at 50% sparsity."
Poster,Least Squares Regression Can Exhibit Under-Parameterized Double Descent,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94105,"Xinyue Li, Rishi Sonthalia","The relationship between the number of training data points, the number of parameters, and the generalization capabilities of models has been widely studied. Previous work has shown that double descent can occur in the over-parameterized regime and that the standard bias-variance trade-off holds in the under-parameterized regime. These works provide multiple reasons for the existence of the peak. We postulate that the location of the peak depends on the technical properties of both the spectrum as well as the eigenvectors of the sample covariance. We present two simple examples that provably exhibit double descent in the under-parameterized regime and do not seem to occur for reasons provided in prior work."
Poster,LeDex: Training LLMs to Better Self-Debug and Explain Code,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94367,"Nan Jiang, Xiaopeng Li, Shiqi Wang, Qiang Zhou, Soneya Hossain, Baishakhi Ray, Varun Kumar, Xiaofei Ma, Anoop Deoras","In the domain of code generation, self-debugging is crucial. It allows LLMs to refine their generated code based on execution feedback. This is particularly important because generating correct solutions in one attempt proves challenging for complex tasks. Prior works on self-debugging mostly focus on prompting methods by providing LLMs with few-shot examples, which work poorly on small open-sourced LLMs. In this work, we propose LeDex, a training framework that significantly improves the self-debugging capability of LLMs. Intuitively, we observe that a chain of explanations on the wrong code followed by code refinement helps LLMs better analyze the wrong code and do refinement. We thus propose an automated pipeline to collect a high-quality dataset for code explanation and refinement by generating a number of explanations and refinement trajectories from the LLM itself or a larger teacher model and filtering via execution verification. We perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and further reinforcement learning (RL) on both success and failure trajectories with a novel reward design considering code explanation and refinement quality. SFT improves the pass@1 by up to 15.92\% and pass@10 by 9.30\% over four benchmarks. RL training brings additional up to 3.54\% improvement on pass@1 and 2.55\% improvement on pass@10. The trained LLMs show iterative refinement ability and can keep refining code continuously. Lastly, our human evaluation shows that the LLMs trained with our framework generate more useful code explanations and help developers better understand bugs in source code."
Poster,Length Optimization in Conformal Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96056,"Shayan Kiyani, George J. Pappas, Hamed Hassani","Conditional validity and length efficiency are two crucial aspects of conformal prediction (CP). Conditional validity ensures accurate uncertainty quantification for data subpopulations, while proper length efficiency ensures that the prediction sets remain informative. Despite significant efforts to address each of these issues individually, a principled framework that reconciles these two objectives has been missing in the CP literature. In this paper, we develop Conformal Prediction with Length-Optimization (CPL) - a novel and practical framework that constructs prediction sets with (near-) optimal length while ensuring conditional validity under various classes of covariate shifts, including the key cases of marginal and group-conditional coverage. In the infinite sample regime, we provide strong duality results which indicate that CPL achieves conditional validity and length optimality. In the finite sample regime, we show that CPL constructs conditionally valid prediction sets. Our extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the superior prediction set size performance of CPL compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse real-world and synthetic datasets in classification, regression, and large language model-based multiple choice question answering.

Poster,LESS: Label-Efficient and Single-Stage Referring 3D Segmentation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94069,"Xuexun Liu, Xiaoxu Xu, Jinlong Li, Qiudan Zhang, Xu Wang, Nicu Sebe, Lin Ma","Referring 3D Segmentation is a visual-language task that segments all points of the specified object from a 3D point cloud described by a sentence of query. Previous works perform a two-stage paradigm, first conducting language-agnostic instance segmentation then matching with given text query. However, the semantic concepts from text query and visual cues are separately interacted during the training, and both instance and semantic labels for each object are required, which is time consuming and human-labor intensive. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel Referring 3D Segmentation pipeline, Label-Efficient and Single-Stage, dubbed LESS, which is only under the supervision of efficient binary mask. Specifically, we design a Point-Word Cross-Modal Alignment module for aligning the fine-grained features of points and textual embedding. Query Mask Predictor module and Query-Sentence Alignment module are introduced for coarse-grained alignment between masks and query. Furthermore, we propose an area regularization loss, which coarsely reduces irrelevant background predictions on a large scale. Besides, a point-to-point contrastive loss is proposed concentrating on distinguishing points with subtly similar features. Through extensive experiments, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on ScanRefer dataset by surpassing the previous methods about 3.7% mIoU using only binary labels.

Poster,Leveraging an ECG Beat Diffusion Model for Morphological Reconstruction from Indirect Signals,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96011,"Lisa Bedin, Gabriel Cardoso, Josselin Duchateau, Remi Dubois, Eric Moulines","Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide essential information about the heart's condition and are widely used for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. The morphology of a single heartbeat over the available leads is a primary biosignal for monitoring cardiac conditions. However, analyzing heartbeat morphology can be challenging due to noise and artifacts, missing leads, and a lack of annotated data.Generative models, such as denoising diffusion generative models (DDMs), have proven successful in generating complex data. We introduce $\texttt{BeatDiff}$, a light-weight DDM tailored for the morphology of multiple leads heartbeats.We then show that many important ECG downstream tasks can be formulated as conditional generation methods in a Bayesian inverse problem framework using $\texttt{BeatDiff}$ as priors. We propose $\texttt{EM-BeatDiff}$, an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, to solve this conditional generation tasks without fine-tuning. We illustrate our results with several tasks, such as removal of ECG noise and artifacts (baseline wander, electrode motion), reconstruction of a 12-lead ECG from a single lead (useful for ECG reconstruction of smartwatch experiments), and unsupervised explainable anomaly detection. Numerical experiments show that the combination of $\texttt{BeatDiff}$ and $\texttt{EM-BeatDiff}$ outperforms SOTA methods for the problems considered in this work."
Poster,Leveraging Catastrophic Forgetting to Develop Safe Diffusion Models against Malicious Finetuning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93554,"Jiadong Pan, Hongcheng Gao, Zongyu Wu, Taihang Hu, Li Su, Qingming Huang, Liang Li","Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in producing images based on textual prompts. Numerous methods have been proposed to ensure these models generate safe images. Early methods attempt to incorporate safety filters into models to mitigate the risk of generating harmful images but such external filters do not inherently detoxify the model and can be easily bypassed. Hence, model unlearning and data cleaning are the most essential methods for maintaining the safety of models, given their impact on model parameters.However, malicious fine-tuning can still make models prone to generating harmful or undesirable images even with these methods.Inspired by the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting, we propose a training policy using contrastive learning to increase the latent space distance between clean and harmful data distribution, thereby protecting models from being fine-tuned to generate harmful images due to forgetting.The experimental results demonstrate that our methods not only maintain clean image generation capabilities before malicious fine-tuning but also effectively prevent DMs from producing harmful images after malicious fine-tuning. Our method can also be combined with other safety methods to maintain their safety against malicious fine-tuning further."
Poster,Leveraging Contrastive Learning for Enhanced Node Representations in Tokenized Graph Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93294,"Jinsong Chen, Hanpeng Liu, John Hopcroft, Kun He","While tokenized graph Transformers have demonstrated strong performance in node classification tasks, their reliance on a limited subset of nodes with high similarity scores for constructing token sequences overlooks valuable information from other nodes, hindering their ability to fully harness graph information for learning optimal node representations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel graph Transformer called GCFormer. Unlike previous approaches, GCFormer develops a hybrid token generator to create two types of token sequences, positive and negative, to capture diverse graph information. And a tailored Transformer-based backbone is adopted to learn meaningful node representations from these generated token sequences. Additionally, GCFormer introduces contrastive learning to extract valuable information from both positive and negative token sequences, enhancing the quality of learned node representations. Extensive experimental results across various datasets, including homophily and heterophily graphs, demonstrate the superiority of GCFormer in node classification, when compared to representative graph neural networks (GNNs) and graph Transformers."
Poster,Leveraging Drift to Improve Sample Complexity of Variance Exploding Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94238,"Ruofeng Yang, Zhijie Wang, Bo Jiang, Shuai Li","Variance exploding (VE) based diffusion models, an important class of diffusion models, have shown state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. However, only a few theoretical works analyze VE-based models, and those works suffer from a worse forward convergence rate $1/\text{poly}(T)$ than the $\exp{(-T)}$ of variance preserving (VP) based models, where $T$ is the forward diffusion time and the rate measures the distance between forward marginal distribution $q_T$ and pure Gaussian noise. The slow rate is due to the Brownian Motion without a drift term. In this work, we design a new drifted VESDE forward process, which allows a faster $\exp{(-T)}$ forward convergence rate. With this process, we achieve the first efficient polynomial sample complexity for a series of VE-based models with reverse SDE under the manifold hypothesis. Furthermore, unlike previous works, we allow the diffusion coefficient to be unbounded instead of a constant, which is closer to the SOTA models. Besides the reverse SDE, the other common reverse process is the probability flow ODE  (PFODE) process, which is deterministic and enjoys faster sample speed. To deepen the understanding of VE-based models, we consider a more general setting considering reverse SDE and PFODE simultaneously, propose a unified tangent-based analysis framework, and prove the first quantitative convergence guarantee for SOTA VE-based models with reverse PFODE.We also show that the drifted VESDE can balance different error terms and improve generated samples without training through synthetic and real-world experiments."
