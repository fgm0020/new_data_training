Poster,On the cohesion and separability of average-link for hierarchical agglomerative clustering,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96821,"Eduardo Laber, Miguel Batista","Average-link is widely recognized as one of the most popular and effective methods for building hierarchical agglomerative clustering. The available theoretical analyses show that this method has a much better approximation than other popular heuristics, as single-linkage and complete-linkage, regarding variants of Dasgupta's cost function [STOC 2016]. However, these analyses do not separate average-link from a random hierarchy and they are not appealing for metric spaces since every hierarchical clustering has a $1/2$  approximation with regard to the variant of Dasgupta's functionthat is employed for dissimilarity measures [Moseley and Yang 2020]. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the performance of \avglink \, in metric spaces, regarding several natural criteria that capture separability and cohesion, and are more interpretable than Dasgupta's cost function and its variants.  We also present experimental results with real datasets that, together with our theoretical analyses, suggest that average-link is a better choice than other related methods when both cohesion and separability are important goals."
Poster,On the Comparison between Multi-modal and Single-modal Contrastive Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95395,"Wei Huang, Andi Han, Yongqiang Chen, Yuan Cao, Zhiqiang Xu, Taiji Suzuki","Multi-modal contrastive learning with language supervision has presented a paradigm shift in modern machine learning. By pre-training on a web-scale dataset, multi-modal contrastive learning can learn high-quality representations that exhibit impressive robustness and transferability. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding is still in its infancy, especially regarding its comparison with single-modal contrastive learning. In this work, we introduce a feature learning theory framework that provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the differences between multi-modal and single-modal contrastive learning. Based on a data generation model consisting of signal and noise, our analysis is performed on a ReLU network trained with the InfoMax objective function. Through a trajectory-based optimization analysis and generalization characterization on downstream tasks, we identify the critical factor, which is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), that impacts the generalizability in downstream tasks of both multi-modal and single-modal contrastive learning. Through the cooperation between the two modalities, multi-modal learning can achieve better feature learning, leading to improvements in performance in downstream tasks compared to single-modal learning. Our analysis provides a unified framework that can characterize the optimization and generalization of both single-modal and multi-modal contrastive learning. Empirical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets further consolidate our theoretical findings."
Poster,On the Complexity of Identification in Linear Structural Causal Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94488,"Julian Dörfler, Benito van der Zander, Markus Bläser, Maciej Liskiewicz","Learning the unknown causal parameters of a linear structural causal model is a fundamental task in causal analysis. The task, known as the problem of identification, asks to estimate the parameters of the model from acombination of assumptions on the graphical structure of the model and observational data, represented as a non-causal covariance matrix.In this paper, we give a new sound and complete algorithm for generic identification which runs in polynomial space. By a standard simulation result, namely $\mathsf{PSPACE} \subseteq \mathsf{EXP}$,this algorithm has exponential running time which vastly improves the state-of-the-art double exponential time method using a Gröbner basis approach. The paper also presents evidence that parameter identification is computationally hard in general. In particular, we prove, that the taskasking whether, for a given feasible correlation matrix, there are exactly one or two or more parameter sets explaining the observed matrix, is hard for $\forall \mathbb{R}$, the co-class of the existential theory of the reals. In particular, this problem is $\mathsf{coNP}$-hard.To our best knowledge, this is the first hardness result for some notion of identifiability."
Poster,On the Complexity of Learning Sparse Functions with Statistical and Gradient Queries,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95269,"Nirmit Joshi, Theodor Misiakiewicz, Nati Srebro","The goal of this paper is to investigate the complexity of gradient algorithms when learning sparse functions (juntas). We introduce a type of Statistical Queries ($\mathsf{SQ}$), which we call Differentiable Learning Queries ($\mathsf{DLQ}$), to model gradient queries on a specified loss with respect to an arbitrary model. We provide a tight characterization of the query complexity of $\mathsf{DLQ}$ for learning the support of a sparse function over generic product distributions. This complexity crucially depends on the loss function. For the squared loss, $\mathsf{DLQ}$ matches the complexity of Correlation Statistical Queries $(\mathsf{CSQ})$—potentially much worse than $\mathsf{SQ}$. But for other simple loss functions, including the $\ell_1$ loss, $\mathsf{DLQ}$ always achieves the same complexity as $\mathsf{SQ}$. We also provide evidence that $\mathsf{DLQ}$ can indeed capture learning with (stochastic) gradient descent by showing it correctly describes the complexity of learning with a two-layer neural network in the mean field regime and linear scaling."
Poster,On the Complexity of Teaching a Family of Linear Behavior Cloning Learners,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96669,"Shubham Bharti, Stephen Wright, Adish Singla, Jerry Zhu","We study optimal teaching for a family of Behavior Cloning learners that learn using a linear hypothesis class. In this setup, a knowledgeable teacher can demonstrate a dataset of state and action tuples and is required to teach an optimal policy to an entire family of BC learners using the smallest possible dataset. We analyze the linear family and design a novel teaching algorithm called `TIE' that achieves the instance optimal Teaching Dimension for the entire family. However, we show that this problem is NP-hard for action spaces with $|\mathcal{A}| > 2$ and provide an efficient approximation algorithm with a $\log(|\mathcal{A}| - 1)$ guarantee on the optimal teaching size. We present empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm and compare it to various baselines in different teaching environments."
Poster,On the Computational Complexity of Private High-dimensional Model Selection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95270,"Saptarshi Roy, Zehua Wang, Ambuj Tewari","We consider the problem of model selection in a high-dimensional sparse linear regression model under privacy constraints. We propose a differentially private (DP) best subset selection method with strong statistical utility properties by adopting the well-known exponential mechanism for selecting the best model. To achieve computational expediency, we propose an efficient Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and under certain regularity conditions, we establish that it enjoys polynomial mixing time to its stationary distribution. As a result, we also establish both approximate differential privacy and statistical utility for the estimates of the mixed Metropolis-Hastings chain. Finally, we perform some illustrative experiments on simulated data showing that our algorithm can quickly identify active features under reasonable privacy budget constraints."
Poster,On the Computational Landscape of Replicable Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96867,"Alkis Kalavasis, Amin Karbasi, Grigoris Velegkas, Felix Zhou","We study computational aspects of algorithmic replicability, a notion of stability introduced by Impagliazzo, Lei,Pitassi, and Sorrell [STOC, 2022]. Motivated by a recent line of work that established strong statistical connections betweenreplicability and other notions of learnability such as online learning, private learning, and SQ learning, we aim tounderstand better the computational connections between replicability and these learning paradigms.Our first result shows that there is a concept class that is efficiently replicably PAC learnable, but, under standardcryptographic assumptions, no efficient online learner exists for this class. Subsequently, we design an efficientreplicable learner for PAC learning parities when the marginal distribution is far from uniform, making progress on aquestion posed by Impagliazzo et al. [STOC, 2022]. To obtain this result, we design a replicable lifting framework inspired byBlanc, Lange, Malik, and Tan [STOC, 2023], that transforms in a black-box manner efficient replicable PAC learners under theuniform marginal distribution over the Boolean hypercube to replicable PAC learners under any marginal distribution,with sample and time complexity that depends on a certain measure of the complexity of the distribution. Finally, we show that any pure DP learner can be transformed in a black-box manner to a replicable learner, with time complexity polynomial in the confidence and accuracy parameters, but exponential in the representation dimension of the underlying hypothesis class."
Poster,On the Convergence of Loss and Uncertainty-based Active Learning Algorithms,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95912,"Daniel Haimovich, Dima Karamshuk, Fridolin Linder, Niek Tax, Milan Vojnovic","We investigate the convergence rates and data sample sizes required for training a machine learning model using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, where data points are sampled based on either their loss value or uncertainty value. These training methods are particularly relevant for active learning and data subset selection problems. For SGD with a constant step size update, we present convergence results for linear classifiers and linearly separable datasets using squared hinge loss and similar training loss functions. Additionally, we extend our analysis to more general classifiers and datasets, considering a wide range of loss-based sampling strategies and smooth convex training loss functions. We propose a novel algorithm called Adaptive-Weight Sampling (AWS) that utilizes SGD with an adaptive step size that achieves stochastic Polyak's step size in expectation. We establish convergence rate results for AWS for smooth convex training loss functions. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of AWS on various datasets by using either exact or estimated loss values."
Poster,On the Curses of Future and History in Future-dependent Value Functions for Off-policy Evaluation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93403,"Yuheng Zhang, Nan Jiang","We study off-policy evaluation (OPE) in partially observable environments with complex observations, with the goal of developing estimators whose guarantee avoids exponential dependence on the horizon. While such estimators exist for MDPs and POMDPs can be converted to history-based MDPs, their estimation errors depend on the state-density ratio for MDPs which becomes history ratios after  conversion, an exponential object. Recently, Uehara et al. [2022a] proposed future-dependent value functions as a promising framework to address this issue, where the guarantee for memoryless policies depends on the density ratio over the latent state space. However, it also depends on the boundedness of the future-dependent value function and other related quantities, which we show could be exponential-in-length and thus erasing the advantage of the method. In this paper, we discover novel coverage assumptions tailored to the structure of POMDPs, such as outcome coverage and belief coverage, which enable polynomial bounds on the aforementioned quantities. As a side product, our analyses also lead to the discovery of new algorithms with complementary properties."
Poster,On the Effects of Data Scale on UI Control Agents,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97433,"Wei Li, William Bishop, Alice Li, Christopher Rawles, Folawiyo Campbell-Ajala, Divya Tyamagundlu, Oriana Riva","Autonomous agents that control user interfaces to accomplish human tasks are emerging. Leveraging LLMs to power such agents has been of special interest, but unless fine-tuned on human-collected task demonstrations, performance is still relatively low. In this work we study whether fine-tuning alone is a viable approach for building real-world UI control agents. To this end we collect and release a new dataset, AndroidControl, consisting of 15,283 demonstrations of everyday tasks with Android apps. Compared to existing datasets, each AndroidControl task instance includes both high and low-level human-generated instructions, allowing us to explore the level of task complexity an agent can handle. Moreover, AndroidControl is the most diverse computer control dataset to date, including 14,548 unique tasks over 833 Android apps, thus allowing us to conduct in-depth analysis of the model performance in and out of the domain of the training data. Using the dataset, we find that when tested in domain fine-tuned models outperform zero and few-shot baselines and scale in such a way that robust performance might feasibly be obtained simply by collecting more data.  Out of domain, performance scales significantly more slowly and suggests that in particular for high-level tasks, fine-tuning on more data alone may be insufficient for achieving robust out-of-domain performance."
