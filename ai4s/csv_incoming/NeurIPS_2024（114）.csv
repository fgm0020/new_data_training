Poster,Diversity Is Not All You Need: Training A Robust Cooperative Agent Needs Specialist Partners,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96888,"Rujikorn Charakorn, Poramate Manoonpong, Nat Dilokthanakul","Partner diversity is known to be crucial for training a robust generalist cooperative agent. In this paper, we show that partner specialization, in addition to diversity, is crucial for the robustness of a downstream generalist agent. We propose a principled method for quantifying both the diversity and specialization of a partner population based on the concept of mutual information. Then, we observe that the recently proposed cross-play minimization (XP-min) technique produces diverse and specialized partners. However, the generated partners are overfit, reducing their usefulness as training partners. To address this, we propose simple methods, based on reinforcement learning and supervised learning, for extracting the diverse and specialized behaviors of XP-min generated partners but not their overfitness. We demonstrate empirically that the proposed method effectively removes overfitness, and extracted populations produce more robust generalist agents compared to the source XP-min populations."
Poster,Divide-and-Conquer Meets Consensus: Unleashing the Power of Functions in Code Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94430,"Jingchang Chen, Hongxuan Tang, Zheng Chu, Qianglong Chen, Zekun Wang, Ming Liu, Bing Qin","Despite recent progress made by large language models in code generation, they still struggle with programs that meet complex requirements. Recent work utilizes plan-and-solve decomposition to decrease the complexity and leverage self-tests to refine the generated program. Yet, planning deep-inside requirements in advance can be challenging, and the tests need to be accurate to accomplish self-improvement. To this end, we propose FunCoder, a code generation framework incorporating the divide-and-conquer strategy with functional consensus. Specifically, FunCoder recursively branches off sub-functions as smaller goals during code generation, represented by a tree hierarchy. These sub-functions are then composited to attain more complex objectives. Additionally, we designate functions via a consensus formed by identifying similarities in program behavior, mitigating error propagation. FunCoder outperforms state-of-the-art methods by +9.8% on average in HumanEval, MBPP, xCodeEval and MATH with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Moreover, our method demonstrates superiority on smaller models: With FunCoder, StableCode-3b surpasses GPT-3.5 by +18.6% and achieves 97.7% of GPT-4's performance on HumanEval. Further analysis reveals that our proposed dynamic function decomposition is capable of handling complex requirements, and the functional consensus prevails over self-testing in correctness evaluation."
Poster,Divide-and-Conquer Posterior Sampling for Denoising Diffusion priors,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96195,"Yazid Janati, Badr MOUFAD, Alain Durmus, Eric Moulines, Jimmy Olsson","Recent advancements in solving Bayesian inverse problems have spotlighted denoising diffusion models (DDMs) as effective priors.Although these have great potential, DDM priors yield complex posterior distributions that are challenging to sample from.Existing approaches to posterior sampling in this context address this problem either by retraining model-specific components, leading to stiff and cumbersome methods, or by introducing approximations with uncontrolled errors that affect the accuracy of the produced samples.We present an innovative framework, divide-and-conquer posterior sampling, which leverages the inherent structure of DDMs to construct a sequence of intermediate posteriors that guide the produced samples to the target posterior.Our method significantly reduces the approximation error associated with current techniques without the need for retraining.We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our approach for a wide range of Bayesian inverse problems.The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Badr-MOUFAD/dcps}"
Poster,Divide-and-Conquer Predictive Coding: a structured Bayesian inference algorithm,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94307,"Eli Sennesh, Hao Wu, Tommaso Salvatori","Unexpected stimuli induce ""error"" or ""surprise"" signals in the brain. The theory of predictive coding promises to explain these observations in terms of Bayesian inference by suggesting that the cortex implements variational inference in a probabilistic graphical model. However, when applied to machine learning tasks, this family of algorithms has yet to perform on par with other variational approaches in high-dimensional, structured inference problems. To address this, we introduce a novel predictive coding algorithm for structured generative models, that we call divide-and-conquer predictive coding (DCPC); it differs from other formulations of predictive coding, as it respects the correlation structure of the generative model and provably performs maximum-likelihood updates of model parameters, all without sacrificing biological plausibility. Empirically, DCPC achieves better numerical performance than competing algorithms and provides accurate inference in a number of problems not previously addressed with predictive coding. We provide an open implementation of DCPC in Pyro on Github."
Poster,D-LLM: A Token Adaptive Computing Resource Allocation Strategy for Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94977,"Yikun Jiang, Huanyu Wang, Lei Xie, Hanbin Zhao, zhang chao, Hui Qian, John C. S. Lui","Large language models have shown an impressive societal impact owing to their excellent understanding and logical reasoning skills. However, such strong ability relies on a huge amount of computing resources, which makes it difficult to deploy LLMs on computing resource-constrained platforms. Currently, LLMs process each token equivalently, but we argue that not every word is equally important. Some words should not be allocated excessive computing resources, particularly for dispensable terms in simple questions. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic inference paradigm for LLMs, namely D-LLMs, which adaptively allocate computing resources in token processing. We design a dynamic decision module for each transformer layer that decides whether a network unit should be executed or skipped. Moreover, we tackle the issue of adapting D-LLMs to real-world applications, specifically concerning the missing KV-cache when layers are skipped. To overcome this, we propose a simple yet effective eviction policy to exclude the skipped layers from subsequent attention calculations. The eviction policy not only enables D-LLMs to be compatible with prevalent applications but also reduces considerable storage resources. Experimentally, D-LLMs show superior performance, in terms of computational cost and KV storage utilization. It can reduce up to 45\% computational cost and KV storage on Q\&A, summarization, and math solving tasks, 50\% on commonsense reasoning tasks."
Poster,DMC-VB: A Benchmark for Representation Learning for Control with Visual Distractors,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97877,"Joseph Ortiz, Antoine Dedieu, Wolfgang Lehrach, J Swaroop Guntupalli, Carter Wendelken, Ahmad Humayun, Sivaramakrishnan Swaminathan, Guangyao Zhou, Miguel Lazaro-Gredilla, Kevin Murphy","Learning from previously collected data via behavioral cloning or offline reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful recipe for scaling generalist agents by avoiding the need for expensive online learning. Despite strong generalization in some respects, agents are often remarkably brittle to minor visual variations in control-irrelevant factors such as the background or camera viewpoint.  In this paper, we present theDeepMind Control Visual Benchmark (DMC-VB), a dataset collected in the DeepMind Control Suite to evaluate the robustness of offline RL agents for solving continuous control tasks from visual input in the presence of visual distractors. In contrast to prior works, our dataset (a) combines locomotion and navigation tasks of varying difficulties, (b) includes static and dynamic visual variations, (c) considers data generated by policies with different skill levels, (d) systematically returns pairs of state and pixel observation, (e) is an order of magnitude larger, and (f) includes tasks with hidden goals. Accompanying our dataset, we propose three benchmarks to evaluate representation learning methods for pretraining, and carry out experiments on several recently proposed methods. First, we find that pretrained representations do not help policy learning on DMC-VB, and we highlight a large representation gap between policies learned on pixel observations and on states. Second, we demonstrate when expert data is limited, policy learning can benefit from representations pretrained on (a) suboptimal data, and (b) tasks with stochastic hidden goals. Our dataset and benchmark code to train and evaluate agents are available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/dmc_vision_benchmark."
Poster,DMesh: A Differentiable Mesh Representation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95753,"Sanghyun Son, Matheus Gadelha, Yang Zhou, Zexiang Xu, Ming Lin, Yi Zhou","We present a differentiable representation, DMesh, for general 3D triangular meshes. DMesh considers both the geometry and connectivity information of a mesh. In our design, we first get a set of convex tetrahedra that compactly tessellates the domain based on Weighted Delaunay Triangulation (WDT), and select triangular faces on the tetrahedra to define the final mesh. We formulate probability of faces to exist on the actual surface in a differentiable manner based on the WDT. This enables DMesh to represent meshes of various topology in a differentiable way, and allows us to reconstruct the mesh under various observations, such as point clouds and multi-view images using gradient-based optimization. We publicize the source code and supplementary material at our project page (https://sonsang.github.io/dmesh-project)."
Poster,D-MiSo: Editing Dynamic 3D Scenes using Multi-Gaussians Soup,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96714,"Joanna Waczynska, Piotr Borycki, Joanna Kaleta, Slawomir Tadeja, Przemysław Spurek","Over the past years, we have observed an abundance of approaches for modeling dynamic 3D scenes using Gaussian Splatting (GS). These solutions use GS to represent the scene's structure and the neural network to model dynamics. Such approaches allow fast rendering and extracting each element of such a dynamic scene. However, modifying such objects over time is challenging. SC-GS (Sparse Controlled Gaussian Splatting) enhanced with Deformed Control Points partially solves this issue. However, this approach necessitates selecting elements that need to be kept fixed, as well as centroids that should be adjusted throughout editing. Moreover, this task poses additional difficulties regarding the re-productivity of such editing. To address this, we propose Dynamic Multi-Gaussian Soup (D-MiSo), which allows us to model the mesh-inspired representation of dynamic GS. Additionally, we propose a strategy of linking parameterized Gaussian splats, forming a Triangle Soup with the estimated mesh. Consequently, we can separately construct new trajectories for the 3D objects composing the scene. Thus, we can make the scene's dynamic editable over time or while maintaining partial dynamics."
Poster,DMNet: Self-comparison Driven Model for Subject-independent Seizure Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93731,"Shihao Tu, Linfeng Cao, Daoze Zhang, Junru Chen, Lvbin Ma, Yin Zhang, YANG YANG","Automated seizure detection (ASD) using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) is critical for effective epilepsy treatment. However, the significant domain shift of iEEG signals across subjects poses a major challenge, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical scenarios. In this paper, we address this issue by analyzing the primary cause behind the failure of existing iEEG models for subject-independent seizure detection, and identify a critical universal seizure pattern: seizure events consistently exhibit higher average amplitude compared to adjacent normal events. To mitigate the domain shifts and preserve the universal seizure patterns, we propose a novel self-comparison mechanism. This mechanism effectively aligns iEEG signals across subjects and time intervals. Building upon these findings, we propose Difference Matrix-based Neural Network (DMNet), a subject-independent seizure detection model, which leverages self-comparison based on two constructed (contextual, channel-level) references to mitigate shifts of iEEG, and utilize a simple yet effective difference matrix to encode the universal seizure patterns. Extensive experiments show that DMNet significantly outperforms previous SOTAs while maintaining high efficiency on a real-world clinical dataset collected by us and two public datasets for subject-independent seizure detection. Moreover, the visualization results demonstrate that the generated difference matrix can effectively capture the seizure activity changes during the seizure evolution process. Additionally, we deploy our method in an online diagnosis system to illustrate its effectiveness in real clinical applications."
Poster,DMPlug: A Plug-in Method for Solving Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96403,"Hengkang Wang, Xu Zhang, Taihui Li, Yuxiang Wan, Tiancong Chen, Ju Sun","Pretrained diffusion models (DMs) have recently been popularly used in solving inverse problems (IPs). The existing methods mostly interleave iterative steps in the reverse diffusion process and iterative steps to bring the iterates closer to satisfying the measurement constraint. However, such interleaving methods struggle to produce final results that look like natural objects of interest (i.e., manifold feasibility) and fit the measurement (i.e., measurement feasibility), especially for nonlinear IPs. Moreover, their capabilities to deal with noisy IPs with unknown types and levels of measurement noise are unknown. In this paper, we advocate viewing the reverse process in DMs as a function and propose a novel plug-in method for solving IPs using pretrained DMs, dubbed DMPlug. DMPlug addresses the issues of manifold feasibility and measurement feasibility in a principled manner, and also shows great potential for being robust to unknown types and levels of noise. Through extensive experiments across various IP tasks, including two linear and three nonlinear IPs, we demonstrate that DMPlug consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, often by large margins especially for nonlinear IPs."
