Poster,Physics Aware Neural Networks for Unsupervised Binding Energy Prediction,https://ICML.cc//virtual/2025/poster/44857,"Ke Liu, Hao Chen, Chunhua Shen","Developing models for protein-ligand interactions holds substantial significance for drug discovery. Supervised methods often failed due to the lack of labeled data for predicting the protein-ligand binding energy, like antibodies. Therefore, unsupervised approaches are urged to make full use of the unlabeled data. To tackle the problem, we propose an efficient, unsupervised protein-ligand binding energy prediction model via the conservation of energy (CEBind), which follows the physical laws. Specifically, given a protein-ligand complex, we randomly sample forces for each atom in the ligand. Then these forces are applied rigidly to the ligand to perturb its position, following the law of rigid body dynamics. Finally, CEBind predicts the energy of both the unperturbed complex and the perturbed complex. The energy gap between two complexes equals the work of the outer forces, following the law of conservation of energy. Extensive experiments are conducted on the unsupervised protein-ligand binding energy prediction benchmarks, comparing them with previous works. Empirical results and theoretic analysis demonstrate that CEBind is more efficient and outperforms previous unsupervised models on benchmarks.",(1) Protein-ligand binding affinity prediction is significant for drug discovery.

Poster,Physics-Informed DeepONets for drift-diffusion on metric graphs: simulation and parameter identification,https://ICML.cc//virtual/2025/poster/44070,"Jan Blechschmidt, Tom-Christian Riemer, Max Winkler, Martin STOLL, Jan-Frederik Pietschmann","We develop a novel physics informed deep learning approach for solving nonlinear drift-diffusion equations on metric graphs. These models represent an important model class with a large number of applications in areas ranging from transport in biological cells to the motion of human crowds. While traditional numerical schemes require a large amount of tailoring, especially in the case of model design or parameter identification problems, physics informed deep operator networks (DeepONets) have emerged as a versatile tool for the solution of partial differential equations with the particular advantage that they easily incorporate parameter identification questions. We here present an approach where we first learn three DeepONet models for representative inflow, inner and outflow edges, resp., and then subsequently couple these models for the solution of the drift-diffusion metric graph problem by relying on an edge-based domain decomposition approach. We illustrate that our framework is applicable for the accurate evaluation of graph-coupled physics models and is well suited for solving optimization or inverse problems on these coupled networks.","The simulation of flows in networks is a challenging task. We have developed a new AI-based method to help solve such complex physical models that describe how objects like particles or people move through connected pathways—similar to networks or graphs. These models are useful in many real-world situations, such as understanding how substances move within cells or how people flow through crowded areas. Our approach uses a modern form of machine learning called physics-informed deep operator networks (DeepONets). We trained separate AI models for different parts of the network (such as where things enter, move through, or exit). Then, we connected these models together in a way that respects the structure of the whole network. Our results show that this method can accurately simulate these types of systems and can also be used to solve related challenges, like optimizing the system or identifying unknown parameters."
Poster,Physics-Informed Generative Modeling of Wireless Channels,https://ICML.cc//virtual/2025/poster/45899,"Benedikt Böck, Andreas Oeldemann, Timo Mayer, Francesco Rossetto, Wolfgang Utschick","Learning the site-specific distribution of the wireless channel within a particular environment of interest is essential to exploit the full potential of machine learning (ML) for wireless communications and radar applications. Generative modeling offers a promising framework to address this problem. However, existing approaches pose unresolved challenges, including the need for high-quality training data, limited generalizability, and a lack of physical interpretability. To address these issues, we combine the physics-related compressibility of wireless channels with generative modeling, in particular, sparse Bayesian generative modeling (SBGM), to learn the distribution of the underlying physical channel parameters. By leveraging the sparsity-inducing characteristics of SBGM, our methods can learn from compressed observations received by an access point (AP) during default online operation. Moreover, they are physically interpretable and generalize over system configurations without requiring retraining.","Learning the environment-specific statistical properties of how electromagnetic signals get manipulated when transmitting them over the air is essential to exploit the full potential of Machine Learning in wireless communications. To do so, we introduce an AI-based model that can learn these properties from corrupted data while simultaneously incorporating the underlying pre-known laws of physics. This circumvents the need for high-quality measurement campaigns to yield training samples in every environment of interest and simultaneously allows our method to dynamically adapt to the system's operation mode without requiring additional training."
Poster,Physics-informed Temporal Alignment for Auto-regressive PDE Foundation Models,https://ICML.cc//virtual/2025/poster/45452,"Congcong Zhu, Xiaoyan Xu, Jiayue Han, Jingrun Chen","Auto-regressive partial differential equation (PDE) foundation models have shown great potential in handling time-dependent data. However, these models suffer from error accumulation caused by the shortcut problem deeply rooted in auto-regressive prediction. The challenge becomes particularly evident for out-of-distribution data, as the pretraining performance may approach random model initialization for downstream tasks with long-term dynamics. To deal with this problem, we propose physics-informed temporal alignment (PITA), a self-supervised learning framework inspired by inverse problem solving. Specifically, PITA aligns the physical dynamics discovered at different time steps on each given PDE trajectory by integrating physics-informed constraints into the self-supervision signal. The alignment is derived from observation data without relying on known physics priors, indicating strong generalization ability to out-of-distribution data. Extensive experiments show that PITA significantly enhances the accuracy and robustness of existing foundation models on diverse time-dependent PDE data. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/SCAILab-USTC/PITA}.","Many deep learning models that predict the evolution of physical systems step by step suffer from accumulating errors over long-term forecasts. To address this, we propose physics-informed temporal alignment (PITA), a self-supervised learning framework inspired by inverse problem solving. Rather than relying on predefined physical equations, PITA automatically uncovers the underlying dynamics from observed trajectory data and uses these learned dynamics to align and correct predictions across successive time steps. By referencing the discovered physical patterns at each prediction stage, the model self-corrects and substantially mitigates error accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PITA significantly improves both the accuracy and robustness of existing auto-regressive PDE foundation models, even when applied to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Poster,Physics-Informed Weakly Supervised Learning For Interatomic Potentials,https://ICML.cc//virtual/2025/poster/44619,"Makoto Takamoto, Viktor Zaverkin, Mathias Niepert","Machine learning is playing an increasingly important role in computational chemistry and materials science, complementing expensive ab initio and first-principles methods. However, machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often struggle with generalization and robustness, leading to unphysical energy and force predictions in atomistic simulations. To address this, we propose a physics-informed, weakly supervised training framework for MLIPs. Our method introduces two novel loss functions: one based on Taylor expansions of the potential energy and another enforcing conservative force constraints. This approach enhances accuracy, particularly in low-data regimes, and reduces the reliance on large, expensive training datasets. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets show up to 2× reductions in energy and force errors for multiple baseline models. Additionally, our method improves the stability of molecular dynamics simulations and facilitates effective fine-tuning of ML foundation models on sparse, high-accuracy ab initio data. An implementation of our method and scripts for executing experiments are available at \url{https://github.com/nec-research/PICPS-ML4Sci}.","$\textbf{Problem setup.}$Machine learning is increasingly used to speed up simulations in chemistry and materials science, which are often too slow or expensive when using traditional physics-based methods. However, many machine learning models used in this field—called interatomic potentials—can behave unpredictably, especially when they encounter new or limited data. This leads to unrealistic predictions of energy and forces between atoms.$\textbf{Our approach.}$We developed a new training method that teaches machine learning models to better respect the underlying physics of atomic systems. Instead of relying only on large datasets, we added two key components: one that helps the model learn how energy behaves near atoms using Taylor expansions, and another that ensures the predicted forces follow the laws of physics. These additions allow the models to learn more accurately even from small amounts of data.$\textbf{Our contribution and importance.}$Our method makes machine learning models more reliable and efficient for simulating materials and molecules. It cuts prediction errors in half for several widely used models and makes long-term simulations more stable. This means researchers can now use smaller, high-quality datasets to train models that are both accurate and physically meaningful—making advanced materials discovery and chemical simulations faster and more accessible."
Poster,PhySpec: Physically Consistent Spectral Reconstruction via Orthogonal Subspace Decomposition and Self-Supervised Meta-Auxiliary Learning,https://ICML.cc//virtual/2025/poster/45023,"Xingxing Yang, Jie Chen, Zaifeng Yang","This paper presents a novel approach to hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction from RGB images, addressing fundamental limitations in existing learning-based methods from a physical perspective. We discuss and aim to address the ``colorimetric dilemma"": failure to consistently reproduce ground-truth RGB from predicted HSI, thereby compromising physical integrity and reliability in practical applications. To tackle this issue, we propose PhySpec, a physically consistent framework for robust HSI reconstruction. Our approach fundamentally exploits the intrinsic physical relationship between HSIs and corresponding RGBs by employing orthogonal subspace decomposition, which enables explicit estimation of camera spectral sensitivity (CSS). This ensures that our reconstructed spectra align with well-established physical principles, enhancing their reliability and fidelity. Moreover, to efficiently use internal information from test samples, we propose a self-supervised meta-auxiliary learning (MAXL) strategy that rapidly adapts the trained parameters to unseen samples using only a few gradient descent steps at test time, while simultaneously constraining the generated HSIs to accurately recover ground-truth RGB values. Thus, MAXL reinforces the physical integrity of the reconstruction process. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations validate the efficacy of our proposed framework, showing superior performance compared to SOTA methods.","Problem:Hyperspectral cameras capture rich light data but are costly. Converting standard RGB images to hyperspectral (HSI) via AI often fails to reproduce original colors accurately, creating unreliable results.Solution:We built PhySpec, an AI framework that combines physics principles and self-learning. It estimates camera color sensitivity and lighting effects to ensure HSI reconstructions match real-world physics. A novel self-training step (MAXL) fine-tunes the model for each new image using just a few adjustments, enforcing color accuracy.Impact:PhySpec produces more trustworthy hyperspectral data, crucial for medical imaging, environmental monitoring, and beyond. By grounding AI in physical rules, it advances reliable spectral analysis without expensive hardware."
Poster,PiD: Generalized AI-Generated Images Detection with Pixelwise Decomposition Residuals,https://ICML.cc//virtual/2025/poster/44442,"Xinghe Fu, Zhiyuan Yan, Zheng Yang, Taiping Yao, Yandan Zhao, Shouhong Ding, Xi Li","Fake images, created by recently advanced generative models, have become increasingly indistinguishable from real ones, making their detection crucial, urgent, and challenging. This paper introduces PiD (Pixelwise Decomposition Residuals), a novel detection method that focuses on residual signals within images. Generative models are designed to optimize high-level semantic content (principal components), often overlooking low-level signals (residual components). PiD leverages this observation by disentangling residual components from images, encouraging the model to uncover more underlying and general forgery clues independent of semantic content. Compared to prior approaches that rely on reconstruction techniques or high-frequency information, PiD is computationally efficient and does not rely on any generative models for reconstruction. Specifically, PiD operates at the pixel level, mapping the pixel vector to another color space (e.g., YUV) and then quantizing the vector. The pixel vector is mapped back to the RGB space and the quantization loss is taken as the residual for AIGC detection. Our experiment results are striking and highly surprising: PiD achieves 98% accuracy on the widely used GenImage benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness and generalization performance.","We try to teach the neural network to distinguish fake and real images without relying on the obvious content flaws in this work. Fake images are generated from advanced generative models, like the frequently used Stable Diffusion and Flux models. The quality of generated images varies; some look very similar to the real images, while others may have different content flaws (like six fingers in a human image). Directly distinguishing fake images with content flaws or artifacts is easy for both AI and humans. However, we hope that AI or neural networks can also deal with hard cases that have no obvious flaws.Therefore, we propose to change the input to the neural networks and design a simple way that remove the content flaws from the image. While the rest component of the image cannot be easily classified by humans, we take it as the input to the neural network and explore whether the network can use it in the generalized AIGC detection. Interestingly, we found that this simple way effectively improves the ability of neural networks to distinguish fake images from different generative models. The method can be easily integrated and helps avoid the malicious application of generative models."
Poster,PieClam: A Universal Graph Autoencoder Based on Overlapping Inclusive and Exclusive Communities,https://ICML.cc//virtual/2025/poster/43754,"Daniel Zilberg, Ron Levie","We propose PieClam (Prior Inclusive Exclusive Cluster Affiliation Model): a graph autoencoder, where nodes are embedded into a code space by an algorithm that maximizes the log-likelihood of the decoded graph. PieClam is a community affiliation model that extends well-known methods like BigClam in two main manners. First, instead of the decoder being defined via pairwise interactions between the nodes in the code space, we also incorporate a learned prior on the distribution of nodes in the code space, turning our method into a graph generative model. Secondly, we generalize the notion of communities by allowing not only sets of nodes with strong connectivity, which we call inclusive communities, but also sets of nodes with strong disconnection, which we call exclusive communities. By introducing a new graph similarity measure, called the log cut distance, we show that PieClam is a universal autoencoder, able to uniformly approximately reconstruct any graph. Our method is shown to obtain competitive performance in graph anomaly detection and link prediction benchmarks.","We introduce PieClam, a novel model for analyzing graphs, like social networks. Our method interprets any graph as a collection of communities. PieClam identifies two types of communities within networks: inclusive communities, where nodes are closely connected, and exclusive communities, where nodes are strongly disconnected. As opposed to past methods, which only considered inclusive communities, our dual approach helps in better understanding the structure and behavior of networks. Moreover, unlike traditional methods, PieClam not only looks at how nodes in a graph are connected but also learns a way to randomly generate graphs which are similar to the given graph. On the theoretical side, we developed a new way to measure similarity between networks, called the log cut distance, which allows us to prove that PieClam is guaranteed to accurately represent and analyze any network whatsoever. On the application side, our experiments show that PieClam performs well in detecting anomalies in networks and predicting unseen connections in graphs."
Poster,PIGDreamer: Privileged Information Guided World Models for Safe Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning,https://ICML.cc//virtual/2025/poster/44134,"Dongchi Huang, Jiaqi WANG, Yang Li, Chunhe Xia, Tianle Zhang, Kaige Zhang","Partial observability presents a significant challenge for safe reinforcement learning, as it impedes the identification of potential risks and rewards. Leveraging specific types of privileged information during training to mitigate the effects of partial observability has yielded notable empirical successes. In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs) to theoretically examine the advantages of incorporating privileged information. Building upon ACPOMDPs, we propose the Privileged Information Guided Dreamer, a model-based safe reinforcement learning approach that leverages privileged information to enhance the agent's safety and performance through privileged representation alignment and an asymmetric actor-critic structure. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of safety and task-centric performance. Meanwhile, compared to alternative privileged model-based reinforcement learning methods, our approach exhibits superior performance and ease of training.","Teaching robots to stay safe when they can’t see everything is tricky. Since their sensors are limited, they might miss important dangers, making it hard to avoid risky situations. We want to address this challenge by leveraging extra sensors in the teaching process to equip robots with better danger sense abilities, thereby enhancing its dangerous avoidance ability.  We developed a framework called *Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs)* to show how adding extra sensors during training can help robots better understand their surroundings. Using this framework, we created an algorithm called the *Privileged Information Guided Dreamer*. This algorithm aligns the extra sensor data with the robot’s understanding of the world, improving its ability to avoid dangers and perform tasks safely. Our work improves how robots use extra sensor data to better understand their environment. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in safety navigation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in real-world scenarios."
Poster,PILAF: Optimal Human Preference Sampling for Reward Modeling,https://ICML.cc//virtual/2025/poster/45334,"Yunzhen Feng, Ariel Kwiatkowski, Kunhao Zheng, Julia Kempe, Yaqi Duan","As large language models increasingly drive real-world applications, aligning them with human values becomes paramount. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique, translating preference data into reward models when oracle human values remain inaccessible. In practice, RLHF mostly relies on approximate reward models, which may not consistently guide the policy toward maximizing the underlying human values. We propose Policy-Interpolated Learning for Aligned Feedback (PILAF), a novel response sampling strategy for preference labeling that explicitly aligns preference learning with maximizing the underlying oracle reward. PILAF is theoretically grounded, demonstrating optimality from  both an optimization and a statistical perspective. The method is straightforward to implement and demonstrates strong performance in iterative and online RLHF settings where feedback curation is critical.","As artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly influences real-world applications, it becomes essential to ensure AI systems align with human values. However, accurately capturing these values is challenging because human preferences aren't always easy to measure or clearly defined. A common approach, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), tries to teach AI what humans prefer by creating models based on feedback, but this feedback isn't always precise enough to guide AI effectively.Our research introduces Policy-Interpolated Learning for Aligned Feedback (PILAF), a new response sampling method designed to improve how AI learns from human preferences. PILAF helps ensure that AI behavior closely matches the true values humans have in mind, even if direct measures of these values are unavailable. By integrating the process of selecting responses for human feedback more effectively, PILAF ensures the learning method consistently moves toward better alignment with actual human preferences.This approach is both theoretically sound and easy to implement, showing notable improvements in scenarios where efficient and accurate human feedback is essential, thereby making AI systems safer and more reliable."
