Poster,GenZSL: Generative Zero-Shot Learning Via Inductive Variational Autoencoder,https://ICML.cc//virtual/2025/poster/46164,"Shiming Chen, Dingjie Fu, Salman Khan, Fahad Khan","Remarkable progress in zero-shot learning (ZSL) has been achieved using generative models. However, existing generative ZSL methods merely generate (imagine) the visual features from scratch guided by the strong class semantic vectors annotated by experts, resulting in suboptimal generative performance and limited scene generalization. To address these and advance ZSL, we propose an inductive variational autoencoder for generative zero-shot learning, dubbed GenZSL. Mimicking human-level concept learning, GenZSL operates by inducting new class samples from similar seen classes using weak class semantic vectors derived from target class names (i.e., CLIP text embedding). To ensure the generation of informative samples for training an effective ZSL classifier, our GenZSL incorporates two key strategies. Firstly, it employs class diversity promotion to enhance the diversity of class semantic vectors. Secondly, it utilizes target class-guided information boosting criteria to optimize the model. Extensive experiments conducted on three popular benchmark datasets showcase the superiority and potential of our GenZSL with significant efficacy and efficiency over f-VAEGAN, e.g., 24.7\% performance gains and more than $60\times$ faster training speed on AWA2. Codes are available at \url{https://github.com/shiming-chen/GenZSL}.","We propose an inductive variational autoencoder as a new generative model for zero-shot learning, namely GenZSL. Inspired by human perception, GenZSL operates on an induction-based approach to synthesize informative and high-quality sample features for unseen classes. To achieve this, we introduce class diversity promotion to enhance the diversity and discrimination of class semantic vectors. Additionally, we design two losses targeting the criteria of target class-guided information boosting to optimize the model.Through qualitative and quantitative analyses, we demonstrate that GenZSL consistently outperforms existing generative ZSL methods in terms of efficacy and efficiency."
Poster,Geometric Algebra Planes: Convex Implicit Neural Volumes,https://ICML.cc//virtual/2025/poster/43546,"Irmak Sivgin, Sara Fridovich-Keil, Gordon Wetzstein, Mert Pilanci","Volume parameterizations abound in recent literature, encompassing methods from classic voxel grids to implicit neural representations. While implicit representations offer impressive capacity and improved memory efficiency compared to voxel grids, they traditionally require training through nonconvex optimization, which can be slow and sensitive to initialization and hyperparameters. We introduce GA-Planes, a novel family of implicit neural volume representations inspired by Geometric Algebra that can be trained using convex optimization, addressing the limitations of nonconvex methods. GA-Planes models generalize many existing representations including any combination of features stored in tensor basis elements followed by a neural feature decoder, and can be adapted to convex or nonconvex training as needed for various inverse problems. In the 2D setting, we prove GA-Planes models are equivalent to a low-rank plus low-resolution matrix factorization that outperforms the classic low-rank plus sparse decomposition for fitting a natural image. In 3D, GA-Planes models exhibit competitive expressiveness, model size, and optimizability across tasks such as radiance field reconstruction, 3D segmentation, and video segmentation.","This paper introduces GA-Planes (Geometric Algebra Planes), a new method for representing 3D objects and scenes. In computer graphics and machine learning, various formats—like grids, neural networks, or combinations of both—are commonly used to store and process 3D data. Implicit representations are a popular choice because they offer high capacity and memory efficiency compared to traditional volumetric grids. However, they are often difficult and slow to train due to complex, nonconvex optimization.GA-Planes addresses this challenge by using ideas from Geometric Algebra to create a more efficient and stable representation that supports convex optimization. It generalizes many existing methods that combine learnable position-dependent feature grids with neural decoders. By enabling convex training, GA-Planes reduces reliance on careful initialization and tuning.The authors demonstrate that GA-Planes is versatile and can be applied to a wide range of tasks, including 2D image fitting, 3D scene reconstruction, and video representation."
Poster,Geometric and Physical Constraints Synergistically Enhance Neural PDE Surrogates,https://ICML.cc//virtual/2025/poster/46367,"Yunfei Huang, David S. Greenberg","Neural PDE surrogates can improve the cost-accuracy tradeoff of classical solvers, but often generalize poorly to new initial conditions and accumulate errors over time. Physical and symmetry constraints have shown promise in closing this performance gap, but existing techniques for imposing these inductive biases are incompatible with the staggered grids commonly used in computational fluid dynamics. Here we introduce novel input and output layers that respect physical laws and symmetries on the staggered grids, and for the first time systematically investigate how these constraints, individually and in combination, affect the accuracy of PDE surrogates. We focus on two challenging problems: shallow water equations with closed boundaries and decaying incompressible turbulence. Compared to strong baselines, symmetries and physical constraints consistently improve performance across tasks, architectures, autoregressive prediction steps, accuracy measures, and network sizes. Symmetries are more effective than physical constraints, but surrogates with both performed best, even compared to baselines with data augmentation or pushforward training, while themselves benefiting from the pushforward trick. Doubly-constrained surrogates also generalize better to initial conditions and durations beyond the range of the training data, and more accurately predict real-world ocean currents.","Partial differential equation (PDE) solvers use scientific knowledge to predict how physical systems evolve: they are accurate but often slow. Neural networks can learn to predict the same results more quickly, but can be inaccurate or unstable when predicting too far into the future. To get the best of both worlds, these networks can be cleverly constructed to mimic some aspects the physical systems they predict.We focus on two such aspects. First, we impose the conservation of physical quantities such as mass or momentum, which for certain PDEs should never be created or destroyed. Second, we force the network to respect the geometric symmetries of the PDE: for example, rotating or otherwise transforming the initial conditions of should transform the predicted solution. Both of these aspects have been use to improve neural PDE predictions before, but we carefully evaluate their combination for the first time. To do this, we created new network components to for symmetries on special grids used in fluid dynamics, with staggered spacing between variables.Overall, we were able to confirm the usefulness of combined physical and symmetry constraints. Our results are promising for ML-based prediction of weather, climate and other fluid dynamical systems."
Poster,Geometric Contact Flows: Contactomorphisms for Dynamics and Control,https://ICML.cc//virtual/2025/poster/43700,"Andrea Testa, Søren Hauberg, Tamim Asfour, Leonel Rozo","Accurately modeling and predicting complex dynamical systems, particularly those involving force exchange and dissipation, is crucial for applications ranging from fluid dynamics to robotics, but presents significant challenges due to the intricate interplay of geometric constraints and energy transfer. This paper introduces Geometric Contact Flows (GFC), a novel framework leveraging Riemannian and Contact geometry as inductive biases to learn such systems. GCF constructs a latent contact Hamiltonian model encoding desirable properties like stability or energy conservation. An ensemble of contactomorphisms then adapts this model to the target dynamics while preserving these properties. This ensemble allows for uncertainty-aware geodesics that attract the system’s behavior toward the data support, enabling robust generalization and adaptation to unseen scenarios. Experiments on learning dynamics for physical systems and for controlling robots on interaction tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","AI models can be trained to understand the evolution over time of systems like a swinging pendulum, a river flowing downhill, or a person loading a dishwasher. Learning these dynamic behaviors helps in two ways: it enables to predict natural phenomena and teaches machines (like robots) to execute physical tasks. The data from these real-world events reflects underlying physical laws, which imprint recognizable patterns. If a model misses these patterns, it struggles to learn the behavior, especially with limited data.We address this challenge with a model that lets users incorporate partial knowledge about the dynamics, for example by indicating whether the behavior should be periodic or eventually settle down. The model uses this guidance to fit the available data in a way that remains physically consistent, thanks to built-in constraints that preserve the specified behavior during prediction. These constraints are based on contact Hamiltonian theory, a mathematical framework that describes physical systems as motion through a geometric space. In this context, adapting the suggested dynamics while respecting physical laws is known as a contactomorphism.Our novel model, the first to use contactomorphisms for reconstructing and controlling physical dynamics, surpasses previous approaches in performance, advancing the state of the art."
Poster,Geometric Feature Embedding for Effective 3D Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning,https://ICML.cc//virtual/2025/poster/46035,"Xiangqi Li, Libo Huang, Zhulin An, Weilun Feng, Chuanguang Yang, Boyu Diao, Fei Wang, Yongjun Xu","3D few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to learn new point cloud categories from limited samples while preventing the forgetting of previously learned categories. This research area significantly enhances the capabilities of self-driving vehicles and computer vision systems. Existing 3D FSCIL approaches primarily utilize multimodal pre-trained models to extract the semantic features, heavily dependent on meticulously designed high-quality prompts and fine-tuning strategies. To reduce this dependence, this paper proposes a novel method for **3D** **F**SCI**L** with **E**mbedded **G**eometric features (**3D-FLEG**). Specifically, 3D-FLEG develops a point cloud *geometric feature extraction module* to capture category-related geometric characteristics. To address the modality heterogeneity issues that arise from integrating geometric and text features, 3D-FLEG introduces a *geometric feature embedding module*. By augmenting text prompts with spatial geometric features through these modules, 3D-FLEG can learn robust representations of new categories even with limited samples, while mitigating forgetting of the previously learned categories. Experiments conducted on several publicly available 3D point cloud datasets, including ModelNet, ShapeNet, ScanObjectNN, and CO3D, demonstrate 3D-FLEG's superiority over existing state-of-the-art 3D FSCIL methods. Code is available at https://github.com/lixiangqi707/3D-FLEG.","3D Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL) is an emerging research area with significant potential to enhance the adaptability and perception capabilities of autonomous systems and computer vision applications. Current approaches predominantly rely on multimodal pre-trained models for semantic feature extraction, which often require carefully designed prompts and elaborate fine-tuning strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named 3D-FLEG, aiming to reduce this dependency. 3D-FLEG integrates geometric features with textual prompts through a geometric feature extraction and embedding module, effectively leveraging the spatial structure of 3D data. This approach significantly alleviates the reliance on complex textual descriptions, particularly in few-shot settings, enabling robust recognition of novel classes while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both within-dataset and cross-dataset 3D FSCIL benchmarks."
Poster,Geometric Generative Modeling with Noise-Conditioned Graph Networks,https://ICML.cc//virtual/2025/poster/46557,"Peter Pao-Huang, Mitchell Black, Xiaojie Qiu","Generative modeling of graphs with spatial structure is essential across many applications from computer graphics to spatial genomics. Recent flow-based generative models have achieved impressive results by gradually adding and then learning to remove noise from these graphs. Existing models, however, use graph neural network architectures that are independent of the noise level, limiting their expressiveness. To address this issue, we introduce *Noise-Conditioned Graph Networks* (NCGNs), a class of graph neural networks that dynamically modify their architecture according to the noise level during generation. Our theoretical and empirical analysis reveals that as noise increases, (1) graphs require information from increasingly distant neighbors and (2) graphs can be effectively represented at lower resolutions. Based on these insights, we develop Dynamic Message Passing (DMP), a specific instantiation of NCGNs that adapts both the range and resolution of message passing to the noise level. DMP consistently outperforms noise independent architectures on a variety of domains including $3$D point clouds, spatiotemporal transcriptomics, and images.","Modern AI generates realistic geometric objects through a process that starts with pure noise (similar to static on a TV screen) and gradually learns to reverse this noise back into recognizable objects such as cars, furniture, or human organs. However, current AI systems use the same rigid neural network throughout this entire noise-removal process, like using the same tool to both create the scaffolding of a building and paint fine details. This one-size-fits-all approach limits the quality of generated objects because different stages of noise removal require different processing strategies.We developed *Noise-Conditioned Graph Networks* that work like a smart contractor who uses different tools for different stages of construction—heavy machinery for rough work and fine brushes for detailed finishing. Our AI dynamically changes how it processes information during the noise-removal process: at early, very noisy stages, it looks broadly at distant relationships and works with simplified representations, while at later, nearly clean stages, it focuses locally on fine details with full resolution. This adaptive approach is backed by mathematical theory showing that optimal information gathering requires different strategies at different noise levels.Our method improves 3D shape generation, biological data modeling, and image generation. The technique requires minimal code changes to implement, making it immediately practical for existing AI systems. This work could accelerate advances in computer graphics, medical imaging, drug discovery, and any field requiring geometric modeling, bringing us closer to AI that truly understands and creates the geometric world around us."
Poster,Geometric Hyena Networks for Large-scale Equivariant Learning,https://ICML.cc//virtual/2025/poster/44308,"Artem Moskalev, Mangal Prakash, Junjie Xu, Tianyu Cui, Rui Liao, Tommaso Mansi","Processing global geometric context while preserving equivariance is crucial when modeling biological, chemical, and physical systems. Yet, this is challenging due to the computational demands of equivariance and global context at scale. Standard methods such as equivariant self-attention suffer from quadratic complexity, while local methods such as distance-based message passing sacrifice global information. Inspired by the recent success of state-space and long-convolutional models, we introduce Geometric Hyena, the first equivariant long-convolutional model for geometric systems. Geometric Hyena captures global geometric context at sub-quadratic complexity while maintaining equivariance to rotations and translations. Evaluated on all-atom property prediction of large RNA molecules and full protein molecular dynamics, Geometric Hyena outperforms existing equivariant models while requiring significantly less memory and compute that equivariant self-attention. Notably, our model processes the geometric context of $30k$ tokens $20 \times$ faster than the equivariant transformer and allows $72 \times$ longer context within the same budget.","Many scientific problems such as predicting the properties or structures of proteins and RNAs require understanding the organization of geometric systems. To be robust, models must respect physical symmetries like rotation and translation. However, standard models that support processing such symmetries either consume too much memory or struggle to capture long-range relationships.To address this, we developed Geometric Hyena, a new model designed to efficiently handle large and complex geometric data. It uses a method called long convolution to capture how different parts of a molecule relate to each other, even over great distances, while keeping computation fast and memory use low.Geometric Hyena outperforms existing methods in predicting how RNA degrades and how proteins move, tasks with real-world impact in drug discovery and biological research. Notably, our model can process much longer geometric systems—millions of input tokens—on a single standard GPU. This makes it a powerful and accessible tool for researchers studying large geometric structures such as biomolecules."
Poster,Geometric Median (GM) Matching for Robust k-Subset Selection from Noisy Data,https://ICML.cc//virtual/2025/poster/43976,"Anish Acharya, Sujay Sanghavi, Alex Dimakis, Inderjit Dhillon","Data pruning -- the combinatorial task of selecting a small and representative subset from a large dataset, is crucial for mitigating the enormous computational costs associated with training data-hungry modern deep learning models at scale. Since large-scale data collections are invariably noisy, developing data pruning strategies that remain robust even in the presence of corruption is critical in practice. Existing data pruning methods often fail under high corruption rates due to their reliance on empirical mean estimation, which is highly sensitive to outliers. In response, this work proposes Geometric Median (GM) Matching, a novel k-subset selection strategy that leverages the Geometric Median (GM) , a robust estimator with an optimal breakdown point of 1/2; to enhance resilience against noisy data. Our method iteratively selects a $k$-subset such that the mean of the subset approximates the GM of the (potentially) noisy dataset, ensuring robustness even under arbitrary corruption. We provide theoretical guarantees, showing that GM Matching enjoys an improved $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ convergence rate, outperforming $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$ scaling of uniform sampling, even under arbitrary corruption. Extensive experiments across image classification and image generation tasks demonstrate that GM Matching consistently outperforms existing pruning approaches, particularly in high-corruption settings; making it a strong baseline for robust data pruning.","Today’s AI systems are trained on enormous datasets — millions of images, texts, or videos — but not all that data is helpful. In fact, a lot of it is messy: mislabeled, corrupted, or just plain misleading. Training on this kind of data not only wastes time and energy, it can actively hurt performance.So, what if we could pick only the right data — the most reliable, representative examples — and throw out the rest ?That’s the idea behind this paper. We introduce Geometric Median Matching, a new way to carefully prune down large datasets to their cleanest, most informative core. Unlike existing methods that rely on averages — which can be easily thrown off by just a few bad examples — we use a more robust tool called the geometric median. It finds the “true center” of the data in a way that naturally resists noise and outliers. We then select a small subset of the data that best matches this stable center. The result is a dramatically smaller training set that still teaches the model everything it needs to know — and often does it better. Even if up to half the data is corrupted, our method still works. Across tasks like image recognition and image generation, this approach trains models faster, uses less compute, and produces better results.In short: we show how AI can learn more by training on less — if you choose the right data."
Poster,Geometric Representation Condition Improves Equivariant Molecule Generation,https://ICML.cc//virtual/2025/poster/46339,"Zian Li, Cai Zhou, Xiyuan Wang, Xingang Peng, Muhan Zhang","Recent advances in molecular generative models have demonstrated great promise for accelerating scientific discovery, particularly in drug design. However, these models often struggle to generate high-quality molecules, especially in conditional scenarios where specific molecular properties must be satisfied. In this work, we introduce GeoRCG, a general framework to improve molecular generative models by integrating geometric representation conditions with provable theoretical guarantees. We decompose the generation process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric representation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on the representation. Compared with single-stage generation, the easy-to-generate representation in the first stage guides the second stage generation toward a high-quality molecule in a goal-oriented way. Leveraging EDM and SemlaFlow as base generators, we observe significant quality improvements in unconditional molecule generation on the widely used QM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets. More notably, in the challenging conditional molecular generation task, our framework achieves an average 50\% performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the superiority of conditioning on semantically rich geometric representations. Furthermore, with such representation guidance, the number of diffusion steps can be reduced to as small as 100 while largely preserving the generation quality achieved with 1,000 steps, thereby significantly reducing the generation iterations needed.","Designing new drugs with specific properties is a complex and time-consuming task. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence offer hope by designing models to quickly generate potential molecules based on patterns they’ve learned from plenty of data. However, these generative models often struggle to produce high-quality molecules, especially when specific characteristics are required.To address this, we introduced GeoRCG, a new method that enhances generative models' ability to generate better molecules. Instead of creating a molecule in a single step, our approach breaks the process into two stages. First, it generates an informative representation—a numerical vector that captures the molecule’s essential features in a way the computer can easily learn and understand. Then, this representation guides the generation of the actual molecule. This two-step method keeps the AI focused and efficient, resulting in higher-quality molecules through a goal-oriented process.GeoRCG can be integrated into any molecule generative model. In our experiments, it substantially improves well-known models like EDM and SemlaFlow, delivering consistent enhancements in unconditional molecule generation and achieving a 31\% improvement in generating molecules with specific properties. Additionally, it accelerates the generation process by reducing the number of iterations required, making it a valuable tool for advancing drug design and discovery."
Poster,Geometric Resampling in Nearly Linear Time for Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader with Best-of-Both-Worlds Guarantee in Bandit Problems,https://ICML.cc//virtual/2025/poster/44768,"Botao Chen, Jongyeong Lee, Junya Honda","This paper studies the complexity and optimality of Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) policy in the $K$-armed bandit problems. FTPL is a promising policy that achieves the Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) guarantee without solving an optimization problem unlike Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL). However, FTPL needs a procedure called geometric resampling to estimate the loss, which needs $O(K^2)$ per-round average complexity, usually worse than that of FTRL. To address this issue, we propose a novel technique, which we call Conditional Geometric Resampling (CGR), for unbiased loss estimation applicable to general perturbation distributions. CGR reduces the average complexity to $O(K\log K)$ without sacrificing the regret bounds. We also propose a biased version of CGR that can control the worst-case complexity while keeping the BOBW guarantee for a certain perturbation distribution. We confirm through experiments that CGR does not only significantly improve the average and worst-case runtime but also achieve better regret thanks to the stable loss estimation.","Imagine you're playing a game with several slot machines, each giving different rewards. Your goal is to win as much as possible, but you don't know which machine is the best at first, and you have limited chances to find out. You need a smart strategy to balance learning about the machines and earning rewards. This classic dilemma shows up in many real-world settings like online recommendations and clinical trials.In this paper, we propose a new method that helps computers make better decisions in such uncertain situations. It speeds up the learning process by reducing the need for repeated trial and error, while still making accurate choices. Our approach works well even when the environment changes over time and is much faster than existing methods, making it more practical for real-world use."
