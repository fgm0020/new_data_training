Poster,MMDT: Decoding the Trustworthiness and Safety of Multimodal Foundation Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28256,"Chejian Xu, Jiawei Zhang, Zhaorun Chen, Chulin Xie, Mintong Kang, Yujin Potter, Zhun Wang, Zhuowen Yuan, Alexander Xiong, Zidi Xiong, Chenhui Zhang, Lingzhi Yuan, Yi Zeng, Peiyang Xu, Chengquan Guo, Andy Zhou, Jeffrey Tan, Xuandong Zhao, Francesco Pinto, Zhen Xiang, Yu Gai, Zinan Lin, Dan Hendrycks, Bo Li, Dawn Song","Multimodal foundation models (MMFMs) play a crucial role in various applications, including autonomous driving, healthcare, and virtual assistants. However, several studies have revealed vulnerabilities in these models, such as generating unsafe content by text-to-image models. Existing benchmarks on multimodal models either predominantly assess the helpfulness of these models, or only focus on limited perspectives such as fairness and privacy. In this paper, we present the first unified platform, MMDT (Multimodal DecodingTrust), designed to provide a comprehensive safety and trustworthiness evaluation for MMFMs. Our platform assesses models from multiple perspectives, including safety, hallucination, fairness/bias, privacy, adversarial robustness, and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We have designed various evaluation scenarios and red teaming algorithms under different tasks for each perspective to generate challenging data, forming a high-quality benchmark. We evaluate a range of multimodal models using MMDT, and our findings reveal a series of vulnerabilities and areas for improvement across these perspectives. This work introduces the first comprehensive and unique safety and trustworthiness evaluation platform for MMFMs, paving the way for developing safer and more reliable MMFMs and systems. Our platform and benchmark are available at https://mmdecodingtrust.github.io/."
Poster,MMed-RAG: Versatile Multimodal RAG System for Medical Vision Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28145,"Peng Xia, Kangyu Zhu, Haoran Li, Tianze Wang, Weijia Shi, Sheng Wang, Linjun Zhang, James Y Zou, Huaxiu Yao","Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in healthcare, particularly in disease diagnosis and treatment planning. Recent progress in Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) has opened up new possibilities for interactive diagnostic tools. However, these models often suffer from factual hallucination, which can lead to incorrect diagnoses. Fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have emerged as methods to address these issues. However, the amount of high-quality data and distribution shifts between training data and deployment data limit the application of fine-tuning methods. Although RAG is lightweight and effective, existing RAG-based approaches are not sufficiently general to different medical domains and can potentially cause misalignment issues, both between modalities and between the model and the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a versatile multimodal RAG system, MMed-RAG, designed to enhance the factuality of Med-LVLMs. Our approach introduces a domain-aware retrieval mechanism, an adaptive retrieved contexts selection, and a provable RAG-based preference fine-tuning strategy. These innovations make the RAG process sufficiently general and reliable, significantly improving alignment when introducing retrieved contexts. Experimental results across five medical datasets (involving radiology, ophthalmology, pathology) on medical VQA and report generation demonstrate that MMed-RAG can achieve an average improvement of 43.8% in factual accuracy in the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs."
Poster,MMEgo: Towards Building Egocentric Multimodal LLMs for Video QA,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30907,"Hanrong Ye, Haotian Zhang, Erik Daxberger, Lin Chen, Zongyu Lin, Yanghao Li, Bowen Zhang, Haoxuan You, Dan Xu, Zhe Gan, Jiasen Lu, Yinfei Yang","This research aims to comprehensively explore building a multimodal foundation model for egocentric video understanding.To achieve this goal, we work on three fronts. First, as there is a lack of QA data for egocentric video understanding, we automatically generate 7M high-quality QA samples for egocentric videos ranging from 30 seconds to one hour long in Ego4D based on human-annotated data.This is one of the largest egocentric QA datasets.Second, we contribute a challenging egocentric QA benchmark with 629 videos and 7,026 questions to evaluate the models' ability in recognizing and memorizing visual details across videos of varying lengths. We introduce a new de-biasing evaluation method to help mitigate the unavoidable language bias present in the models being evaluated.Third, we propose a specialized multimodal architecture featuring a novel ``Memory Pointer Prompting"" mechanism. This design includes a global glimpse step to gain an overarching understanding of the entire video and identify key visual information, followed by a fallback step that utilizes the key visual information to generate responses. This enables the model to more effectively comprehend extended video content.With the data, benchmark, and model, we build MM-Ego, an egocentric multimodal LLM that shows powerful performance on egocentric video understanding."
Poster,MM-EMBED: UNIVERSAL MULTIMODAL RETRIEVAL WITH MULTIMODAL LLMS,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28720,"Sheng-Chieh Lin, Chankyu Lee, Mohammad Shoeybi, Jimmy Lin, Bryan Catanzaro, Wei Ping","State-of-the-art retrieval models typically address a straightforward search scenario, in which retrieval tasks are fixed (e.g., finding a passage to answer a specific question) and only a single modality is supported for both queries and retrieved results. This paper introduces techniques for advancing information retrieval with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), enabling a broader search scenario, termed universal multimodal retrieval, where multiple modalities and diverse retrieval tasks are accommodated. To this end, we first study fine-tuning an MLLM as a bi-encoder retriever on 10 datasets with 16 retrieval tasks. Our empirical results show that the fine-tuned MLLM retriever is capable of understanding challenging queries, composed of both text and image, but it underperforms compared to a smaller CLIP retriever in cross-modal retrieval tasks due to the modality bias exhibited by MLLMs. To address the issue, we propose modality-aware hard negative mining to mitigate the modality bias exhibited by MLLM retrievers. Second, we propose continuously fine-tuning the universal multimodal retriever to enhance its text retrieval capability while preserving multimodal retrieval capability. As a result, our model, MM-Embed, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multimodal retrieval benchmark M-BEIR, which spans multiple domains and tasks, while also surpassing the state-of-the-art text retrieval model, NV-Embed-v1, on the MTEB retrieval benchmark. Finally, we explore prompting the off-the-shelf MLLMs as zero-shot rerankers to refine the ranking of the candidates from the multimodal retriever. We find that, through prompt-and-reranking, MLLMs can further improve multimodal retrieval when the user queries (e.g., text-image composed queries) are more complex and challenging to understand. These findings also pave the way for advancing universal multimodal retrieval in the future. We release the model weights at: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/MM-Embed."
Poster,MME-RealWorld: Could Your Multimodal LLM Challenge High-Resolution Real-World Scenarios that are Difficult for Humans?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28598,"YiFan Zhang, Huanyu Zhang, Haochen Tian, Chaoyou Fu, Shuangqing Zhang, Junfei Wu, Feng Li, Kun Wang, Qingsong Wen, Zhang Zhang, Liang Wang, Rong Jin","Comprehensive evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has recently garnered widespread attention in the research community. However, we observe that existing benchmarks present several common barriers that make it difficult to measure the significant challenges that models face in the real world, including: 1) small data scale leads to a large performance variance; 2) reliance on model-based annotations results in restricted data quality; 3) insufficient task difficulty, especially caused by the limited image resolution. To tackle these issues, we introduce MME-RealWorld. Specifically, we collect more than $300$ K images from public datasets and the Internet, filtering $13,366$ high-quality images for annotation. This involves the efforts of professional $25$ annotators and $7$ experts in MLLMs, contributing to $29,429$ question-answer pairs that cover $43$ subtasks across $5$ real-world scenarios, extremely challenging even for humans. As far as we know, **MME-RealWorld is the largest manually annotated benchmark to date, featuring the highest resolution and a targeted focus on real-world applications**. We further conduct a thorough evaluation involving $29$ prominent MLLMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Our results show that even the most advanced models struggle with our benchmarks, where none of them reach 60\% accuracy. The challenges of perceiving high-resolution images and understanding complex real-world scenarios remain urgent issues to be addressed. The data and evaluation code are released in our Project Page."
Poster,MMFakeBench: A Mixed-Source Multimodal Misinformation Detection Benchmark for LVLMs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30477,"Xuannan Liu, Zekun Li, Pei Li, Huaibo Huang, Shuhan Xia, Xing Cui, Linzhi Huang, Weihong Deng, Zhaofeng He","Current multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) methods often assume a single source and type of forgery for each sample, which is insufficient for real-world scenarios where multiple forgery sources coexist. The lack of a benchmark for mixed-source misinformation has hindered progress in this field. To address this, we introduce MMFakeBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for mixed-source MMD. MMFakeBench includes 3 critical sources: textual veracity distortion, visual veracity distortion, and cross-modal consistency distortion, along with 12 sub-categories of misinformation forgery types. We further conduct an extensive evaluation of 6 prevalent detection methods and 15 Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on MMFakeBench under a zero-shot setting. The results indicate that current methods struggle under this challenging and realistic mixed-source MMD setting. Additionally, we propose MMD-Agent, a novel approach to integrate the reasoning, action, and tool-use capabilities of LVLM agents, significantly enhancing accuracy and generalization. We believe this study will catalyze future research into more realistic mixed-source multimodal misinformation and provide a fair evaluation of misinformation detection methods."
Poster,MMIE: Massive Multimodal Interleaved Comprehension Benchmark for Large Vision-Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30211,"Peng Xia, Siwei Han, Shi Qiu, Yiyang Zhou, Zhaoyang Wang, Wenhao Zheng, Zhaorun Chen, Chenhang Cui, Mingyu Ding, Linjie Li, Lijuan Wang, Huaxiu Yao","Interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation, enabling models to produce and interpret both images and text in arbitrary sequences, have become a pivotal area in multimodal learning. Despite significant advancements, the evaluation of this capability remains insufficient. Existing benchmarks suffer from limitations in data scale, scope, and evaluation depth, while current evaluation metrics are often costly or biased, lacking in reliability for practical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce MMIE, a large-scale knowledge-intensive benchmark for evaluating interleaved multimodal comprehension and generation in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). MMIE comprises 20K meticulously curated multimodal queries, spanning 3 categories, 12 fields, and 102 subfields, including mathematics, coding, physics, literature, health, and arts. It supports both interleaved inputs and outputs, offering a mix of multiple-choice and open-ended question formats to evaluate diverse competencies. Moreover, we propose a reliable automated evaluation metric, leveraging a scoring model fine-tuned with human-annotated data and systematic evaluation criteria, aimed at reducing bias and improving evaluation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and metrics in providing a comprehensive evaluation of interleaved LVLMs. Specifically, we evaluate eight LVLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results. We believe MMIE will drive further advancements in the development of interleaved LVLMs."
Poster,MMIU: Multimodal Multi-image Understanding for Evaluating Large Vision-Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29339,"Fanqing Meng, Jin Wang, Chuanhao Li, Quanfeng Lu, Hao Tian, Tianshuo Yang, Jiaqi Liao, Xizhou Zhu, Jifeng Dai, Yu Qiao, Ping Luo, Kaipeng Zhang, Wenqi Shao","The capability to process multiple images is crucial for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to develop a more thorough and nuanced understanding of a scene. Recent multi-image LVLMs have begun to address this need. However, their evaluation has not kept pace with their development. To fill this gap, we introduce the Multimodal Multi-image Understanding (MMIU) benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to assess LVLMs across a wide range of multi-image tasks. MMIU encompasses 7 types of multi-image relationships, 52 tasks, 77K images, and 11K meticulously curated multiple-choice questions, making it the most extensive benchmark of its kind. Our evaluation of nearly 30 popular LVLMs, including both open-source and proprietary models, reveals significant challenges in multi-image comprehension, particularly in tasks involving spatial understanding. Even the most advanced models, such as GPT-4o, achieve only 55.7\% accuracy on MMIU. Through multi-faceted analytical experiments, we identify key performance gaps and limitations, providing valuable insights for future model and data improvements. We aim for MMIU to advance the frontier of LVLM research and development. We release the data and code at https://github.com/MMIUBenchmark/MMIU."
Poster,MMKE-Bench: A Multimodal Editing Benchmark for Diverse Visual Knowledge,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27931,"yuntao du, Kailin Jiang, Zhi Gao, Chenrui Shi, Zilong Zheng, Siyuan Qi, Qing Li","Knowledge editing techniques have emerged as essential tools for updating the factual knowledge of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models (LMMs), allowing them to correct outdated or inaccurate information without retraining from scratch. However, existing benchmarks for multimodal knowledge editing primarily focus on entity-level knowledge represented as simple triplets, which fail to capture the complexity of real-world multimodal information. To address this issue, we introduce MMKE-Bench, a comprehensive **M**ulti**M**odal **K**nowledge **E**diting Benchmark, designed to evaluate the ability of LMMs to edit diverse visual knowledge in real-world scenarios. MMKE-Bench addresses these limitations by incorporating three types of editing tasks: visual entity editing, visual semantic editing, and user-specific editing.  Besides, MMKE-Bench uses free-form natural language to represent and edit knowledge, offering a more flexible and effective format. The benchmark consists of 2,940 pieces of knowledge and 8,363 images across 33 broad categories, with evaluation questions automatically generated and human-verified. We assess five state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods on three prominent LMMs, revealing that no method excels across all criteria, and that visual and user-specific edits are particularly challenging. MMKE-Bench sets a new standard for evaluating the robustness of multimodal knowledge editing techniques, driving progress in this rapidly evolving field."
Poster,MMQA: Evaluating LLMs with Multi-Table Multi-Hop Complex Questions,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30290,"Jian Wu, Linyi Yang, Dongyuan Li, Yuliang Ji, Manabu Okumura, Yue Zhang","While large language models (LLMs) have made strides in understanding tabular data, current tabular evaluation benchmarks, such as WikiTableQuestions and WikiSQL, are focus on single-table scenarios, which cannot necessarily reflect the complexity of real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we present a \textbf{M}ulti-table and Multi-hop Question Answering (MMQA) dataset to assess LLMs' understanding and reasoning capabilities in handling multi-table tasks. The MMQA dataset demands that models perform multiple inferences by drawing evidence from various tables, which are designed to be connected with each other and require models to identify and utilize relationships such as foreign and primary keys. Then, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework that tailors to assess LLMs' capabilities in several aspects including Multi-Table Retrieval, Text-to-SQL Generation, Multi-Table QA, Primary Key Selection, and Foreign Key Selection. Finally, we propose a novel multi-table retrieval method that achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the MMQA dataset compared to several strong baselines. Our experiment results reveal that, compared with human performance, both open-source and commercial LLMs leave significant performance room for improvements in multi-table understanding and reasoning tasks. We believe that the MMQA benchmark will enhance and facilitate LLMs' multi-table capabilities in real-world scenarios."
