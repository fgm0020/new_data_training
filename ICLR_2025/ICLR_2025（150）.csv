Poster,Harnessing Diversity for Important Data Selection in Pretraining Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29114,"Chi Zhang, Huaping Zhong, Kuan Zhang, Chengliang Chai, Rui Wang, Xinlin Zhuang, Tianyi Bai, Qiu Jiantao, Lei Cao, Ju Fan, Ye Yuan, Guoren Wang, Conghui He","Data selection is of great significance in  pretraining large language models, given the  variation in quality within the large-scale available training corpora. To achieve this, researchers are currently investigating the use of data influence to measure the importance of data instances, $i.e.,$ a high influence score indicates that incorporating this instance to the training set is likely to enhance the model performance. Consequently, they select the top-$k$ instances with the highest scores.  However, this approach has several limitations. (1) Calculating the accurate influence of all available data is time-consuming.(2) The selected data instances are not diverse enough, which may hinder the pretrained model's ability to generalize effectively to various downstream tasks.In this paper, we introduce $\texttt{Quad}$, a data selection approach that considers both quality and diversity by using data influence to achieve state-of-the-art pretraining results.To compute the influence ($i.e.,$ the quality) more accurately and efficiently, we incorporate the attention layers to capture more semantic details, which can be accelerated through the Kronecker product. For the diversity, $\texttt{Quad}$ clusters the dataset into similar data instances within each cluster and diverse instances across different clusters. For each cluster, if we opt to select data from it, we take some samples to evaluate the influence to prevent processing all instances. Overall, we favor clusters with highly influential instances (ensuring high quality) or clusters that have been selected less frequently (ensuring diversity), thereby well balancing between quality and diversity.  Experiments on Slimpajama and FineWeb over 7B large language models demonstrate that $\texttt{Quad}$ significantly outperforms other data selection methods with a low FLOPs consumption. Further analysis also validates the effectiveness of our influence calculation."
Poster,Harnessing Webpage UIs for Text-Rich Visual Understanding,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30176,"Junpeng Liu, Tianyue Ou, Yifan Song, Yuxiao Qu, Wai Lam, Chenyan Xiong, Wenhu Chen, Graham Neubig, Xiang Yue","Text-rich visual understanding—the ability to interpret both textual content and visual elements within a scene—is crucial for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively interact with structured environments. We propose leveraging webpage UIs as a naturally structured and diverse data source to enhance MLLMs’ capabilities in this area. Existing approaches, such as rule-based extraction, multimodal model captioning, and rigid HTML parsing, are hindered by issues like noise, hallucinations, and limited generalization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MultiUI, a dataset of 7.3 million samples spanning various UI types and tasks, structured using enhanced accessibility trees and task taxonomies. By scaling multimodal instructions from web UIs through LLMs, our dataset enhances generalization beyond web domains, significantly improving performance in document understanding, GUI comprehension, grounding, and advanced agent tasks. This demonstrates the potential of structured web data to elevate MLLMs’ proficiency in processing text-rich visual environments and generalizing across domains."
Poster,HART: Efficient Visual Generation with Hybrid Autoregressive Transformer,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/32057,"Haotian Tang, Yecheng Wu, Shang Yang, Enze Xie, Junsong Chen, Junyu Chen, Zhuoyang Zhang, Han Cai, Yao Lu, Song Han","We introduce Hybrid Autoregressive Transformer (HART), the first autoregressive (AR) visual generation model capable of directly generating 1024x1024 images, rivaling diffusion models in image generation quality. Existing AR models face limitations due to the poor image reconstruction quality of their discrete tokenizers and the prohibitive training costs associated with generating 1024px images. To address these challenges, we present the hybrid tokenizer, which decomposes the continuous latents from the autoencoder into two components:  discrete tokens representing the big picture and continuous tokens representing the residual components that cannot be represented by the discrete tokens. The discrete component is modeled by a scalable-resolution discrete AR model, while the continuous component is learned with a lightweight residual diffusion module with only 37M parameters. Compared with the discrete-only VAR tokenizer, our hybrid approach improves reconstruction FID from 2.11 to 0.30 on MJHQ-30K, leading to a 31% generation FID improvement from 7.85 to 5.38. HART also outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models in both FID and CLIP score, with 4.5-7.7$\times$ higher throughput and 6.9-13.4$\times$ lower MACs.

Poster,HASARD: A Benchmark for Vision-Based Safe Reinforcement Learning in Embodied Agents,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30963,"Tristan Tomilin, Meng Fang, Mykola Pechenizkiy","Advancing safe autonomous systems through reinforcement learning (RL) requires robust benchmarks to evaluate performance, analyze methods, and assess agent competencies. Humans primarily rely on embodied visual perception to safely navigate and interact with their surroundings, making it a valuable capability for RL agents. However, existing vision-based 3D benchmarks only consider simple navigation tasks. To address this shortcoming, we introduce **HASARD**, a suite of diverse and complex tasks to **HA**rness **SA**fe **R**L with **D**oom, requiring strategic decision-making, comprehending spatial relationships, and predicting the short-term future. HASARD features three difficulty levels and two action spaces. An empirical evaluation of popular baseline methods demonstrates the benchmark's complexity, unique challenges, and reward-cost trade-offs. Visualizing agent navigation during training with top-down heatmaps provides insight into a method's learning process. Incrementally training across difficulty levels offers an implicit learning curriculum. HASARD is the first safe RL benchmark to exclusively target egocentric vision-based learning, offering a cost-effective and insightful way to explore the potential and boundaries of current and future safe RL methods. The environments and baseline implementations are open-sourced."
Poster,Has the Deep Neural Network learned the Stochastic Process? An Evaluation Viewpoint,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31133,"Harshit Kumar, Beomseok Kang, Biswadeep Chakraborty, Saibal Mukhopadhyay","This paper presents the first systematic study of evaluating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) designed to forecast the evolution of stochastic complex systems. We show that traditional evaluation methods like threshold-based classification metrics and error-based scoring rules assess a DNN's ability to replicate the observed ground truth but fail to measure the DNN's learning of the underlying stochastic process. To address this gap, we propose a new evaluation criteria called _Fidelity to Stochastic Process (F2SP)_, representing the DNN's ability to predict the system property _Statistic-GT_—the ground truth of the stochastic process—and introduce an evaluation metric that exclusively assesses F2SP. We formalize F2SP within a stochastic framework and establish criteria for validly measuring it. We formally show that Expected Calibration Error (ECE) satisfies the necessary condition for testing F2SP, unlike traditional evaluation methods. Empirical experiments on synthetic datasets, including wildfire, host-pathogen, and stock market models, demonstrate that ECE uniquely captures F2SP. We further extend our study to real-world wildfire data, highlighting the limitations of conventional evaluation and discuss the practical utility of incorporating F2SP into model assessment. This work offers a new perspective on evaluating DNNs modeling complex systems by emphasizing the importance of capturing underlying the stochastic process."
Poster,Have the VLMs Lost Confidence? A Study of Sycophancy in VLMs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30427,"Shuo Li, Tao Ji, Xiaoran Fan, Linsheng Lu, Leyi Yang, Yuming Yang, Zhiheng Xi, Rui Zheng, Yuran Wang, xh.zhao, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang","In the study of LLMs, sycophancy represents a prevalent hallucination that poses significant challenges to these models. Specifically, LLMs often fail to adhere to original correct responses, instead blindly agreeing with users' opinions, even when those opinions are incorrect or malicious. However, research on sycophancy in visual language models (VLMs) has been scarce. In this work, we extend the exploration of sycophancy from LLMs to VLMs, introducing the MM-SY benchmark to evaluate this phenomenon. We present evaluation results from multiple representative models, addressing the gap in sycophancy research for VLMs. To mitigate sycophancy, we propose a synthetic dataset for training and employ methods based on prompts, supervised fine-tuning, and DPO. Our experiments demonstrate that these methods effectively alleviate sycophancy in VLMs. Additionally, we probe VLMs to assess the semantic impact of sycophancy and analyze the attention distribution of visual tokens. Our findings indicate that the ability to prevent sycophancy is predominantly observed in higher layers of the model. The lack of attention to image knowledge in these higher layers may contribute to sycophancy, and enhancing image attention at high layers proves beneficial in mitigating this issue."
Poster,HD-Painter: High-Resolution and Prompt-Faithful Text-Guided Image Inpainting with Diffusion Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30867,"Hayk Manukyan, Andranik Sargsyan, Barsegh Atanyan, Zhangyang Wang, Shant Navasardyan, Humphrey Shi","Recent progress in text-guided image inpainting, based on the unprecedented success of text-to-image diffusion models, has led to exceptionally realistic and visually plausible results. However, there is still significant potential for improvement in current text-to-image inpainting models, particularly in better aligning the inpainted area with user prompts. Therefore, we introduce $\textit{HD-Painter}$, a $\textbf{training-free}$ approach that $\textbf{accurately follows prompts}$. To this end, we design the $\textit{Prompt-Aware Introverted Attention (PAIntA)}$ layer enhancing self-attention scores by prompt information resulting in better text aligned generations. To further improve the prompt coherence we introduce the $\textit{Reweighting Attention Score Guidance (RASG)}$ mechanism seamlessly integrating a post-hoc sampling strategy into the general form of DDIM to prevent out-of-distribution latent shifts. Our experiments demonstrate that HD-Painter surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and qualitatively across multiple metrics and a user study.

Poster,HeadMap: Locating and Enhancing Knowledge Circuits in LLMs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28637,"Xuehao Wang, Liyuan Wang, Binghuai Lin, Yu Zhang","Large language models (LLMs), through pretraining on extensive corpora, encompass rich semantic knowledge and exhibit the potential for efficient adaptation to diverse downstream tasks. However, the intrinsic mechanisms underlying LLMs remain unexplored, limiting the efficacy of applying these models to downstream tasks. In this paper, we explore the intrinsic mechanisms of LLMs from the perspective of knowledge circuits. Specifically, considering layer dependencies, we propose a layer-conditioned locating algorithm to identify a series of attention heads, which is a knowledge circuit of some tasks. Experiments demonstrate that simply masking a small portion of attention heads in the knowledge circuit can significantly reduce the model's ability to make correct predictions. This suggests that the knowledge flow within the knowledge circuit plays a critical role when the model makes a correct prediction. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method called HeadMap, which maps the activations of these critical heads in the located knowledge circuit to the residual stream by two linear layers, thus enhancing knowledge flow from the knowledge circuit in the residual stream. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse datasets demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/XuehaoWangFi/HeadMap."
Poster,Heavy-Tailed Diffusion Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28024,"Kushagra Pandey, Jaideep Pathak, Yilun Xu, Stephan Mandt, Michael Pritchard, Arash Vahdat, Morteza Mardani","Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art generation quality across many applications, but their ability to capture rare or extreme events in heavy-tailed distributions remains unclear. In this work, we show that traditional diffusion and flow-matching models with standard Gaussian priors fail to capture heavy-tailed behavior. We address this by repurposing the diffusion framework for heavy-tail estimation using multivariate Student-t distributions. We develop a tailored perturbation kernel and derive the denoising posterior based on the conditional Student-t distribution for the backward process. Inspired by $\gamma$-divergence for heavy-tailed distributions, we derive a training objective for heavy-tailed denoisers. The resulting framework introduces controllable tail generation using only a single scalar hyperparameter, making it easily tunable for diverse real-world distributions. As specific instantiations of our framework, we introduce t-EDM and t-Flow, extensions of existing diffusion and flow models that employ a Student-t prior. Remarkably, our approach is readily compatible with standard Gaussian diffusion models and requires only minimal code changes. Empirically, we show that our t-EDM and t-Flow outperform standard diffusion models in heavy-tail estimation on high-resolution weather datasets in which generating rare and extreme events is crucial."
Poster,HELMET: How to Evaluate Long-context Models Effectively and Thoroughly,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31157,"Howard Yen, Tianyu Gao, Minmin Hou, Ke Ding, Daniel Fleischer, Peter Izsak, Moshe Wasserblat, Danqi Chen","Many benchmarks exist for evaluating long-context language models (LCLMs), yet developers often rely on synthetic tasks such as needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) or an arbitrary subset of tasks. However, it remains unclear whether these benchmarks reflect the diverse downstream applications of LCLMs, and such inconsistencies further complicate model comparison. We investigate the underlying reasons behind these practices and find that existing benchmarks often provide noisy signals due to limited coverage of applications, insufficient context lengths, unreliable metrics, and incompatibility with base models. In this work, we introduce HELMET (How to Evaluate Long-context Models Effectively and Thoroughly), a comprehensive benchmark encompassing seven diverse, application-centric categories. We also address several issues in previous benchmarks by adding controllable lengths up to 128K tokens, model-based evaluation for reliable metrics, and few-shot prompting for robustly evaluating base models. Consequently, we demonstrate that HELMET offers more reliable and consistent rankings of frontier LCLMs. Through a comprehensive study of 59 LCLMs, we find that (1) synthetic tasks like NIAH do not reliably predict downstream performance; (2) the diverse categories in HELMET exhibit distinct trends and low correlations with each other; and (3) while most LCLMs achieve perfect NIAH scores, open-source models significantly lag behind closed ones when tasks require full-context reasoning or following complex instructions---the gap widens as length increases. Finally, we recommend using our RAG tasks for fast model development, as they are easy to run and better predict other downstream performance; ultimately, we advocate for a holistic evaluation across diverse tasks."
