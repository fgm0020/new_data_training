Poster,MeToken: Uniform Micro-environment Token Boosts Post-Translational Modification Prediction,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28395,"Cheng Tan, Zhenxiao Cao, Zhangyang Gao, Lirong Wu, Siyuan Li, Yufei Huang, Jun Xia, Bozhen Hu, Stan Z Li","Post-translational modifications (PTMs) profoundly expand the complexity and functionality of the proteome, regulating protein attributes and interactions that are crucial for biological processes. Accurately predicting PTM sites and their specific types is therefore essential for elucidating protein function and understanding disease mechanisms. Existing computational approaches predominantly focus on protein sequences to predict PTM sites, driven by the recognition of sequence-dependent motifs. However, these approaches often overlook protein structural contexts. In this work, we first compile a large-scale sequence-structure PTM dataset, which serves as the foundation for fair comparison. We introduce the MeToken model, which tokenizes the micro-environment of each amino acid, integrating both sequence and structural information into unified discrete tokens. This model not only captures the typical sequence motifs associated with PTMs but also leverages the spatial arrangements dictated by protein tertiary structures, thus providing a holistic view of the factors influencing PTM sites. Designed to address the long-tail distribution of PTM types, MeToken employs uniform sub-codebooks that ensure even the rarest PTMs are adequately represented and distinguished. We validate the effectiveness and generalizability of MeToken across multiple datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in accurately identifying PTM types. The results underscore the importance of incorporating structural data and highlight MeToken's potential in facilitating accurate and comprehensive PTM predictions, which could significantly impact proteomics research."
Poster,Metric-Driven Attributions for Vision Transformers,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28207,"Chase Walker, Sumit Jha, Rickard Ewetz","Attribution algorithms explain computer vision models by attributing the model response to pixels within the input. Existing attribution methods generate explanations by combining transformations of internal model representations such as class activation maps, gradients, attention, or relevance scores. The effectiveness of an attribution map is measured using attribution quality metrics. This leads us to pose the following question: if attribution methods are assessed using attribution quality metrics, why are the metrics not used to generate the attributions? In response to this question, we propose a Metric-Driven Attribution for explaining Vision Transformers (ViT) called MDA. Guided by attribution quality metrics, the method creates attribution maps by performing patch order and patch magnitude optimization across all patch tokens. The first step orders the patches in terms of importance and the second step assigns the magnitude to each patch while preserving the patch order. Moreover, MDA can provide a smooth trade-off between sparse and dense attributions by modifying the optimization objective. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the proposed MDA method outperforms $7$ existing ViT attribution methods by an average of $12\%$ across $12$ attribution metrics on the ImageNet dataset for the ViT-base $16 \times 16$, ViT-tiny $16 \times 16$, and ViT-base $32 \times 32$ models.

Poster,MGCFNN: A Neural MultiGrid Solver with Novel Fourier Neural Network for High Wave Number Helmholtz Equations,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29525,"Yan Xie, Minrui Lv, Chen-Song Zhang","Solving high wavenumber Helmholtz equations is notoriously challenging. Traditional solvers have yet to yield satisfactory results, and most neural network methods struggle to accurately solve cases with extremely high wavenumbers within heterogeneous media. This paper presents an advanced multigrid-hierarchical AI solver, tailored specifically for high wavenumber Helmholtz equations. We adapt the MGCNN architecture to align with the problem setting and incorporate a novel Fourier neural network (FNN) to match the characteristics of Helmholtz equations. FNN, mathematically akin to the convolutional neural network (CNN), enables faster propagation of source influence during the solve phase, making it particularly suitable for handling large size, high wavenumber problems. We conduct supervised learning tests against numerous neural operator learning methods to demonstrate the superior learning capabilities of our solvers. Additionally, we perform scalability tests using an unsupervised strategy to highlight our solvers' significant speedup over the most recent specialized AI solver and AI-enhanced traditional solver for high wavenumber Helmholtz equations. We also carry out an ablation study to underscore the effectiveness of the multigrid hierarchy and the benefits of introducing FNN. Notably, our solvers exhibit optimal convergence of $\mathcal{O}(k)$ up to $k \approx 2000$."
Poster,"MGDA Converges under Generalized Smoothness, Provably",https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27830,"Qi Zhang, Peiyao Xiao, Shaofeng Zou, Kaiyi Ji","Multi-objective optimization (MOO) is receiving more attention in various fields such as multi-task learning. Recent works provide some effective algorithms with theoretical analysis but they are limited by the standard $L$-smooth or bounded-gradient assumptions, which typically do not hold for neural networks, such as Long short-term memory (LSTM) models and Transformers. In this paper, we study a more general and realistic class of generalized $\ell$-smooth loss functions, where $\ell$ is a general non-decreasing function of gradient norm. We revisit and analyze the fundamental multiple gradient descent algorithm (MGDA) and its stochastic version with double sampling for solving the generalized $\ell$-smooth MOO problems,  which approximate the conflict-avoidant (CA) direction that maximizes the minimum improvement among objectives. We provide a comprehensive convergence analysis of these algorithms and show that they converge to an $\epsilon$-accurate Pareto stationary point with a guaranteed $\epsilon$-level average CA distance (i.e., the gap between the updating direction and the CA direction) over all iterations,  where totally $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ and $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ samples are needed for deterministic and stochastic settings, respectively.  We prove that they can also guarantee a tighter $\epsilon$-level CA distance in each iteration using more samples. Moreover, we analyze an efficient variant of MGDA named MGDA-FA using only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time and space, while achieving the same performance guarantee as MGDA."
Poster,MGMapNet: Multi-Granularity Representation Learning for End-to-End Vectorized HD Map Construction,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30420,"Jing Yang, Minyue Jiang, Sen Yang, Xiao Tan, Yingying Li, Errui Ding, Jingdong Wang, Hanli Wang","The construction of vectorized high-definition map typically requires capturing both category and geometry information of map elements. Current state-of-the-art methods often adopt solely either point-level or instance-level representation, overlooking the strong intrinsic relationship between points and instances. In this work, we propose a simple yet efficient framework named MGMapNet (multi-granularity map network) to model map elements with multi-granularity representation, integrating both coarse-grained instance-level and fine-grained point-level queries. Specifically, these two granularities of queries are generated from the multi-scale bird's eye view features using a proposed multi-granularity aggregator. In this module, instance-level query aggregates features over the entire scope covered by an instance, and the point-level query aggregates features locally. Furthermore, a point-instance interaction module is designed to encourage information exchange between instance-level and point-level queries. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MGMapNet achieves state-of-the-art performances, surpassing MapTRv2 by 5.3 mAP on the nuScenes dataset and 4.4 mAP on the Argoverse2 dataset, respectively."
Poster,MIA-Bench: Towards Better Instruction Following Evaluation of Multimodal LLMs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30836,"Yusu Qian, Hanrong Ye, Jean-Philippe Fauconnier, Peter Grasch, Yinfei Yang, Zhe Gan","Effective evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for understanding their capabilities and limitations. In this paper, we introduce MIA-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess MLLMs’ ability to strictly adhere to complex instructions. Our benchmark comprises a diverse set of 400 image-prompt pairs, each crafted to challenge the models’ compliance with layered instructions in generating accurate and contextually appropriate responses. Evaluation results from a wide array of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant variations in performance, highlighting areas for improvement in instruction fidelity. Additionally, we create extra training data and explore supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization to enhance the models’ ability to strictly follow instructions without compromising performance on other tasks. We hope this benchmark not only serves as a tool for measuring MLLM adherence to instructions, but also guides future developments in MLLM training methods."
Poster,MIA-DPO: Multi-Image Augmented Direct Preference Optimization For Large Vision-Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28892,"Ziyu Liu, Yuhang Zang, Xiaoyi Dong, Pan Zhang, Yuhang Cao, Haodong Duan, Conghui He, Yuanjun Xiong, Dahua Lin, Jiaqi Wang","Visual preference alignment involves training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to predict human preferences between visual inputs. This is typically achieved by using labeled datasets of chosen/rejected pairs and employing optimization algorithms like direct preference optimization (DPO).Existing visual alignment methods, primarily designed for single-image scenarios, struggle to effectively handle the complexity of multi-image tasks due to the scarcity of diverse training data and the high cost of annotating chosen/rejected pairs.We present Multi-Image Augmented Direct Preference Optimization (MIA-DPO), a visual preference alignment approach that effectively handles multi-image inputs.MIA-DPO mitigates the scarcity of diverse multi-image training data by extending single-image data with unrelated images arranged in grid collages or pic-in-pic formats, significantly reducing the costs associated with multi-image data annotations.Our observation reveals that attention values of LVLMs vary considerably across different images. We use attention values to identify and filter out rejected responses the model may have mistakenly focused on.Our attention-aware selection for constructing the chosen/rejected pairs without relying on (i) human annotation, (ii) extra data, and (iii) external models or APIs.MIA-DPO is compatible with various architectures and outperforms existing methods on five multi-image benchmarks, achieving an average performance boost of 3.0% on LLaVA-v1.5 and 4.3% on the recent InternLM-XC2.5.Moreover, MIA-DPO has a minimal effect on the model's ability to understand single images."
Poster,Microcanonical Langevin Ensembles: Advancing the Sampling of Bayesian Neural Networks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29695,"Emanuel Sommer, Jakob Robnik, Giorgi Nozadze, Uros Seljak, David Rügamer","Despite recent advances, sampling-based inference for Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) remains a significant challenge in probabilistic deep learning. While sampling-based approaches do not require a variational distribution assumption, current state-of-the-art samplers still struggle to navigate the complex and highly multimodal posteriors of BNNs. As a consequence, sampling still requires considerably longer inference times than non-Bayesian methods even for small neural networks, despite recent advances in making software implementations more efficient. Besides the difficulty of finding high-probability regions, the time until samplers provide sufficient exploration of these areas remains unpredictable. To tackle these challenges, we introduce an ensembling approach that leverages strategies from optimization and a recently proposed sampler called Microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo (MCLMC) for efficient, robust and predictable sampling performance. Compared to approaches based on the state-of-the-art No-U-Turn Sampler, our approach delivers substantial speedups up to an order of magnitude, while maintaining or improving predictive performance and uncertainty quantification across diverse tasks and data modalities. The suggested Microcanonical Langevin Ensembles and modifications to MCLMC additionally enhance the method's predictability in resource requirements, facilitating easier parallelization. All in all, the proposed method offers a promising direction for practical, scalable inference for BNNs."
Poster,MIM-Refiner: A Contrastive Learning Boost from Intermediate Pre-Trained Masked Image Modeling Representations,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31256,"Benedikt Alkin, Lukas Miklautz, Sepp Hochreiter, Johannes Brandstetter","We introduce MIM (Masked Image Modeling)-Refiner, a contrastive learning boost for pre-trained MIM models. MIM-Refiner is motivated by the insight that strong representations within MIM models generally reside in intermediate layers. Accordingly, MIM-Refiner leverages multiple instance discrimination (ID) heads that are connected to different intermediate layers. In each head, a nearest neighbor ID objective constructs clusters that capture semantic information which improves performance on downstream tasks, including off-the-shelf and fine-tuning settings.The refinement process is short and simple -  yet highly effective. Within a few epochs, we refine the features of MIM models from subpar to state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf features. Refining a ViT-H, pre-trained with data2vec 2.0 on ImageNet-1K, sets a new state-of-the-art in linear probing (84.7\%) and low-shot classification among models that are pre-trained on ImageNet-1K. MIM-Refiner efficiently combines the advantages of MIM and ID objectives, enabling scaling ID objectives to billion parameter models using relatively little compute. MIM-Refiner compares favorably against previous state-of-the-art SSL models on various benchmarks such as low-shot classification, long-tailed classification and semantic segmentation."
Poster,Mind Control through Causal Inference: Predicting Clean Images from Poisoned Data,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28743,"Mengxuan Hu, Zihan Guan, Yi Zeng, Junfeng Guo, Zhongliang Zhou, Jielu Zhang, Ruoxi Jia, Anil Vullikanti, Sheng Li","Anti-backdoor learning, aiming to train clean models directly from poisoned datasets, serves as an important defense method for backdoor attack. However, existing methods usually fail to recover backdoored samples to their original, correct labels and suffer from poor generalization to large pre-trained models due to its non end-to end training, making them unsuitable for protecting the increasingly prevalent large pre-trained models. To bridge the gap, we first revisit the anti-backdoor learning problem from a causal perspective. Our theoretical causal analysis reveals that incorporating \emph{\textbf{both}} images and the associated attack indicators preserves the model's integrity. Building on the theoretical analysis, we introduce an end-to-end method, Mind Control through Causal Inference (MCCI), to train clean models directly from poisoned datasets. This approach leverages both the image and the attack indicator to train the model. Based on this training paradigm, the model’s perception of whether an input is clean or backdoored can be controlled. Typically, by introducing fake non-attack indicators, the model perceives all inputs as clean and makes correct predictions, even for poisoned samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, efficiently recovering the original correct predictions for poisoned samples and enhancing accuracy on clean samples."
