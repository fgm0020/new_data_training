Poster,SRSA: Skill Retrieval and Adaptation for Robotic Assembly Tasks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29656,"Yijie Guo, Bingjie Tang, Iretiayo Akinola, Dieter Fox, Abhishek Gupta, Yashraj Narang","Enabling robots to learn novel tasks in a data-efficient manner is a long-standing challenge. Common strategies involve carefully leveraging prior experiences, especially transition data collected on related tasks. Although much progress has been made for general pick-and-place manipulation, far fewer studies have investigated contact-rich assembly tasks, where precise control is essential. We introduce SRSA} (Skill Retrieval and Skill Adaptation), a novel framework designed to address this problem by utilizing a pre-existing skill library containing policies for diverse assembly tasks. The challenge lies in identifying which skill from the library is most relevant for fine-tuning on a new task. Our key hypothesis is that skills showing higher zero-shot success rates on a new task are better suited for rapid and effective fine-tuning on that task. To this end, we propose to predict the transfer success for all skills in the skill library on a novel task, and then use this prediction to guide the skill retrieval process. We establish a framework that jointly captures features of object geometry, physical dynamics, and expert actions to represent the tasks, allowing us to efficiently learn the transfer success predictor. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRSA significantly outperforms the leading baseline. When retrieving and fine-tuning skills on unseen tasks, SRSA achieves a 19% relative improvement in success rate, exhibits 2.6x lower standard deviation across random seeds, and requires 2.4x fewer transition samples to reach a satisfactory success rate, compared to the baseline. In a continual learning setup, SRSA efficiently learns policies for new tasks and incorporates them into the skill library, enhancing future policy learning. Furthermore, policies trained with SRSA in simulation achieve a 90% mean success rate when deployed in the real world. Please visit our project webpage https://srsa2024.github.io/."
Poster,SSLAM: Enhancing Self-Supervised Models with Audio Mixtures for Polyphonic Soundscapes,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28347,"Tony Alex, Sara Atito, Armin Mustafa, Muhammad Awais, Philip Jackson","Self-supervised pre-trained audio networks have seen widespread adoption in real-world systems, particularly in multi-modal large language models. These networks are often employed in a frozen state, under the assumption that the self-supervised pre-training has sufficiently equipped them to handle real-world audio. However, a critical question remains: how well do these models actually perform in real-world conditions, where audio is typically polyphonic and complex, involving multiple overlapping sound sources? Current audio self-supervised learning (SSL) methods are often benchmarked on datasets predominantly featuring monophonic audio, such as environmental sounds, and speech. As a result, the ability of SSL models to generalize to polyphonic audio, a common characteristic in natural scenarios, remains underexplored. This limitation raises concerns about the practical robustness of SSL models in more realistic audio settings. To address this gap, we introduce Self-Supervised Learning from Audio Mixtures (SSLAM), a novel direction in audio SSL research,  designed to improve the model’s ability to learn from polyphonic data while maintaining strong performance on monophonic data. We thoroughly evaluate SSLAM on standard audio SSL benchmark datasets which are predominantly monophonic and conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods using a range of high-quality, publicly available polyphonic datasets. SSLAM not only improves model performance on polyphonic audio, but also maintains or exceeds performance on standard audio SSL benchmarks. Notably, it achieves up to a 3.9% improvement on the AudioSet-2M(AS-2M), reaching a mean average precision (mAP) of 50.2. For polyphonic datasets, SSLAM sets new SOTA in both linear evaluation and fine-tuning regimes with performance improvements of up to 9.1%(mAP). These results demonstrate SSLAM's effectiveness in both polyphonic and monophonic soundscapes, significantly enhancing the performance of audio SSL models.

Poster,SSOLE: Rethinking Orthogonal Low-rank Embedding for Self-Supervised Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27685,"Lun Huang, Qiang Qiu, Guillermo Sapiro","Self-supervised learning (SSL) aims to learn meaningful representations from unlabeled data. Orthogonal Low-rank Embedding (OLE) shows promise for SSL by enhancing intra-class similarity in a low-rank subspace and promoting inter-class dissimilarity in a high-rank subspace, making it particularly suitable for multi-view learning tasks. However, directly applying OLE to SSL poses significant challenges: (1) the virtually infinite number of ""classes"" in SSL makes achieving the OLE objective impractical, leading to representational collapse; and (2) low-rank constraints may fail to distinguish between positively and negatively correlated features, further undermining learning. To address these issues, we propose SSOLE (Self-Supervised Orthogonal Low-rank Embedding), a novel framework that integrates OLE principles into SSL by (1) decoupling the low-rank and high-rank enforcement to align with SSL objectives; and (2) applying low-rank constraints to feature deviations from their mean, ensuring better alignment of positive pairs by accounting for the signs of cosine similarities. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that these adaptations are crucial to SSOLE’s effectiveness. Moreover, SSOLE achieves competitive performance across SSL benchmarks without relying on large batch sizes, memory banks, or dual-encoder architectures, making it an efficient and scalable solution for self-supervised tasks.

Poster,Stabilized Neural Prediction of Potential Outcomes in Continuous Time,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29172,"Konstantin Hess, Stefan Feuerriegel","Patient trajectories from electronic health records are widely used to estimate conditional average potential outcomes (CAPOs) of treatments over time, which then allows to personalize care. Yet, existing neural methods for this purpose have a key limitation: while some adjust for time-varying confounding, these methods assume that the time series are recorded in discrete time. In other words, they are constrained to settings where measurements and treatments are conducted at fixed time steps, even though this is unrealistic in medical practice. In this work, we aim to estimate CAPOs in continuous time. The latter is of direct practical relevance because it allows for modeling patient trajectories where measurements and treatments take place at arbitrary, irregular timestamps. We thus propose a new method called stabilized continuous time inverse propensity network (SCIP-Net). For this, we further derive stabilized inverse propensity weights for robust estimation of the CAPOs. To the best of our knowledge, our SCIP-Net is the first neural method that performs proper adjustments for time-varying confounding in continuous time."
Poster,Stabilizing Reinforcement Learning in Differentiable Multiphysics Simulation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30460,"Eliot Xing, Vernon Luk, Jean Oh","Recent advances in GPU-based parallel simulation have enabled practitioners to collect large amounts of data and train complex control policies using deep reinforcement learning (RL), on commodity GPUs. However, such successes for RL in robotics have been limited to tasks sufficiently simulated by fast rigid-body dynamics. Simulation techniques for soft bodies are comparatively several orders of magnitude slower, thereby limiting the use of RL due to sample complexity requirements. To address this challenge, this paper presents both a novel RL algorithm and a simulation platform to enable scaling RL on tasks involving rigid bodies and deformables. We introduce Soft Analytic Policy Optimization (SAPO), a maximum entropy first-order model-based actor-critic RL algorithm, which uses first-order analytic gradients from differentiable simulation to train a stochastic actor to maximize expected return and entropy. Alongside our approach, we develop Rewarped, a parallel differentiable multiphysics simulation platform that supports simulating various materials beyond rigid bodies. We re-implement challenging manipulation and locomotion tasks in Rewarped, and show that SAPO outperforms baselines over a range of tasks that involve interaction between rigid bodies, articulations, and deformables.

Poster,Stable Hadamard Memory: Revitalizing Memory-Augmented Agents for Reinforcement Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29355,"Hung Le, Dung Nguyen, Kien Do, Sunil Gupta, Svetha Venkatesh","Effective decision-making in partially observable environments demands robust memory management. Despite their success in supervised learning, current deep-learning memory models struggle in reinforcement learning environments that are partially observable and long-term. They fail to efficiently capture relevant past information, adapt flexibly to changing observations, and maintain stable updates over long episodes. We theoretically analyze the limitations of existing memory models within a unified framework and introduce the Stable Hadamard Memory, a novel memory model for reinforcement learning agents. Our model dynamically adjusts memory by erasing no longer needed experiences and reinforcing crucial ones computationally efficiently. To this end, we leverage the Hadamard product for calibrating and updating memory, specifically designed to enhance memory capacity while mitigating numerical and learning challenges. Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art memory-based methods on challenging partially observable benchmarks, such as meta-reinforcement learning, long-horizon credit assignment, and POPGym, demonstrating superior performance in handling long-term and evolving contexts."
Poster,Stable Segment Anything Model,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28332,"Qi Fan, Xin Tao, Lei Ke, Mingqiao Ye, Di ZHANG, Pengfei Wan, Yu-Wing Tai, Chi-Keung Tang","The Segment Anything Model (SAM) achieves remarkable promptable segmentation given high-quality prompts which, however, often require good skills to specify. To make SAM robust to casual prompts, this paper presents the first comprehensive analysis on SAM’s segmentation stability across a diverse spectrum of prompt qualities, notably imprecise bounding boxes and insufficient points. Our key finding reveals that given such low-quality prompts, SAM’s mask decoder tends to activate image features that are biased towards the background or confined to specific object parts. To mitigate this issue, our key idea consists of calibrating solely SAM’s mask attention by adjusting the sampling locations and amplitudes of image features, while the original SAM model architecture and weights remain unchanged. Consequently, our deformable sampling plugin (DSP) enables SAM to adaptively shift attention to the prompted target regions in a data-driven manner. During inference, dynamic routing plugin (DRP) is proposed that toggles SAM between the deformable and regular grid sampling modes, conditioned on the input prompt quality. Thus, our solution, termed Stable-SAM, offers several advantages: 1) improved SAM’s segmentation stability across a wide range of prompt qualities, while 2) retaining SAM’s powerful promptable segmentation efficiency and generality, with 3) minimal learnable parameters (0.08 M) and fast adaptation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and advantages of our approach, underscoring Stable-SAM as a more robust solution for segmenting anything.

Poster,STAFF: Speculative Coreset Selection for Task-Specific Fine-tuning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30360,"Xiaoyu Zhang, Juan Zhai, Shiqing Ma, Chao Shen, Tianlin Li, Weipeng Jiang, Yang Liu","Task-specific fine-tuning is essential for the deployment of large language models (LLMs), but it requires significant computational resources and time. Existing solutions have proposed coreset selection methods to improve data efficiency and reduce model training overhead, but they still have limitations: ❶ Overlooking valuable samples at high pruning rates, which degrades the coreset’s performance.❷ Requiring high time overhead during coreset selection to fine-tune and evaluate the target LLM. In this paper, we introduce STAFF, a speculative coreset selection method. STAFF leverages a small model from the same family as the target LLM to efficiently estimate data scores and then verifies the scores on the target LLM to accurately identify and allocate more selection budget to important regions while maintaining coverage of easy regions. We evaluate STAFF on three LLMs and three downstream tasks and show that STAFF improves the performance of SOTA methods by up to 54.3% and reduces selection overhead by up to 70.5% at different pruning rates. Furthermore, we observe that the coreset selected by STAFF at low pruning rates (i.e., 20%) can even obtain better fine-tuning performance than the full dataset."
Poster,STAMP: Scalable Task- And Model-agnostic Collaborative Perception,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30771,"Xiangbo Gao, Runsheng Xu, Jiachen Li, Ziran Wang, Zhiwen Fan, Zhengzhong Tu","Perception is a crucial component of autonomous driving systems. However, single-agent setups often face limitations due to sensor constraints, especially under challenging conditions like severe occlusion, adverse weather, and long-range object detection. Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) offers a promising solution that enables communication and information sharing between connected vehicles. Yet, the heterogeneity among agents—in terms of sensors, models, and tasks—significantly hinders effective and efficient cross-agent collaboration. To address these challenges, we propose STAMP, a scalable task- and model-agnostic collaborative perception framework tailored for heterogeneous agents. STAMP utilizes lightweight adapter-reverter pairs to transform Bird's Eye View (BEV) features between agent-specific domains and a shared protocol domain, facilitating efficient feature sharing and fusion while minimizing computational overhead. Moreover, our approach enhances scalability, preserves model security, and accommodates a diverse range of agents. Extensive experiments on both simulated (OPV2V) and real-world (V2V4Real) datasets demonstrate that STAMP achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art models with significantly reduced computational costs. As the first-of-its-kind task- and model-agnostic collaborative perception framework, STAMP aims to advance research in scalable and secure mobility systems, bringing us closer to Level 5 autonomy.

Poster,Standard Gaussian Process is All You Need for High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28574,"Zhitong Xu, Haitao Wang, Jeff Phillips, Shandian Zhe","A long-standing belief holds that Bayesian Optimization (BO) with standard Gaussian processes (GP) --- referred to as standard BO --- underperforms in high-dimensional optimization problems. While this belief seems plausible, it lacks both robust empirical evidence and theoretical justification. To address this gap, we present a systematic investigation. First, through a comprehensive evaluation across twelve benchmarks, we found that while the popular Square Exponential (SE) kernel often leads to poor performance, using Mat\'ern kernels enables standard BO to consistently achieve top-tier results, frequently surpassing methods specifically designed for high-dimensional optimization. Second, our theoretical analysis reveals that the SE kernel’s failure primarily stems from improper initialization of the length-scale parameters, which are commonly used in practice but can cause gradient vanishing in training. We provide a probabilistic bound to characterize this issue, showing that Mat\'ern kernels are less susceptible and can robustly handle much higher dimensions. Third, we propose a simple robust initialization strategy that dramatically improves the performance of the SE kernel, bringing it close to state-of-the-art methods, without requiring additional priors or regularization. We prove another probabilistic bound that demonstrates how the gradient vanishing issue can be effectively mitigated with our method. Our findings advocate for a re-evaluation of standard BO’s potential in high-dimensional settings."
