Poster,NUDGE: Lightweight Non-Parametric Fine-Tuning of Embeddings for Retrieval,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29928,"Sepanta Zeighami, Zac Wellmer, Aditya Parameswaran","$k$-Nearest Neighbor search on dense vector embeddings ($k$-NN retrieval) from pre-trained embedding models is the predominant retrieval method for text and images, as well as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. In practice, application developers often fine-tune the embeddings to improve their accuracy on the dataset and query workload in hand. Existing approaches either fine-tune the pre-trained model itself or, more efficiently, but at the cost of accuracy, train adaptor models to transform the output of the pre-trained model. We present NUDGE, a family of novel *non-parametric* embedding fine-tuning approaches that are significantly more accurate and efficient than both sets of existing approaches. NUDGE directly modifies the embeddings of data records to maximize the accuracy of $k$-NN retrieval. We present a thorough theoretical and experimental study of NUDGE's non-parametric approach. We show that even though the underlying problem is NP-Hard, constrained variations can be solved efficiently. These constraints additionally ensure that the changes to the embeddings are modest, avoiding large distortions to the semantics learned during pre-training. In experiments across five pre-trained models and nine standard text and image retrieval datasets, *NUDGE runs in minutes and often improves NDCG@10 by more than 10\% over existing fine-tuning methods. On average, NUDGE provides 3.3$\times$ and 4.3$\times$ higher increase in accuracy and runs 200$\times$ and 3$\times$ faster, respectively, over fine-tuning the pre-trained model and training adaptors.*"
Poster,Null Counterfactual Factor Interactions for Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31106,"Caleb Chuck, Fan Feng, Carl Qi, Chang Shi, Siddhant Agarwal, Amy Zhang, Scott Niekum","Hindsight relabeling is a powerful tool for overcoming sparsity in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL), especially in certain domains such as navigation and locomotion. However, hindsight relabeling can struggle in object-centric domains. For example, suppose that the goal space consists of a robotic arm pushing a particular target block to a goal location. In this case, hindsight relabeling will give high rewards to any trajectory that does not interact with the block. However, these behaviors are only useful when the object is already at the goal---an extremely rare case in practice. A dataset dominated by these kinds of trajectories can complicate learning and lead to failures. In object-centric domains, one key intuition is that meaningful trajectories are often characterized by object-object interactions such as pushing the block with the gripper. To leverage this intuition, we introduce Hindsight Relabeling using Interactions (HInt), which combines interactions with hindsight relabeling to improve the sample efficiency of downstream RL. However, interactions do not have a consensus statistical definition that is tractable for downstream GCRL. Therefore, we propose a definition of interactions based on the concept of _null counterfactual_: a cause object is interacting with a target object if, in a world where the cause object did not exist, the target object would have different transition dynamics. We leverage this definition to infer interactions in Null Counterfactual Interaction Inference (NCII), which uses a ``nulling'' operation with a learned model to simulate absences and infer interactions. We demonstrate that NCII is able to achieve significantly improved interaction inference accuracy in both simple linear dynamics domains and dynamic robotic domains in Robosuite, Robot Air Hockey, and Franka Kitchen. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HInt improves sample efficiency by up to $4\times$ in these domains as goal-conditioned tasks."
Poster,Number Cookbook: Number Understanding of Language Models and How to Improve It,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30568,"Haotong Yang, Yi Hu, Shijia Kang, Zhouchen Lin, Muhan Zhang","Large language models (LLMs) can solve an increasing number of complex reasoning tasks while making surprising mistakes in basic numerical understanding and processing (such as $9.11 > 9.9$). The latter ability is essential for tackling complex arithmetic and mathematical problems and serves as a foundation for most reasoning tasks, but previous work paid little attention to it or only discussed several restricted tasks (like integer addition). In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the numerical understanding and processing ability (NUPA) of LLMs. Firstly, we introduce a benchmark covering four common numerical representations and 17 distinct numerical tasks in four major categories, resulting in 41 meaningful combinations in total. These tasks are derived from primary and secondary education curricula, encompassing nearly all everyday numerical understanding and processing scenarios, and the rules of these tasks are very simple and clear.Through the benchmark, we find that current LLMs fail frequently in many of the tasks. To study the problem, we train small models with existing and potential techniques for enhancing NUPA (such as tokenizers, PEs, and number formats), comprehensively evaluating their effectiveness using our testbed. We also finetune practical-scale LLMs on our proposed NUPA tasks and find that 1) naive finetuning can improve NUPA a lot on many but not all tasks, and 2) surprisingly, techniques designed to enhance NUPA prove ineffective for finetuning pretrained models. We further explore the impact of chain-of-thought techniques on NUPA. Our work provides a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of NUPA in LLMs."
Poster,NutriBench: A Dataset for Evaluating Large Language Models in Nutrition Estimation from Meal Descriptions,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30896,"Mehak Dhaliwal, Andong Hua, Laya Pullela, Ryan Burke, Yao Qin","Accurate nutrition estimation helps people make informed dietary choices and is essential in the prevention of serious health complications. We present NutriBench, the first publicly available natural language meal description nutrition benchmark. NutriBench consists of 11,857 meal descriptions generated from real-world global dietary intake data. The data is human-verified and annotated with macro-nutrient labels, including carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and calories. We conduct an extensive evaluation of Nutribench on the task of carbohydrate estimation, testing twelve leading Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Llama3.1, Qwen2, Gemma2, and OpenBioLLM models, using standard, Chain-of-Thought and Retrieval-Augmented Generation strategies. Additionally, we present a study involving professional nutritionists, finding that LLMs can provide comparable but significantly faster estimates. Finally, we perform a real-world risk assessment by simulating the effect of carbohydrate predictions on the blood glucose levels of individuals with type 1 diabetes. Our work highlights the opportunities and challenges of using LLMs for nutrition estimation, demonstrating their potential to aid professionals and laypersons and improve health outcomes. Our benchmark is publicly available at: https://mehak126.github.io/nutribench.html"
Poster,NV-Embed: Improved Techniques for Training LLMs as Generalist Embedding Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28505,"Chankyu Lee, Rajarshi Roy, Mengyao Xu, Jonathan Raiman, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro, Wei Ping","Decoder-only large language model (LLM)-based embedding models are beginning to outperform BERT or T5-based embedding models in general-purpose text embedding tasks, including dense vector-based retrieval. In this work, we introduce the NV-Embed model, incorporating architectural designs, training procedures, and curated datasets to significantly enhance the performance of LLM as a versatile embedding model, while maintaining its simplicity and reproducibility.For model architecture, we propose a latent attention layer to obtain pooled embeddings, which consistently improves retrieval and downstream task accuracy compared to mean pooling or using the last <EOS> token embedding from LLMs. To enhance representation learning, we remove the causal attention mask of LLMs during contrastive training. For training algorithm, we introduce a two-stage contrastive instruction-tuning method. It first applies contrastive training with instructions on retrieval datasets, utilizing in-batch negatives and curated hard negative examples. At stage-2, it blends various non-retrieval into instruction tuning, which not only enhances non-retrieval task accuracy but also improves retrieval performance. For training data, we utilize the hard-negative mining, synthetic data generation and existing public available datasets to boost the performance of embedding model. By combining these techniques, our NV-Embed- v1 model secured the No.1 position on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) (as of May 24, 2024), across 56 embedding tasks. NV-Embed-v2 has reclaimed and maintained the top spot on MTEB since August 30, 2024, demonstrating the sustained effectiveness of the proposed methods over time.  Also, it achieved the highest scores in the Long Doc section and the second-highest scores in the QA section of the AIR Benchmark, which covers a range of out-of-domain information retrieval topics beyond those in MTEB.  We further provide the analysis of model compression techniques for generalist embedding models.  We open-source the model at: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NV-Embed-v2 ."
Poster,NVS-Solver: Video Diffusion Model as Zero-Shot Novel View Synthesizer,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27681,"Meng YOU, Zhiyu Zhu, Hui LIU, Junhui Hou","By harnessing the potent generative capabilities of pre-trained large video diffusion models, we propose a new novel view synthesis paradigm that operates without the need for training. The proposed method adaptively modulates the diffusion sampling process with the given views to enable the creation of visually pleasing results from single or multiple views of static scenes or monocular videos of dynamic scenes. Specifically, built upon our theoretical modeling, we iteratively modulate the score function with the given scene priors represented with warped input views to control the video diffusion process. Moreover, by theoretically exploring the boundary of the estimation error, we achieve the modulation in an adaptive fashion according to the view pose and the number of diffusion steps. Extensive evaluations on both static and dynamic scenes substantiate the significant superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Poster,"OASIS Uncovers: High-Quality T2I Models, Same Old Stereotypes",https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/32095,"Sepehr Dehdashtian, Gautam Sreekumar, Vishnu Boddeti","Images generated by text-to-image (T2I) models often exhibit visual biases and stereotypes of concepts such as culture and profession. Existing quantitative measures of stereotypes are based on statistical parity that does not align with the sociological definition of stereotypes and, therefore, incorrectly categorizes biases as stereotypes. Instead of oversimplifying stereotypes as biases, we propose a quantitative measure of stereotypes that aligns with its sociological definition. We then propose OASIS to measure the stereotypes in a generated dataset and understand their origins within the T2I model. OASIS includes two scores to measure stereotypes from a generated image dataset: **(M1)** Stereotype Score to measure the distributional violation of stereotypical attributes, and **(M2)** WALS to measure spectral variance in the images along a stereotypical attribute. OASISalso includes two methods to understand the origins of stereotypes in T2I models: **(U1)** StOP to discover attributes that the T2I model internally associates with a given concept, and **(U2)** SPI to quantify the emergence of stereotypical attributes in the latent space of the T2I model during image generation. Despite the considerable progress in image fidelity, using OASIS, we conclude that newer T2I models such as FLUX.1 and SDv3 contain strong stereotypical predispositions about concepts and still generate images with widespread stereotypical attributes. Additionally, the quantity of stereotypes worsens for nationalities with lower Internet footprints."
Poster,OATS: Outlier-Aware Pruning Through Sparse and Low Rank Decomposition,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30463,"Stephen Zhang, Vardan Papyan","The recent paradigm shift to large-scale foundation models has brought about a new era for deep learning that, while has found great success in practice, has also been plagued by prohibitively expensive costs in terms of high memory consumption and compute. To mitigate these issues, there has been a concerted effort in post-hoc neural network pruning techniques that do not require costly retraining. Despite the considerable progress being made, existing methods often exhibit a steady drop in model performance as the compression increases. In this paper, we present a novel approach to compressing large transformers, coined OATS, that compresses the model weights by approximating each weight matrix as the sum of a sparse matrix and a low-rank matrix. Prior to the decomposition, the weights are first scaled by the second moment of their input embeddings, so as to ensure the preservation of  outlier features recently observed in large transformer models. Without retraining, OATS achieves state-of-the-art performance when compressing large language models, such as Llama-3 and Phi-3, and vision transformers, such as Google's ViT and DINOv2, by up to $60\\%$, all while speeding up the model's inference on a CPU by up to $1.37\times$ compared to prior pruning methods."
Poster,OBI-Bench: Can LMMs Aid in Study of Ancient Script on Oracle Bones?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28769,"Zijian Chen, tingzhu chen, Wenjun Zhang, Guangtao Zhai","We introduce OBI-Bench, a holistic benchmark crafted to systematically evaluate large multi-modal models (LMMs) on whole-process oracle bone inscriptions (OBI) processing tasks demanding expert-level domain knowledge and deliberate cognition. OBI-Bench includes 5,523 meticulously collected diverse-sourced images, covering five key domain problems: recognition, rejoining, classification, retrieval, and deciphering. These images span centuries of archaeological findings and years of research by front-line scholars, comprising multi-stage font appearances from excavation to synthesis, such as original oracle bone, inked rubbings, oracle bone fragments, cropped single characters, and handprinted characters. Unlike existing benchmarks, OBI-Bench focuses on advanced visual perception and reasoning with OBI-specific knowledge, challenging LMMs to perform tasks akin to those faced by experts. The evaluation of 6 proprietary LMMs as well as 17 open-source LMMs highlights the substantial challenges and demands posed by OBI-Bench. Even the latest versions of GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Qwen-VL-Max are still far from public-level humans in some fine-grained perception tasks. However, they perform at a level comparable to untrained humans in deciphering tasks, indicating remarkable capabilities in offering new interpretative perspectives and generating creative guesses. We hope OBI-Bench can facilitate the community to develop domain-specific multi-modal foundation models towards ancient language research and delve deeper to discover and enhance these untapped potentials of LMMs."
Poster,Object-Centric Pretraining via Target Encoder Bootstrapping,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30811,"Nikola Đukić, Tim Lebailly, Tinne Tuytelaars","Object-centric representation learning has recently been successfully applied to real-world datasets. This success can be attributed to pretrained non-object-centric foundation models, whose features serve as reconstruction targets for slot attention. However, targets must remain frozen throughout the training, which sets an upper bound on the performance object-centric models can attain. Attempts to update the target encoder by bootstrapping result in large performance drops, which can be attributed to its lack of object-centric inductive biases, causing the object-centric model’s encoder to drift away from representations useful as reconstruction targets. To address these limitations, we propose **O**bject-**CE**ntric Pretraining by Target Encoder **BO**otstrapping, a self-distillation setup for training object-centric models from scratch, on real-world data, for the first time ever. In OCEBO, the target encoder is updated as an exponential moving average of the object-centric model, thus explicitly being enriched with object-centric inductive biases introduced by slot attention while removing the upper bound on performance present in other models. We mitigate the slot collapse caused by random initialization of the target encoder by introducing a novel cross-view patch filtering approach that limits the supervision to sufficiently informative patches. When pretrained on 241k images from COCO, OCEBO achieves unsupervised object discovery performance comparable to that of object-centric models with frozen non-object-centric target encoders pretrained on hundreds of millions of images. The code and pretrained models are publicly available at https://github.com/djukicn/ocebo."
