Poster,MIND: Math Informed syNthetic Dialogues for Pretraining LLMs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29504,"Syeda Nahida Akter, Shrimai Prabhumoye, John Kamalu, Sanjeev Satheesh, Eric Nyberg, Mostofa Patwary, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro","The utility of synthetic data to enhance pretraining data quality and hence to improve downstream task accuracy has been widely explored in recent large language models (LLMs). Yet, these approaches fall inadequate in complex, multi-hop and mathematical reasoning tasks as the synthetic data typically fails to add complementary knowledge to the existing raw corpus. In this work, we propose a novel large-scale and diverse Math Informed syNthetic Dialogue (MIND) generation method that improves the mathematical reasoning ability of LLMs. Specifically, using MIND, we generate synthetic conversations based on OpenWebMath (OWM), resulting in a new math corpus, MIND-OWM. Our experiments with different conversational settings reveal that incorporating knowledge gaps between dialog participants is essential for generating high-quality math data. We further identify an effective way to format and integrate synthetic and raw data during pretraining to maximize the gain in mathematical reasoning, emphasizing the need to restructure raw data rather than use it as-is. Compared to pretraining just on raw data, a model pretrained on MIND-OWM shows significant boost in mathematical reasoning (GSM8K: +13.42%, MATH: +2.30%), including superior performance in specialized knowledge (MMLU: +4.55%, MMLU-STEM: +4.28%) and generalpurpose reasoning tasks (GENERAL REASONING: +2.51%)."
Poster,MIND over Body: Adaptive Thinking using Dynamic Computation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30390,"Mrinal Mathur, Barak Pearlmutter, Sergey Plis","While the human brain efficiently handles various computations with a limited number of neurons, traditional deep learning networks require a significant increase in parameters to improve performance.  Yet, these parameters are used inefficiently as the networks employ the same amount of computation for inputs of the same size, regardless of the input's complexity.  We address this inefficiency by introducing self-introspection capabilities to the network, enabling it to adjust the number of used parameters based on the internal representation of the task and adapt the computation time based on the task complexity.  This enables the network to adaptively reuse parameters across tasks, dynamically adjusting the computational effort to match the complexity of the input.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on language modeling and computer vision tasks.  Notably, our model achieves 96.62\% accuracy on ImageNet with just a three-layer network, surpassing much larger ResNet-50 and EfficientNet. When applied to a transformer architecture, the approach achieves 95.8\%/88.7\% F1 scores on the SQuAD v1.1/v2.0 datasets at negligible parameter cost.  These results showcase the potential for dynamic and reflective computation, contributing to the creation of intelligent systems that efficiently manage resources based on input data complexity."
Poster,MindSearch: Mimicking Human Minds Elicits Deep AI Searcher,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27772,"Zehui Chen, Kuikun Liu, Qiuchen Wang, Jiangning Liu, Wenwei Zhang, Kai Chen, Feng Zhao","Information seeking and integration is a complex cognitive task that consumes enormous time and effort. Inspired by the remarkable progress of Large Language Models, recent works attempt to solve this task by combining LLMs and search engines. However, these methods still obtain unsatisfying performance due to three challenges: (1) complex requests often cannot be accurately and completely retrieved by the search engine once (2) corresponding information to be integrated is spread over multiple web pages along with massive noise, and (3) a large number of web pages with long contents may quickly exceed the maximum context length of LLMs. Inspired by the cognitive process when humans solve these problems, we introduce MindSearch to mimic the human minds in web information seeking and integration, which can be instantiated by a simple yet effective LLM-based multi-agent framework. The WebPlanner models the human mind of multi-step information seeking as a dynamic graph construction process: it decomposes the user query into atomic sub-questions as nodes in the graph and progressively extends the graph based on the search result from WebSearcher. Tasked with each sub-question, WebSearcher performs hierarchical information retrieval with search engines and collects valuable information for WebPlanner. The multi-agent design of MindSearch enables the whole framework to seek and integrate information parallelly from larger-scale (e.g., more than 300) web pages in 3 minutes, which is worth 3 hours of human effort. MindSearch demonstrates significant improvement in the response quality in terms of depth and breadth, on both close-set and open-set QA problems. Besides, responses from MindSearch based on InternLM2.5-7B are preferable by humans to ChatGPT-Web and Perplexity.ai applications, which implies that MindSearch can already deliver a competitive solution to the proprietary AI search engine."
Poster,MindSimulator: Exploring Brain Concept Localization via Synthetic fMRI,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27898,"Guangyin Bao, Qi Zhang, Zixuan Gong, Zhuojia Wu, Duoqian Miao","Concept-selective regions within the human cerebral cortex exhibit significant activation in response to specific visual stimuli associated with particular concepts. Precisely localizing these regions stands as a crucial long-term goal in neuroscience to grasp essential brain functions and mechanisms. Conventional experiment-driven approaches hinge on manually constructed visual stimulus collections and corresponding brain activity recordings, constraining the support and coverage of concept localization. Additionally, these stimuli often consist of concept objects in unnatural contexts and are potentially biased by subjective preferences, thus prompting concerns about the validity and generalizability of the identified regions. To address these limitations, we propose a data-driven exploration approach. By synthesizing extensive brain activity recordings, we statistically localize various concept-selective regions. Our proposed MindSimulator leverages advanced generative technologies to learn the probability distribution of brain activity conditioned on concept-oriented visual stimuli. This enables the creation of simulated brain recordings that reflect real neural response patterns. Using the synthetic recordings, we successfully localize several well-studied concept-selective regions and validate them against empirical findings, achieving promising prediction accuracy. The feasibility opens avenues for exploring novel concept-selective regions and provides prior hypotheses for future neuroscience research."
Poster,Mind the Gap: Examining the Self-Improvement Capabilities of Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28441,"Yuda Song, Hanlin Zhang, Carson Eisenach, Sham Kakade, Dean Foster, Udaya Ghai","Self-improvement is a mechanism in Large Language Model (LLM) pre-training, post-training and test-time inference. We explore a framework where the model verifies its own outputs, filters or reweights data based on this verification, and distills the filtered data.  Despite several empirical successes, a fundamental understanding is still lacking. In this work, we initiate a comprehensive, modular and controlled study on LLM self-improvement. We provide a mathematical formulation for self-improvement, which is largely governed by a quantity which we formalize as the **generation-verification gap**. Through experiments with various model families and tasks, we discover a scaling phenomenon of self-improvement -- a variant of the generation-verification gap scales monotonically with the model pre-training flops. We also examine when self-improvement is possible, an iterative self-improvement procedure, and ways to improve its performance. Our findings not only advance understanding of LLM self-improvement with practical implications, but also open numerous avenues for future research into its capabilities and boundaries."
Poster,Mind the GAP: Glimpse-based Active Perception improves generalization and sample efficiency of visual reasoning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28691,"Oleh Kolner, Thomas Ortner, Stanisław Woźniak, Angeliki Pantazi","Human capabilities in understanding visual relations are far superior to those of AI systems, especially for previously unseen objects. For example, while AI systems struggle to determine whether two such objects are visually the same or different, humans can do so with ease. Active vision theories postulate that the learning of visual relations is grounded in actions that we take to fixate objects and their parts by moving our eyes. In particular, the low-dimensional spatial information about the corresponding eye movements is hypothesized to facilitate the representation of relations between different image parts. Inspired by these theories, we develop a system equipped with a novel Glimpse-based Active Perception (GAP) that sequentially glimpses at the most salient regions of the input image and processes them at high resolution. Importantly, our system leverages the locations stemming from the glimpsing actions, along with the visual content around them, to represent relations between different parts of the image. The results suggest that the GAP is essential for extracting visual relations that go beyond the immediate visual content. Our approach reaches state-of-the-art performance on several visual reasoning tasks being more sample-efficient, and generalizing better to out-of-distribution visual inputs than prior models."
Poster,Mini-batch Coresets for Memory-efficient Language Model Training on Data Mixtures,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29123,"Dang Nguyen, Wenhan Yang, Rathul Anand, Yu Yang, Baharan Mirzasoleiman","Training with larger mini-batches improves the convergence rate and can yield superior performance. However, training with large mini-batches becomes prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs), due to the large GPU memory requirement. To address this problem, an effective approach is finding small mini-batch coresets that closely match the gradient of larger mini-batches. However, this approach becomes infeasible and ineffective for LLMs, due to the highly imbalanced mixture of sources in language data, use of the Adam optimizer, and the very large gradient dimensionality of LLMs. In this work, we address the above challenges by proposing *Coresets for Training LLMs* (CoLM). First, we show that mini-batch coresets found by gradient matching do not contain representative examples of the small sources w.h.p., and thus including all examples of the small sources in the mini-batch coresets is crucial for optimal performance. Second, we normalize the gradients by their historical exponential to find mini-batch coresets for training with Adam. Finally, we leverage zeroth-order methods to find smooth gradient of the last *V*-projection matrix and sparsify it to keep the dimensions with the largest normalized gradient magnitude. We apply CoLM to fine-tuning Phi-2, Phi-3, Zephyr, and Llama-3 models with LoRA on MathInstruct and SuperGLUE benchmark. Remarkably, CoLM reduces the memory requirement of fine-tuning by 2x and even outperforms training with 4x larger mini-batches. Moreover, CoLM seamlessly integrates with existing memory-efficient training methods like LoRA, further reducing the memory requirements of training LLMs."
Poster,miniCTX: Neural Theorem Proving with (Long-)Contexts,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30064,"Jiewen Hu, Thomas Zhu, Sean Welleck","Real-world formal theorem proving often depends on a wealth of context, including definitions, lemmas, comments, file structure, and other information. We introduce $\texttt{miniCTX}$, which tests a model's ability to prove formal mathematical theorems that depend on new context that is not seen during training. $\texttt{miniCTX}$ contains theorems sourced from real Lean projects and textbooks, each associated with a context that can span tens of thousands of tokens. Models are tasked with proving a theorem given access to code from the theorem's repository, which contains context that is needed for the proof. As a baseline for $\texttt{miniCTX}$, we tested fine-tuning and prompting methods that condition theorem proving on preceding context. Both approaches substantially outperform traditional methods that rely solely on state information. We found that this ability to use context is not captured by previous benchmarks such as $\texttt{miniF2F}$. Alongside $\texttt{miniCTX}$, we offer $\texttt{ntp-toolkit}$ for automatically extracting and annotating theorem proving data, making it easy to add new projects into $\texttt{miniCTX}$ to ensure that contexts are not seen during training. $\texttt{miniCTX}$ offers a challenging and realistic evaluation of neural theorem provers."
Poster,Minimal Impact ControlNet: Advancing Multi-ControlNet Integration,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28156,"Shikun Sun, Min Zhou, Zixuan Wang, Xubin Li, Tiezheng Ge, Zijie Ye, Xiaoyu Qin, Junliang Xing, Bo Zheng, Jia Jia","With the advancement of diffusion models, there is a growing demand for high-quality, controllable image generation, particularly through methods that utilize one or multiple control signals based on ControlNet. However, in current ControlNet training, each control is designed to influence all areas of an image, which can lead to conflicts when different control signals are expected to manage different parts of the image in practical applications. This issue is especially pronounced with edge-type control conditions, where regions lacking boundary information often represent low-frequency signals, referred to as silent control signals. When combining multiple ControlNets, these silent control signals can suppress the generation of textures in related areas, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. To address this problem, we propose Minimal Impact ControlNet. Our approach mitigates conflicts through three key strategies: constructing a balanced dataset, combining and injecting feature signals in a balanced manner, and addressing the asymmetry in the score function’s Jacobian matrix induced by ControlNet. These improvements enhance the compatibility of control signals, allowing for freer and more harmonious generation in areas with silent control signals."
Poster,Minimalistic Predictions for Online Class Constraint Scheduling,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28651,"Dorian Guyot, Alexandra Lassota","We consider online scheduling with class constraints. That is, we are given $m$ machines, each with $k$ class slots. Upon receiving a job $j$ with class $c_j$, an algorithm needs to allocate $j$ on some machine $i$. The goal is to minimize the makespan while not assigning more than $k$ different classes onto each machine.While the offline case is well understood and even (E)PTAS results are known [Jansen, Lassota, Maack SPAA'20, Chen Jansen Luo Zhang COCOA'16], the online case admits strong impossibility results in classical competitive analysis [Epstein, Lassota, Levin, Maack, Rohwedder STACS'22].We overcome these daunting results by investigating the problem in a learning-augmented setting where an algorithm can access possibly erroneous predictions. We present new algorithms with competitive ratios independent of $m$ and tight lower bounds for several classical and problem-specific prediction models. We thereby give a structured overview of what additional information helps in the design of better scheduling algorithms."
