Poster,Measuring memorization in RLHF for code completion,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29527,"Jamie Hayes, I Shumailov, Billy Porter, Aneesh Pappu","Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has become the dominant method to align large models to user preferences.Unlike fine-tuning, for which there are many studies regarding training data memorization, it is not clear how memorization is affected by or introduced in the RLHF alignment process.Understanding this relationship is important as real user data may be collected and used to align large models; if user data is memorized during RLHF and later regurgitated, this could raise privacy concerns. In addition to RLHF, other methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and $\Psi$PO have gained popularity for learning directly from human preferences, removing the need for optimizing intermediary reward models with reinforcement learning.In this work, we analyze how training data memorization can surface and propagate through each phase of RLHF and direct preference learning.We focus our study on code completion models, as code completion is one of the most popular use cases for large language models. We find that RLHF significantly decreases the chance that data used for reward modeling and reinforcement learning is memorized in comparison to directly fine-tuning on this data, but that examples already memorized during the fine-tuning stage of RLHF, will, in the majority of cases, remain memorized after RLHF. In contrast, we find that aligning by learning directly from human preference data via a special case of $\Psi$PO, Identity Preference Optimization (IPO), increases the likelihood that training data is regurgitated compared to RLHF. Our work suggests that RLHF, as opposed to direct preference learning, is a safer way to mitigate the risk of  regurgitating sensitive preference data when aligning large language models. We find our conclusions are robust across multiple code completion datasets, tasks, and model scales."
Poster,Measuring Non-Adversarial Reproduction of Training Data in Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30966,"Michael Aerni, Javier Rando, Edoardo Debenedetti, Nicholas Carlini, Daphne Ippolito, Florian Tramer","Large language models memorize parts of their training data. Memorizing short snippets and facts is required to answer questions about the world and to be fluent in any language. But models have also been shown to reproduce long verbatim sequences of memorized text when prompted by a motivated adversary. In this work, we investigate an intermediate regime of memorization that we call non-adversarial reproduction, where we quantify the overlap between model responses and pretraining data when responding to natural and benign prompts. For a variety of innocuous prompt categories (e.g., writing a letter or a tutorial), we show that up to 15% of the text output by popular conversational language models overlaps with snippets from the Internet. In worst cases, we find generations where 100% of the content can be found exactly online. For the same tasks, we find that human-written text has far less overlap with Internet data. We further study whether prompting strategies can close this reproduction gap between models and humans. While appropriate prompting can reduce non-adversarial reproduction on average, we find that mitigating worst-case reproduction of training data requires stronger defenses—even for benign interactions."
Poster,Mechanism and Emergence of Stacked Attention Heads in Multi-Layer Transformers,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28194,Tiberiu Mușat,"In this paper, I introduce the retrieval problem, a simple yet common reasoning task that can be solved only by transformers with a minimum number of layers, which grows logarithmically with the input size. I empirically show that large language models can solve the task under different prompting formulations without any fine-tuning. To understand how transformers solve the retrieval problem, I train several transformers on a minimal formulation. Successful learning occurs only under the presence of an implicit curriculum. I uncover the learned mechanisms by studying the attention maps in the trained transformers. I also study the training process, uncovering that attention heads always emerge in a specific sequence guided by the implicit curriculum."
Poster,Mechanistic Interpretability Meets Vision Language Models: Insights and Limitations,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31330,"Yiming Liu, Yuhui Zhang, Serena Yeung","Vision language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4o, have rapidly evolved, demonstrating impressive capabilities across diverse tasks. However, much of the progress in this field has been driven by engineering efforts, with a limited understanding of how these models work. The lack of scientific insight poses challenges to further enhancing their robustness, generalization, and interpretability, especially in high-stakes settings. In this work, we systematically review the use of mechanistic interpretability methods to foster a more scientific and transparent understanding of VLMs. Specifically, we examine five prominent techniques: probing, activation patching, logit lens, sparse autoencoders, and automated explanation. We summarize the key insights these methods provide into how VLMs process information and make decisions. We also discuss critical challenges and limitations that must be addressed to further advance the field."
Poster,Mechanistic Permutability: Match Features Across Layers,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29946,"Nikita Balagansky, Ian Maksimov, Daniil Gavrilov","Understanding how features evolve across layers in deep neural networks is a fundamental challenge in mechanistic interpretability, particularly due to polysemanticity and feature superposition. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have been used to extract interpretable features from individual layers, aligning these features across layers has remained an open problem. In this paper, we introduce SAE Match, a novel, data-free method for aligning SAE features across different layers of a neural network. Our approach involves matching features by minimizing the mean squared error between the folded parameters of SAEs, a technique that incorporates activation thresholds into the encoder and decoder weights to account for differences in feature scales. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma 2 language model, we demonstrate that our method effectively captures feature evolution across layers, improving feature matching quality. We also show that features persist over several layers and that our approach can approximate hidden states across layers. Our work advances the understanding of feature dynamics in neural networks and provides a new tool for mechanistic interpretability studies."
Poster,MediConfusion: Can you trust your AI radiologist? Probing the reliability of multimodal medical foundation models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30242,"Mohammad Shahab Sepehri, Zalan Fabian, Maryam Soltanolkotabi, Mahdi Soltanolkotabi","Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have tremendous potential to improve the accuracy, availability, and cost-effectiveness of healthcare by providing automated solutions or serving as aids to medical professionals. Despite promising first steps in developing medical MLLMs in the past few years, their capabilities and limitations are not well understood. Recently, many benchmark datasets have been proposed that test the general medical knowledge of such models across a variety of medical areas. However, the systematic failure modes and vulnerabilities of such models are severely underexplored with most medical benchmarks failing to expose the shortcomings of existing models in this safety-critical domain. In this paper, we introduce MediConfusion, a challenging medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark dataset, that probes the failure modes of medical MLLMs from a vision perspective. We reveal that state-of-the-art models are easily confused by image pairs that are otherwise visually dissimilar and clearly distinct for medical experts. Strikingly, all available models (open-source or proprietary) achieve performance below random guessing on MediConfusion, raising serious concerns about the reliability of existing medical MLLMs for healthcare deployment. We also extract common patterns of model failure that may help the design of a new generation of more trustworthy and reliable MLLMs in healthcare."
Poster,Medium-Difficulty Samples Constitute Smoothed Decision Boundary for Knowledge Distillation on Pruned Datasets,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29633,"Yudong Chen, Xuwei Xu, Frank de Hoog, Jiajun Liu, Sen Wang","This paper tackles a new problem of dataset pruning for Knowledge Distillation (KD), from a fresh perspective of Decision Boundary (DB) preservation and drifts. Existing dataset pruning methods generally assume that the post-pruning DB formed by the selected samples can be well-captured by future networks that use those samples for training. Therefore, they tend to preserve hard samples since hard samples are closer to the DB and better characterize the nuances in the distribution of the entire dataset. However, in KD, the limited learning capacity from the student network leads to imperfect preservation of the teacher's feature distribution, resulting in the drift of DB in the student space. Specifically, hard samples worsen such drifts as they are difficult for the student to learn, creating a situation where the student's DB can drift deeper into other classes and make incorrect classifications. Motivated by these findings, our method selects medium-difficulty samples for KD-based dataset pruning. We show that these samples constitute a smoothed version of the teacher's DB and are easier for the student to learn, obtaining a general feature distribution preservation for a class of samples and reasonable DB between different classes for the student. In addition, to reduce the distributional shift due to dataset pruning, we leverage the class-wise distributional information of the teacher's outputs to reshape the logits of the preserved samples. Experiments show that the proposed static pruning method can even perform better than the state-of-the-art dynamic pruning method which needs access to the entire dataset. In addition, our method halves the training times of KD and improves the student's accuracy by 0.4% on ImageNet with a 50% keep ratio. When the ratio further increases to 70%, our method achieves higher accuracy over the vanilla KD while reducing the training times by 30%. Code is available at https://github.com/chenyd7/MDSLR."
Poster,MedTrinity-25M: A Large-scale Multimodal Dataset with Multigranular Annotations for Medicine,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30141,"Yunfei Xie, Ce Zhou, Lang Gao, Juncheng Wu, Xianhang Li, Hong-Yu Zhou, Sheng Liu, Lei Xing, James Y Zou, Cihang Xie, Yuyin Zhou","This paper introduces MedTrinity-25M, a comprehensive, large-scale multimodal dataset for medicine, covering over 25 million images across 10 modalities with multigranular annotations for more than 65 diseases. These multigranular annotations encompass both global information, such as modality and organ detection, and local information like ROI analysis, lesion texture, and region-wise correlations. Unlike the existing multimodal datasets, which are limited by the availability of image-text pairs, we have developed the first automated pipeline that scales up multimodal data by generating multigranular visual and textual annotations in the form of image-ROI-description triplets without the need for any paired text descriptions. Specifically, data from over 30 different sources have been collected, preprocessed, and grounded using domain-specific expert models to identify ROIs related to abnormal regions. We then build a comprehensive knowledge base and prompt multimodal large language models to perform retrieval-augmented generation with the identified ROIs as guidance, resulting in multigranular textual descriptions. Compared to existing datasets, MedTrinity-25M provides the most enriched annotations, supporting a comprehensive range of multimodal tasks such as captioning and report generation, as well as vision-centric tasks like classification and segmentation. We propose LLaVA-Tri by pretraining LLaVA on MedTrinity-25M, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and PathVQA, surpassing representative SOTA multimodal large language models. Furthermore, MedTrinity-25M can also be utilized to support large-scale pre-training of multimodal medical AI models, contributing to the development of future foundation models in the medical domain. We will make our dataset available. The dataset is publicly available at https://yunfeixie233.github.io/MedTrinity-25M/."
Poster,MEGA-Bench: Scaling Multimodal Evaluation to over 500 Real-World Tasks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31110,"Jiacheng Chen, Tianhao Liang, Sherman Siu, Zhengqing Wang, Kai Wang, Yubo Wang, Yuansheng Ni, Ziyan Jiang, Wang Zhu, Bohan Lyu, Dongfu Jiang, Xuan He, Yuan Liu, Hexiang Hu, Xiang Yue, Wenhu Chen","We present MEGA-Bench, an evaluation suite that scales multimodal evaluation to over 500 real-world tasks, to address the highly heterogeneous daily use cases of end users.Our objective is to optimize for a set of high-quality data samples that cover a highly diverse and rich set of multimodal tasks, while enabling cost-effective and accurate model evaluation.In particular, we collected 505 realistic tasks encompassing over 8,000 samples from 16 expert annotators to extensively cover the multimodal task space. Instead of unifying these problems into standard multi-choice questions (like MMMU, MM-Bench, and MMT-Bench), we embrace a wide range of output formats like numbers, phrases, code, \LaTeX, coordinates, JSON, free-form, etc. To accommodate these formats, we developed over 40 metrics to evaluate these tasks. Unlike existing benchmarks, MEGA-Bench offers a fine-grained capability report across multiple dimensions (e.g., application, input type, output format, skill), allowing users to interact with and visualize model capabilities in depth. We evaluate a wide variety of frontier vision-language models on MEGA-Bench to understand their capabilities across these dimensions."
Poster,Meissonic: Revitalizing Masked Generative Transformers for Efficient High-Resolution Text-to-Image Synthesis,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30289,"Jinbin Bai, Tian Ye, Wei Chow, Enxin Song, Qing-Guo Chen, Xiangtai Li, Zhen Dong, Lei Zhu, Shuicheng YAN","We present Meissonic, which elevates non-autoregressive text-to-image Masked Image Modeling (MIM) to a level comparable with state-of-the-art diffusion models like SDXL. By incorporating a comprehensive suite of architectural innovations, advanced positional encoding strategies, and optimized sampling conditions, Meissonic substantially improves MIM's performance and efficiency. Additionally, we leverage high-quality training data, integrate micro-conditions informed by human preference scores, and employ feature compression layers to further enhance image fidelity and resolution. Our model not only matches but often exceeds the performance of existing methods in generating high-quality, high-resolution images. Extensive experiments validate Meissonic’s capabilities, demonstrating its potential as a new standard in text-to-image synthesis."
