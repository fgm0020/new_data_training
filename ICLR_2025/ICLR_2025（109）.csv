Poster,ELFS: Label-Free Coreset Selection with Proxy Training Dynamics,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27703,"Haizhong Zheng, Elisa Tsai, Yifu Lu, Jiachen Sun, Brian Bartoldson, Bhavya Kailkhura, Atul Prakash","High-quality human-annotated data is crucial for modern deep learning pipelines, yet the human annotation process is both costly and time-consuming. Given a constrained human labeling budget, selecting an informative and representative data subset for labeling can significantly reduce human annotation effort. Well-performing state-of-the-art (SOTA) coreset selection methods require ground truth labels over the whole dataset, failing to reduce the human labeling burden. Meanwhile, SOTA label-free coreset selection methods deliver inferior performance due to poor geometry-based difficulty scores. In this paper, we introduce ELFS (Effective Label-Free Coreset Selection), a novel label-free coreset selection method. ELFS significantly improves label-free coreset selection by addressing two challenges: 1) ELFS utilizes deep clustering to estimate training dynamics-based data difficulty scores without ground truth labels; 2) Pseudo-labels introduce a distribution shift in the data difficulty scores, and we propose a simple but effective double-end pruning method to mitigate bias on calculated scores. We evaluate ELFS on four vision benchmarks and show that, given the same vision encoder, ELFS consistently outperforms SOTA label-free baselines. For instance, when using SwAV as the encoder, ELFS outperforms D2 by up to 10.2% in accuracy on ImageNet-1K. We make our code publicly available on GitHub."
Poster,Eliciting Human Preferences with Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29967,"Belinda Li, Alex Tamkin, Noah Goodman, Jacob Andreas","Language models (LMs) can be directed to perform user- and context-dependenttasks by using labeled examples or natural language prompts.But selecting examples or writing prompts can be challenging---especially in tasks that require users to precisely articulate nebulous preferences or reason about complex edge cases. For such tasks, we introduce **Generative Active Task Elicitation (GATE)**, a method for using *LMs themselves* to guide the task specification process. GATE is a learning framework in which models elicit and infer human preferences through free-form, language-based interaction with users.We identify prototypical challenges that users face when specifying preferences, and design three preference modeling tasks to study these challenges:content recommendation, moral reasoning, and email validation.In preregistered experiments, we show that LMs that learn to perform these tasks using GATE (by interactively querying users with open-ended questions) obtain preference specifications that are more informative than user-written prompts or examples. GATE matches existing task specification methods in the moral reasoning task, and significantly outperforms them in the content recommendation and email validation tasks. Users additionally report that interactive task elicitation requires less effort than prompting or example labeling and surfaces considerations that they did not anticipate on their own. Our findings suggest that LM-driven elicitation can be a powerful tool for aligning models to complex human preferences and values."
Poster,ELICIT: LLM Augmentation Via External In-context Capability,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30525,"Futing Wang, Jianhao (Elliott) Yan, Yue Zhang, Tao Lin","Enhancing the adaptive capabilities of large language models is a critical pursuit in both research and application.Traditional fine-tuning methods require substantial data, computational resources, and specific capabilities, while in-context learning is limited by the need for appropriate demonstrations and efficient token usage.    Inspired by the expression of in-context learned capabilities through task vectors and the concept of modular capability or knowledge, we propose ELICIT, a framework consisting of two modules designed to effectively store and reuse task vectors to enhance the diverse adaptive capabilities of models without additional training or inference tokens.    Our comprehensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that our pipeline is highly transferable across different input formats, tasks, and model architectures.    Externally storing and reusing vectors that represent in-context learned capabilities not only shows the potential to extract modular capabilities but also significantly enhances the performance, versatility, adaptability, and scalability of large language models, paving the way for more efficient and effective use of these models in a wide range of applications."
Poster,Eliminating Oversaturation and Artifacts of High Guidance Scales in Diffusion Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28952,"Seyedmorteza Sadat, Otmar Hilliges, Romann Weber","Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is crucial for improving both generation quality and alignment between the input condition and final output in diffusion models. While a high guidance scale is generally required to enhance these aspects, it also causes oversaturation and unrealistic artifacts. In this paper, we revisit the CFG update rule and introduce modifications to address this issue. We first decompose the update term in CFG into parallel and orthogonal components with respect to the conditional model prediction and observe that the parallel component primarily causes oversaturation, while the orthogonal component enhances image quality. Accordingly, we propose down-weighting the parallel component to achieve high-quality generations without oversaturation. Additionally, we draw a connection between CFG and gradient ascent and introduce a new rescaling and momentum method for the CFG update rule based on this insight. Our approach, termed adaptive projected guidance (APG), retains the quality-boosting advantages of CFG while enabling the use of higher guidance scales without oversaturation. APG is easy to implement and introduces practically no additional computational overhead to the sampling process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that APG is compatible with various conditional diffusion models and samplers, leading to improved FID, recall, and saturation scores while maintaining precision comparable to CFG, making our method a superior plug-and-play alternative to standard classifier-free guidance."
Poster,Eliminating Position Bias of Language Models: A Mechanistic Approach,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28841,"Ziqi Wang, Hanlin Zhang, Xiner Li, Kuan-Hao Huang, Chi Han, Shuiwang Ji, Sham Kakade, Hao Peng, Heng Ji","Position bias has proven to be a prevalent issue of modern language models (LMs), where the models prioritize content based on its position within the given context. This bias often leads to unexpected model failures and hurts performance, robustness, and reliability across various applications. A simple mechanistic analysis attributes the position bias to two components employed in nearly all state-of-the-art LMs: causal attention and position embedding. Based on the analyses, we propose to **eliminate** position bias (e.g., different retrieved documents' orders in QA affect performance) with a **training-free zero-shot** approach. Our method changes the causal attention to bidirectional attention between documents and utilizes model attention values to decide the relative orders of documents instead of using the order provided in input prompts, therefore enabling Position-INvariant inferencE (PINE) at the document level. By eliminating position bias, models achieve better performance and reliability in downstream tasks, including LM-as-a-judge, retrieval-augmented QA, molecule generation, and math reasoning. Notably, PINE is especially useful when adapting LMs for evaluating reasoning pairs: it consistently provides $8$ to $10$ percentage points performance gains, making Llama-3-70B-Instruct perform even better than GPT-4-0125-preview and GPT-4o-2024-08-06 on the RewardBench reasoning set."
Poster,Elliptic Loss Regularization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29240,"Ali Hasan, Haoming Yang, Yuting Ng, VAHID TAROKH","Regularizing neural networks is important for anticipating model behavior in regions of the data space that are not well represented. In this work, we propose a regularization technique for enforcing a level of smoothness in the mapping between the input space and the loss. We specify the level of regularity by requiring that the loss of the network satisfies an elliptic operator over the data domain. To do this, we modify the usual empirical risk minimization objective such that we instead minimize a new objective that satisfies an elliptic operator over points within the domain. This allows us to use existing theory on elliptic operators to anticipate the behavior of the error for points outside the training set. We propose a tractable computational method that approximates the behavior of the elliptic operator while being computationally efficient. Finally, we analyze the properties of the proposed regularization to understand the performance on common problems of distribution shift and group imbalance. Numerical experiments empirically confirm the promise of the proposed regularization technique."
Poster,Elucidating the Preconditioning in Consistency Distillation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30971,"Kaiwen Zheng, Guande He, Jianfei Chen, Fan Bao, Jun Zhu","Consistency distillation is a prevalent way for accelerating diffusion models adopted in consistency (trajectory) models, in which a student model is trained to traverse backward on the probability flow (PF) ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory determined by the teacher model. Preconditioning is a vital technique for stabilizing consistency distillation, by linear combining the input data and the network output with pre-defined coefficients as the consistency function. It imposes the boundary condition of consistency functions without restricting the form and expressiveness of the neural network. However, previous preconditionings are hand-crafted and may be suboptimal choices. In this work, we offer the first theoretical insights into the preconditioning in consistency distillation, by elucidating its design criteria and the connection to the teacher ODE trajectory. Based on these analyses, we further propose a principled way dubbed \textit{Analytic-Precond} to analytically optimize the preconditioning according to the consistency gap (defined as the gap between the teacher denoiser and the optimal student denoiser) on a generalized teacher ODE. We demonstrate that Analytic-Precond can facilitate the learning of trajectory jumpers, enhance the alignment of the student trajectory with the teacher's, and achieve $2\times$ to $3\times$ training acceleration of consistency trajectory models in multi-step generation across various datasets."
Poster,EmbedLLM: Learning Compact Representations of Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30322,"Richard Zhuang, Tianhao Wu, Zhaojin Wen, Andrew Li, Jiantao Jiao, Kannan Ramchandran","With hundreds of thousands of language models available on Huggingface today, efficiently evaluating and utilizing these models across various downstream tasks has become increasingly critical. Many existing methods repeatedly learn task-specific representations of Large Language Models (LLMs), which leads to inefficiencies in both time and computational resources. To address this, we propose EmbedLLM, a framework designed to learn compact vector representations of LLMs that facilitate downstream applications involving many models, such as model routing. We introduce an encoder-decoder approach for learning such embedding, along with a systematic framework to evaluate their effectiveness. Empirical results show that EmbedLLM outperforms prior methods in model routing. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can forecast a model's performance on multiple benchmarks, without incurring additional inference cost. Extensive probing experiments validate that the learned embeddings capture key model characteristics, e.g. whether the model is specialized for coding tasks, even without being explicitly trained on them. We open source our dataset, code and embedder to facilitate further research and application."
Poster,EmbodiedSAM: Online Segment Any 3D Thing in Real Time,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29314,"Xiuwei Xu, Huangxing Chen, Linqing Zhao, Ziwei Wang, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu","Embodied tasks require the agent to fully understand 3D scenes simultaneously with its exploration, so an online, real-time, fine-grained and highly-generalized 3D perception model is desperately needed. Since high-quality 3D data is limited, directly training such a model in 3D is infeasible. Meanwhile, vision foundation models (VFM) has revolutionized the field of 2D computer vision with superior performance, which makes the use of VFM to assist embodied 3D perception a promising direction. However, most existing VFM-assisted 3D perception methods are either offline or too slow that cannot be applied in practical embodied tasks. In this paper, we aim to leverage Segment Anything Model (SAM) for real-time 3D instance segmentation in an online setting. This is a challenging problem since future frames are not available in the input streaming RGB-D video, and an instance may be observed in several frames so efficient object matching between frames is required. To address these challenges, we first propose a geometric-aware query lifting module to represent the 2D masks generated by SAM by 3D-aware queries, which is then iteratively refined by a dual-level query decoder. In this way, the 2D masks are transferred to fine-grained shapes on 3D point clouds. Benefit from the query representation for 3D masks, we can compute the similarity matrix between the 3D masks from different views by efficient matrix operation, which enables real-time inference. Experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, SceneNN and 3RScan show our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online 3D perception models, even outperforming offline VFM-assisted 3D instance segmentation methods by a large margin. Our method also demonstrates great generalization ability in several zero-shot dataset transferring experiments and show great potential in data-efficient setting."
Poster,Emergence of a High-Dimensional Abstraction Phase in Language Transformers,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31244,"Emily Cheng, Diego Doimo, Corentin Kervadec, Iuri Macocco, Lei Yu, Alessandro Laio, Marco Baroni","A language model (LM) is a mapping from a linguistic context to an output token. However, much remains to be known about this mapping, including how its geometric properties relate to its function. We take a high-level geometric approach to its analysis, observing, across five pre-trained transformer-based LMs and three input datasets, a distinct phase characterized by high intrinsic dimensionality. During this phase, representations (1) correspond to the first full linguistic abstraction of the input; (2) are the first to viably transfer to downstream tasks; (3) predict each other across different LMs. Moreover, we find that an earlier onset of the phase strongly predicts better language modelling performance. In short, our results suggest that a central high-dimensionality phase underlies core linguistic processing in many common LM architectures."
