Poster,Learning vector fields of differential equations on manifolds with geometrically constrained operator-valued kernels,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29790,"Daning Huang, Hanyang He, John Harlim, Yan Li","We address the problem of learning ordinary differential equations (ODEs) on manifolds. Existing machine learning methods, particularly those using neural networks, often struggle with high computational demands. To overcome this issue, we introduce a geometrically constrained operator-valued kernel that allows us to represent vector fields on tangent bundles of smooth manifolds. The construction of the kernel imposes the geometric constraints that are estimated from the data and ensures the computational feasibility for learning high dimensional systems of ODEs. Once the vector fields are estimated, e.g., by the kernel ridge regression, we need an ODE solver that guarantees the solution to stay on (or close to) the manifold. To overcome this issue, we propose a geometry-preserving ODE solver that approximates the exponential maps corresponding to the ODE solutions.  We deduce a theoretical error bound for the proposed solver that guarantees the approximate solutions to lie on the manifold in the limit of large data. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach on high-dimensional dynamical systems, including the cavity flow problem, the beating and travelling waves in Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations, and the reaction-diffusion dynamics."
Poster,Learning Video-Conditioned Policy on Unlabelled Data with Joint Embedding Predictive Transformer,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29514,"Hao Luo, Zongqing Lu","The video-conditioned policy takes prompt videos of the desired tasks as a condition and is regarded for its prospective generalizability. Despite its promise, training a video-conditioned policy is non-trivial due to the need for abundant demonstrations. In some tasks, the expert rollouts are merely available as videos, and costly and time-consuming efforts are required to annotate action labels. To address this, we explore training video-conditioned policy on a mixture of demonstrations and unlabeled expert videos to reduce reliance on extensive manual annotation. We introduce the Joint Embedding Predictive Transformer (JEPT) to learn a video-conditioned policy through sequence modeling. JEPT is designed to jointly learn visual transition prediction and inverse dynamics. The visual transition is captured from both demonstrations and expert videos, on the basis of which the inverse dynamics learned from demonstrations is generalizable to the tasks without action labels. Experiments on a series of simulated visual control tasks evaluate that JEPT can effectively leverage the mixture dataset to learn a generalizable policy. JEPT outperforms baselines in the tasks without action-labeled data and unseen tasks. We also experimentally reveal the potential of JEPT as a simple visual priors injection approach to enhance the video-conditioned policy."
Poster,Learning View-invariant World Models for Visual Robotic Manipulation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27921,"Jing-Cheng Pang, Nan Tang, Kaiyuan Li, Yuting Tang, Xin-Qiang Cai, Zhen-Yu Zhang, Gang Niu, Masashi Sugiyama, Yang Yu","Robotic manipulation tasks often rely on visual inputs from cameras to perceive the environment. However, previous approaches still suffer from performance degradation when the camera’s viewpoint changes during manipulation. In this paper, we propose ReViWo (Representation learning for View-invariant World model), leveraging multi-view data to learn robust representations for control under viewpoint disturbance. ReViWo utilizes an autoencoder framework to reconstruct target images by an architecture that combines view-invariant representation (VIR) and view-dependent representation. To train ReViWo, we collect multi-view data in simulators with known view labels, meanwhile, ReViWo is simutaneously trained on Open X-Embodiment datasets without view labels. The VIR is then used to train a world model on pre-collected manipulation data and a policy through interaction with the world model. We evaluate the effectiveness of ReViWo in various viewpoint disturbance scenarios, including control under novel camera positions and frequent camera shaking, using the Meta-world & PandaGym environments. Besides, we also conduct experiments on real world ALOHA robot. The results demonstrate that ReViWo maintains robust performance under viewpoint disturbance, while baseline methods suffer from significant performance degradation. Furthermore, we show that the VIR captures task-relevant state information and remains stable for observations from novel viewpoints, validating the efficacy of the ReViWo approach."
Poster,Learn Your Reference Model for Real Good Alignment,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30247,"Alexey Gorbatovski, Boris Shaposhnikov, Alexey Malakhov, Nikita Surnachev, Yaroslav Aksenov, Ian Maksimov, Nikita Balagansky, Daniil Gavrilov","Despite the fact that offline methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment do not require a direct reward model, they remain susceptible to overoptimization. This issue arises when the trained model deviates excessively from the reference policy, leading to a decrease in sample quality. We propose a novel approach of offline alignment methods, called Trust Region (including variants TR-DPO, TR-IPO, TR-KTO), which dynamically updates the reference policy throughout the training process. Our results show that TR alignment methods effectively mitigate overoptimization, enabling models to maintain strong performance even when substantially deviating from the initial reference policy. We demonstrate the efficacy of these approaches not only through toy examples that exhibit reduced overoptimization, but also through direct, side-by-side comparisons in specific tasks such as helpful and harmless dialogue, as well as summarization, where they surpass conventional methods. Additionally, we report significant improvements in general-purpose assistant setups with the Llama3 model on the AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks, highlighting the advantages of Trust Region methods over classical approaches."
Poster,Leave-One-Out Stable Conformal Prediction,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30540,"Kiljae Lee, Yuan Zhang","Conformal prediction (CP) is an important tool for distribution-free predictive uncertainty quantification.Yet, a major challenge is to balance computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, particularly for multiple predictions.We propose **L**eave-**O**ne-**O**ut **Stab**le **C**onformal **P**rediction (LOO-StabCP), a novel method to speed up full conformal using algorithmic stability without sample splitting.By leveraging *leave-one-out* stability, our method is much faster in handling a large number of prediction requests compared to existing method RO-StabCP based on *replace-one* stability.We derived stability bounds for several popular machine learning tools: regularized loss minimization (RLM) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD), as well as kernel method, neural networks and bagging.Our method is theoretically justified and demonstrates superior numerical performance on synthetic and real-world data.We applied our method to a screening problem, where its effective exploitation of training data led to improved test power compared to state-of-the-art method based on split conformal."
Poster,LeFusion: Controllable Pathology Synthesis via Lesion-Focused Diffusion Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31069,"Hantao Zhang, Yuhe Liu, Jiancheng Yang, Shouhong Wan, Xinyuan Wang, Wei Peng, Pascal Fua","Patient data from real-world clinical practice often suffers from data scarcity and long-tail imbalances, leading to biased outcomes or algorithmic unfairness. This study addresses these challenges by generating lesion-containing image-segmentation pairs from lesion-free images. Previous efforts in medical imaging synthesis have struggled with separating lesion information from background, resulting in low-quality backgrounds and limited control over the synthetic output. Inspired by diffusion-based image inpainting, we propose LeFusion, a lesion-focused diffusion model. By redesigning the diffusion learning objectives to focus on lesion areas, we simplify the learning process and improve control over the output while preserving high-fidelity backgrounds by integrating forward-diffused background contexts into the reverse diffusion process. Additionally, we tackle two major challenges in lesion texture synthesis: 1) multi-peak and 2) multi-class lesions. We introduce two effective strategies: histogram-based texture control and multi-channel decomposition, enabling the controlled generation of high-quality lesions in difficult scenarios. Furthermore, we incorporate lesion mask diffusion, allowing control over lesion size, location, and boundary, thus increasing lesion diversity. Validated on 3D cardiac lesion MRI and lung nodule CT datasets, LeFusion-generated data significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art segmentation models, including nnUNet and SwinUNETR."
Poster,Less is More: Masking Elements in Image Condition Features Avoids Content Leakages in Style Transfer Diffusion Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/32107,"Lin Zhu, Xinbing Wang, Chenghu Zhou, Qinying Gu, Nanyang Ye","Given a style-reference image as the additional image condition, text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating images that possess the content of text prompts while adopting the visual style of the reference image. However, current state-of-the-art methods often struggle to disentangle content and style from style-reference images, leading to issues such as content leakages. To address this issue, we propose a masking-based method that efficiently decouples content from style without the need of tuning any model parameters. By simply masking specific elements in the style reference's image features, we uncover a critical yet under-explored principle: guiding with appropriately-selected fewer conditions (e.g., dropping several image feature elements) can efficiently avoid unwanted content flowing into the diffusion models, enhancing the style transfer performances of text-to-image diffusion models. In this paper, we validate this finding both theoretically and experimentally. Extensive experiments across various styles demonstrate the effectiveness of our masking-based method and support our theoretical results."
Poster,Let Me Grok for You: Accelerating Grokking via Embedding Transfer from a Weaker Model,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30991,"Zhiwei Xu, Zhiyu Ni, Yixin Wang, Wei Hu","''Grokking'' is a phenomenon where a neural network first memorizes training data and generalizes poorly, but then suddenly transitions to near-perfect generalization after prolonged training. While intriguing, this delayed generalization phenomenon compromises predictability and efficiency. Ideally, models should generalize directly without delay. To this end, this paper proposes GrokTransfer, a simple and principled method for accelerating grokking in training neural networks, based on the key observation that data embedding plays acrucial role in determining whether generalization is delayed. GrokTransfer first trains a smaller, weaker model to reach a nontrivial (but far from optimal) test performance. Then, the learned input embedding from this weaker model is extracted and used to initialize the embedding in the target, stronger model. We rigorously prove that, on a synthetic XOR task where delayed generalization alwaysoccurs in normal training, GrokTransfer enables the target model to generalize directly without delay. Moreover, we demonstrate that, across empirical studies of different tasks, GrokTransfer effectively reshapes the training dynamics and eliminates delayed generalization, for both fully-connected neural networks and Transformers."
Poster,Let SSMs be ConvNets: State-space Modeling with Optimal Tensor Contractions,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29733,Yan Ru Pei,"We introduce Centaurus, a class of networks composed of generalized state-space model (SSM) blocks, where the SSM operations can be treated as tensor contractions during training. The optimal order of tensor contractions can then be systematically determined for every SSM block to maximize training efficiency. This allows more flexibility in designing SSM blocks beyond the depthwise-separable configuration commonly implemented. The new design choices will take inspiration from classical convolutional blocks including group convolutions, full convolutions, and bottleneck blocks. We architect the Centaurus network with a mixture of these blocks, to balance between network size and performance, as well as memory and computational efficiency during both training and inference. We show that this heterogeneous network design outperforms its homogeneous counterparts in raw audio processing tasks including keyword spotting, speech denoising, and automatic speech recognition (ASR). For ASR, Centaurus is the first network with competitive performance that can be made fully state-space based, without using any nonlinear recurrence (LSTMs), explicit convolutions (CNNs), or (surrogate) attention mechanism."
Poster,Let the Code LLM Edit Itself When You Edit the Code,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27645,"Zhenyu He, Jun Zhang, Shengjie Luo, Jingjing Xu, Zhi Zhang, Di He","In this work, we investigate a typical scenario in code generation where a developer edits existing code in real time and requests a code assistant, e.g., a large language model, to re-predict the next token or next line on the fly. Naively, the LLM needs to re-encode the entire KV cache to provide an accurate prediction. However, this process is computationally expensive, especially when the sequence length is long. Simply encoding the edited subsequence and integrating it to the original KV cache meets the temporal confusion problem, leading to significantly worse performance. We address this efficiency and accuracy trade-off by introducing $\underline{\textbf{P}\text{ositional}\  \textbf{I}\text{ntegrity}\  \textbf{E}\text{ncoding}}$ (PIE). Building upon the rotary positional encoding, PIE first removes the rotary matrices in the Key cache that introduce temporal confusion and then reapplies the correct rotary matrices. This process ensures that positional relationships between tokens are correct and requires only a single round of matrix multiplication. We validate the effectiveness of PIE through extensive experiments on the RepoBench-C-8k dataset, utilizing DeepSeek-Coder models with 1.3B, 6.7B, and 33B parameters. Our evaluation includes three real-world coding tasks: code insertion, code deletion, and multi-place code editing. Results demonstrate that PIE reduces computational overhead by over 85%  compared to the standard full recomputation approach across all model sizes and tasks while well approximating the model performance."
