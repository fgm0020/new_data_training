Poster,Structural-Entropy-Based Sample Selection for Efficient and Effective Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27779,"Tianchi Xie, Jiangning Zhu, Guozu Ma, Minzhi Lin, Wei Chen, Weikai Yang, Shixia Liu","Sample selection improves the efficiency and effectiveness of machine learning models by providing informative and representative samples. Typically, samples can be modeled as a sample graph, where nodes are samples and edges represent their similarities. Most existing methods are based on local information, such as the training difficulty of samples, thereby overlooking global information, such as connectivity patterns. This oversight can result in suboptimal selection because global information is crucial for ensuring that the selected samples well represent the structural properties of the graph. To address this issue, we employ structural entropy to quantify global information and losslessly decompose it from the whole graph to individual nodes using the Shapley value. Based on the decomposition, we present $\textbf{S}$tructural-$\textbf{E}$ntropy-based sample $\textbf{S}$election ($\textbf{SES}$), a method that integrates both global and local information to select informative and representative samples. SES begins by constructing a $k$NN-graph among samples based on their similarities. It then measures sample importance by combining structural entropy (global metric) with training difficulty (local metric). Finally, SES applies importance-biased blue noise sampling to select a set of diverse and representative samples. Comprehensive experiments on three learning scenarios --- supervised learning, active learning, and continual learning --- clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
Poster,Structure Language Models for Protein Conformation Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29785,"Jiarui Lu, Xiaoyin Chen, Stephen Lu, Chence Shi, Hongyu Guo, Yoshua Bengio, Jian Tang","Proteins adopt multiple structural conformations to perform their diverse biological functions, and understanding these conformations is crucial for advancing drug discovery. Traditional physics-based simulation methods often struggle with sampling equilibrium conformations and are computationally expensive. Recently, deep generative models have shown promise in generating protein conformations as a more efficient alternative. However, these methods predominantly rely on the diffusion process within a 3D geometric space, which typically centers around the vicinity of metastable states and is often inefficient in terms of runtime. In this paper, we introduce Structure Language Modeling (SLM) as a novel framework for efficient protein conformation generation. Specifically, the protein structures are first encoded into a compact latent space using a discrete variational auto-encoder, followed by conditional language modeling that effectively captures sequence-specific conformation distributions.  This enables a more efficient and interpretable exploration of diverse ensemble modes compared to existing methods. Based on this general framework, we instantiate SLM with various popular LM architectures as well as proposing the ESMDiff, a novel BERT-like structure language model fine-tuned from ESM3 with masked diffusion. We verify our approach in various scenarios, including the equilibrium dynamics of BPTI, conformational change pairs, and intrinsically disordered proteins. SLM provides a highly efficient solution, offering a 20-100x speedup than existing methods in generating diverse conformations, shedding light on promising avenues for future research."
Poster,Structuring Benchmark into Knowledge Graphs to Assist Large Language Models in Retrieving and Designing Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31033,"Hanmo Liu, Shimin Di, Jialiang Wang, Zhili Wang, Jiachuan Wang, Xiaofang Zhou, Lei Chen","In recent years, the design and transfer of neural network models have been widely studied due to their exceptional performance and capabilities. However, the complex nature of datasets and the vast architecture space pose significant challenges for both manual and automated algorithms in creating high-performance models. Inspired by researchers who design, train, and document the performance of various models across different datasets, this paper introduces a novel schema that transforms the benchmark data into a Knowledge Benchmark Graph (KBG), which primarily stores the facts in the form of performance(data, model). Constructing the KBG facilitates the structured storage of design knowledge, aiding subsequent model design and transfer. However, it is a non-trivial task to retrieve or design suitable neural networks based on the KBG, as real-world data are often off the records. To tackle this challenge, we propose transferring existing models stored in KBG by establishing correlations between unseen and previously seen datasets. Given that measuring dataset similarity is a complex and open-ended issue, we explore the potential for evaluating the correctness of the similarity function. Then, we further integrate the KBG with Large Language Models (LLMs), assisting LLMs to think and retrieve existing model knowledge in a manner akin to humans when designing or transferring models. We demonstrate our method specifically in the context of Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture design, constructing a KBG (with 26,206 models, 211,669 performance records, and 2,540,064 facts) and validating the effectiveness of leveraging the KBG to promote GNN architecture design."
Poster,Student-Informed Teacher Training,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30431,"Nico Messikommer, Jiaxu Xing, Elie Aljalbout, Davide Scaramuzza","Imitation learning with a privileged teacher has proven effective for learning complex control behaviors from high-dimensional inputs, such as images. In this framework, a teacher is trained with privileged task information, while a student tries to predict the actions of the teacher with more limited observations, e.g., in a robot navigation task, the teacher might have access to distances to nearby obstacles, while the student only receives visual observations of the scene. However, privileged imitation learning faces a key challenge: the student might be unable to imitate the teacher's behavior due to partial observability. This problem arises because the teacher is trained without considering if the student is capable of imitating the learned behavior. To address this teacher-student asymmetry, we propose a framework for joint training of the teacher and student policies, encouraging the teacher to learn behaviors that can be imitated by the student despite the latters' limited access to information and its partial observability. Based on the performance bound in imitation learning, we add (i) the approximated action difference between teacher and student as a penalty term to the reward function of the teacher, and (ii) a supervised teacher-student alignment step. We motivate our method with a maze navigation task and demonstrate its effectiveness on complex vision-based quadrotor flight and manipulation tasks."
Poster,Studying the Interplay Between the Actor and Critic Representations in Reinforcement Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28067,"Samuel Garcin, Trevor McInroe, Pablo Samuel Castro, Christopher Lucas, David Abel, Prakash Panangaden, Stefano V. Albrecht","Extracting relevant information from a stream of high-dimensional observations is a central challenge for deep reinforcement learning agents. Actor-critic algorithms add further complexity to this challenge, as it is often unclear whether the same information will be relevant to both the actor and the critic. To this end, we here explore the principles that underlie effective representations for the actor and for the critic in on-policy algorithms. We focus our study on understanding whether the actor and critic will benefit from separate, rather than shared, representations. Our primary finding is that when separated, the representations for the actor and critic systematically specialise in extracting different types of information from the environment---the actor's representation tends to focus on action-relevant information, while the critic's representation specialises in encoding value and dynamics information. We conduct a rigourous empirical study to understand how different representation learning approaches affect the actor and critic's specialisations and their downstream performance, in terms of sample efficiency and generation capabilities. Finally, we discover that a separated critic plays an important role in exploration and data collection during training.

Poster,Style Outweighs Substance: Failure Modes of LLM Judges in Alignment Benchmarking,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29906,"Benjamin Feuer, Micah Goldblum, Teresa Datta, Sanjana Nambiar, Raz Besaleli, Samuel Dooley, Max Cembalest, John P Dickerson","The release of ChatGPT in November 2022 sparked an explosion of interest in post-training and an avalanche of new preference optimization (PO) methods. These methods claim superior alignment by virtue of better correspondence with human pairwise preferences, often measured by LLM-judges. In this work, we attempt to answer the following question -- do LLM-judge preferences translate to progress on other, more concrete metrics for alignment, and if not, why not? We define a concrete metric for alignment, and introduce SOS-Bench (Substance Outweighs Style Benchmark), the largest standardized, reproducible LLM meta-benchmark to date. We find that (1) LLM-judge preferences do not correlate with concrete measures of safety, world knowledge, and instruction following; (2) LLM-judges have powerful implicit biases, prioritizing style over factuality and safety; and (3) the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage of post-training has a large impact on alignment, with data scaling and prompt diversity as the driving factors."
Poster,Subgraph Federated Learning for Local Generalization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29061,"Sungwon Kim, Yoonho Lee, Yunhak Oh, Namkyeong Lee, Sukwon Yun, Junseok Lee, Sein Kim, Carl Yang, Chanyoung Park","Federated Learning (FL) on graphs enables collaborative model training to enhance performance without compromising the privacy of each client. However, existing methods often overlook the mutable nature of graph data, which frequently introduces new nodes and leads to shifts in label distribution. Since they focus solely on performing well on each client's local data, they are prone to overfitting to their local distributions (i.e., local overfitting), which hinders their ability to generalize to unseen data with diverse label distributions. In contrast, our proposed method, FedLoG, effectively tackles this issue by mitigating local overfitting. Our model generates global synthetic data by condensing the reliable information from each class representation and its structural information across clients. Using these synthetic data as a training set, we alleviate the local overfitting problem by adaptively generalizing the absent knowledge within each local dataset. This enhances the generalization capabilities of local models, enabling them to handle unseen data effectively. Our model outperforms baselines in our proposed experimental settings, which are designed to measure generalization power to unseen data in practical scenarios.

Poster,Subtask-Aware Visual Reward Learning from Segmented Demonstrations,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28446,"Changyeon Kim, Minho Heo, Doohyun Lee, Honglak Lee, Jinwoo Shin, Joseph Lim, Kimin Lee","Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents have demonstrated their potential across various robotic tasks. However, they still heavily rely on human-engineered reward functions, requiring extensive trial-and-error and access to target behavior information, often unavailable in real-world settings. This paper introduces REDS: REward learning from Demonstration with Segmentations, a novel reward learning framework that leverages action-free videos with minimal supervision. Specifically, REDS employs video demonstrations segmented into subtasks from diverse sources and treats these segments as ground-truth rewards. We train a dense reward function conditioned on video segments and their corresponding subtasks to ensure alignment with ground-truth reward signals by minimizing the Equivalent-Policy Invariant Comparison distance. Additionally, we employ contrastive learning objectives to align video representations with subtasks, ensuring precise subtask inference during online interactions. Our experiments show that REDS significantly outperforms baseline methods on complex robotic manipulation tasks in Meta-World and more challenging real-world tasks, such as furniture assembly in FurnitureBench, with minimal human intervention. Moreover, REDS facilitates generalization to unseen tasks and robot embodiments, highlighting its potential for scalable deployment in diverse environments."
Poster,Sufficient Context: A New Lens on Retrieval Augmented Generation Systems,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30092,"Hailey Joren, Jianyi Zhang, Chun-Sung Ferng, Da-Cheng Juan, Ankur Taly, Cyrus Rashtchian","Augmenting LLMs with context leads to improved performance across many applications. Despite much research on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, an open question is whether errors arise because LLMs fail to utilize the context from retrieval or the context itself is insufficient to answer the query. To shed light on this, we develop a new notion of sufficient context, along with a method to classify instances that have enough information to answer the query. We then use sufficient context to analyze several models and datasets. By stratifying errors based on context sufficiency, we find that larger models with higher baseline performance (Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT 4o, Claude 3.5) excel at answering queries when the context is sufficient, but often output incorrect answers instead of abstaining when the context is not. On the other hand, smaller models with lower baseline performance (Llama 3.1, Mistral 3, Gemma 2) hallucinate or abstain often, even with sufficient context. We further categorize cases when the context is useful, and improves accuracy, even though it does not fully answer the query and the model errs without the context. Building on our findings, we explore ways to reduce hallucinations in RAG systems, including a new selective generation method that leverages sufficient context information for guided abstention. Our method improves the fraction of correct answers among times where the model responds by 2--10% for Gemini, GPT, and Gemma. Code for our selective generation method and the prompts used in our autorater analysis are available on our [github](https://github.com/hljoren/sufficientcontext)."
Poster,SuperCorrect: Advancing Small LLM Reasoning with Thought Template Distillation and Self-Correction,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29720,"Ling Yang, Zhaochen Yu, Tianjun Zhang, Minkai Xu, Joseph E Gonzalez, Bin CUI, Shuicheng YAN","Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1, and ReasonFlux have shown significant improvements in various reasoning tasks. However, smaller LLMs still struggle with complex mathematical reasoning because they fail to effectively identify and correct reasoning errors. Recent reflection-based methods aim to address these issues by enabling self-reflection and self-correction, but they still face challenges in independently detecting errors in their reasoning steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose SuperCorrect, a novel two-stage framework that uses a large teacher model to supervise and correct both the reasoning and reflection processes of a smaller student model. In the first stage, we extract hierarchical high-level and detailed thought templates from the teacher model to guide the student model in eliciting more fine-grained reasoning thoughts. In the second stage, we introduce cross-model collaborative direct preference optimization (DPO) to enhance the self-correction abilities of the student model by following the teacher's correction traces during training. This cross-model DPO approach teaches the student model to effectively locate and resolve erroneous thoughts with error-driven insights from the teacher model, breaking the bottleneck of its thoughts and acquiring new skills and knowledge to tackle challenging problems. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate our superiority over previous methods. Notably, our SuperCorrect-7B model significantly surpasses powerful DeepSeekMath-7B by 7.8\%/5.3\% and Qwen2.5-Math-7B by 15.1\%/6.3\% on MATH/GSM8K benchmarks, achieving new SOTA performance among all 7B models.
