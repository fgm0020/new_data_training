Poster,GraphBridge: Towards Arbitrary Transfer Learning in GNNs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28805,"Li Ju, Xingyi Yang, Qi Li, Xinchao Wang","Graph neural networks (GNNs) are conventionally trained on a per-domain, per-task basis. It creates a significant barrier in transferring the acquired knowledge to different, heterogeneous data setups. This paper introduces **GraphBridge**, a novel framework to enable knowledge transfer across disparate tasks and domains in GNNs, circumventing the need for modifications to task configurations or graph structures. Specifically, GraphBridge allows for the augmentation of any pre-trained GNN with prediction heads and a bridging network that connects the input to the output layer. This architecture not only preserves the intrinsic knowledge of the original model but also supports outputs of arbitrary dimensions. To mitigate the negative transfer problem, GraphBridge merges the source model with a concurrently trained model, thereby reducing the source bias when applied to the target domain. Our method is thoroughly evaluated across diverse transfer learning scenarios, including Graph2Graph, Node2Node, Graph2Node, and graph2point-cloud. Empirical validation, conducted over 16 datasets representative of these scenarios, confirms the framework's capacity for task- and domain-agnostic transfer learning within graph-like data, marking a significant advancement in the field of GNNs.

Poster,GraphEval: A Lightweight Graph-Based LLM Framework for Idea Evaluation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30947,"Tao Feng, Yihang Sun, Jiaxuan You","The powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their growing use in evaluating human-generated content, particularly in evaluating research ideas within academic settings. Existing solutions primarily rely on prompt-based LLM methods or fine-tuned lightweight language models for idea evaluation. However, these methods are often unstable and struggle to comprehend the complex semantic information embedded in the ideas, impeding their ability to perform high-quality evaluations. To address the above challenges, we propose $\texttt{GraphEval}$, a lightweight graph-based LLM framework for idea evaluation. Our insight is that a complex idea can be broken down into comprehensible viewpoint nodes using prompts from small LLMs. These viewpoint nodes can then be linked together through edges created from LLM-based relation extraction and/or BERT similarity scores. The created viewpoint-graph can be used to conveniently propagate scores across view-nodes to improve the robustness of the idea evaluations. In particular, we propose two lightweight graph-based methods for idea evaluation: (1) GraphEval-LP: a training-free label propagation algorithm that propagates evaluation scores from known view-nodes to unknown nodes; (2) GraphEval-GNN: a Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that is trained to predict the evaluation scores given the observed graph with minimal computation resources. Moreover, to overcome LLM's limitation in objectively assessing the novelty of ideas, we further propose a novelty detection model to GraphEval-GNN to enhance its capability in judging idea novelty. Experiments on two datasets show $\texttt{GraphEval}$ improves F1 scores by at least 14% with low computation and API costs. Additionally, $\texttt{GraphEval}$ can effectively detect plagiarized ideas."
Poster,Graph-Guided Scene Reconstruction from Images with 3D Gaussian Splatting,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30969,"Chong Cheng, Gaochao Song, Yiyang Yao, Qinzheng Zhou, Gangjian Zhang, Hao Wang","This paper investigates an open research challenge of reconstructing high-quality, large-scale 3D open scenes from images. It is observed existing methods have various limitations, such as requiring precise camera poses for input and dense viewpoints for supervision. To perform effective and efficient 3D scene reconstruction, we propose a novel graph-guided 3D scene reconstruction framework, GraphGS. Specifically, given a set of images captured by RGB cameras on a scene, we first design a spatial prior-based scene structure estimation method. This is then used to create a camera graph that includes information about the camera topology. Further, we propose to apply the graph-guided multi-view consistency constraint and adaptive sampling strategy to the 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization process. This greatly alleviates the issue of Gaussian points overfitting to specific sparse viewpoints and expedites the 3D reconstruction process. We demonstrate GraphGS achieves high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from images, which presents state-of-the-art performance through quantitative and qualitative evaluation across multiple datasets."
Poster,Graph Neural Networks Are More Than Filters: Revisiting and Benchmarking from A Spectral Perspective,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28406,"Yushun Dong, Patrick Soga, Yinhan He, Song Wang, Jundong Li","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various graph-based learning tasks. While their performance is often attributed to the powerful neighborhood aggregation mechanism, recent studies suggest that other components such as non-linear layers may also significantly affecting how GNNs process the input graph data in the spectral domain. Such evidence challenges the prevalent opinion that neighborhood aggregation mechanisms dominate the behavioral characteristics of GNNs in the spectral domain. To demystify such a conflict, this paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark to measure and evaluate GNNs' capability in capturing and leveraging the information encoded in different frequency components of the input graph data. Specifically, we first conduct an exploratory study demonstrating that GNNs can flexibly yield outputs with diverse frequency components even when certain frequencies are absent or filtered out from the input graph data. We then formulate a novel research problem of measuring and benchmarking the performance of GNNs from a spectral perspective. To take an initial step towards a comprehensive benchmark, we design an evaluation protocol supported by comprehensive theoretical analysis. Finally, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark on real-world datasets, revealing insights that challenge prevalent opinions from a spectral perspective. We believe that our findings will open new avenues for future advancements in this area. Our implementations can be found at: https://github.com/yushundong/Spectral-benchmark."
Poster,Graph Neural Networks Can (Often) Count Substructures,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28119,"Paolo Pellizzoni, Till Schulz, Karsten Borgwardt","Message passing graph neural networks (GNNs) are known to have limited expressive power in their ability to distinguish some non-isomorphic graphs.Because of this, it is well known that they are unable to detect or count arbitrary graph substructures (i.e., solving the subgraph isomorphism problem), a task that is of great importance for several types of graph-structured data. However, we observe that GNNs are in fact able to count graph patterns quite accurately across several real-world graph datasets.Motivated by this observation, we provide an analysis of the subgraph-counting capabilities of GNNs beyond the worst case, deriving several sufficient conditions for GNNs to be able to count subgraphs and, more importantly, to be able to sample-efficiently learn to count subgraphs. Moreover, we develop novel dynamic programming algorithms for solving the subgraph isomorphism problem on restricted classes of pattern and target graphs, and show that message-passing GNNs can efficiently simulate these dynamic programs. Finally, we empirically validate that our sufficient conditions for GNNs to count subgraphs hold on many real-world datasets, providing a theoretically-grounded explanation to our motivating observations."
Poster,Graph Neural Networks for Edge Signals: Orientation Equivariance and Invariance,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29303,"Dominik Fuchsgruber, Tim Postuvan, Stephan Günnemann, Simon Markus Geisler","Many applications in traffic, civil engineering, or electrical engineering revolve around edge-level signals. Such signals can be categorized as inherently directed, for example, the water flow in a pipe network, and undirected, like the diameter of a pipe. Topological methods model edge signals with inherent direction by representing them relative to a so-called *orientation* assigned to each edge. They can neither model undirected edge signals nor distinguish if an edge itself is directed or undirected. We address these shortcomings by (i) revising the notion of *orientation equivariance* to enable edge direction-aware topological models, (ii) proposing *orientation invariance* as an additional requirement to describe signals without inherent direction, and (iii) developing EIGN, an architecture composed of novel direction-aware edge-level graph shift operators, that provably fulfils the aforementioned desiderata. It is the first work that discusses modeling directed and undirected signals while distinguishing between directed and undirected edges. A comprehensive evaluation shows that EIGN outperforms prior work in edge-level tasks, improving in RMSE on flow simulation tasks by up to 23.5%."
Poster,Graph Neural Networks Gone Hogwild,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29350,"Olga Solodova, Nick Richardson, Deniz Oktay, Ryan P Adams","Graph neural networks (GNNs) appear to be powerful tools to learn state representations for agents in distributed, decentralized multi-agent systems, but generate catastrophically incorrect predictions when nodes update asynchronously during inference.  This failure under asynchrony effectively excludes these architectures from many potential applications where synchrony is difficult or impossible to enforce, e.g., robotic swarms or sensor networks.  In this work we identify ''implicitly-defined'' GNNs as a class of architectures which is provably robust to asynchronous ''hogwild'' inference, adapting convergence guarantees from work in asynchronous and distributed optimization.   We then propose a novel implicitly-defined GNN architecture, which we call an energy GNN.   We show that this architecture outperforms other GNNs from this class on a variety of synthetic tasks inspired by multi-agent systems."
Poster,Graph Neural Preconditioners for Iterative Solutions of Sparse Linear Systems,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29521,Jie Chen,"Preconditioning is at the heart of iterative solutions of large, sparse linear systems of equations in scientific disciplines. Several algebraic approaches, which access no information beyond the matrix itself, are widely studied and used, but ill-conditioned matrices remain very challenging. We take a machine learning approach and propose using graph neural networks as a general-purpose preconditioner. They show attractive performance for many problems and can be used when the mainstream preconditioners perform poorly. Empirical evaluation on over 800 matrices suggests that the construction time of these graph neural preconditioners (GNPs) is more predictable and can be much shorter than that of other widely used ones, such as ILU and AMG, while the execution time is faster than using a Krylov method as the preconditioner, such as in inner-outer GMRES. GNPs have a strong potential for solving large-scale, challenging algebraic problems arising from not only partial differential equations, but also economics, statistics, graph, and optimization, to name a few."
Poster,Graph Neural Ricci Flow: Evolving Feature from a Curvature Perspective,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30813,"Jialong Chen, Bowen Deng, Zhen WANG, Chuan Chen, Zibin Zheng","Differential equations provide a dynamical perspective for understanding and designing graph neural networks (GNNs). By generalizing the discrete Ricci flow (DRF) to attributed graphs, we can leverage a new paradigm for the evolution of node features with the help of curvature. We show that in the attributed graphs, DRF guarantees a vital property: The curvature of each edge concentrates toward zero over time. This property leads to two interesting consequences: 1) graph Dirichlet energy with bilateral bounds and 2) data-independent curvature decay rate. Based on these theoretical results, we propose the Graph Neural Ricci Flow (GNRF), a novel curvature-aware continuous-depth GNN. Compared to traditional curvature-based graph learning methods, GNRF is not limited to a specific curvature definition. It computes and adjusts time-varying curvature efficiently in linear time. We also empirically illustrate the operating mechanism of GNRF and verify that it performs excellently on diverse datasets."
Poster,GraphRouter: A Graph-based Router for LLM Selections,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28926,"Tao Feng, Yanzhen Shen, Jiaxuan You","The rapidly growing number and variety of Large Language Models (LLMs)present significant challenges in efficiently selecting the appropriate LLM fora given query, especially considering the trade-offs between performance andcomputational cost. Current LLM selection methods often struggle to generalizeacross new LLMs and different tasks because of their limited ability to leveragecontextual interactions among tasks, queries, and LLMs, as well as their depen-dence on a transductive learning framework. To address these shortcomings, weintroduce a novel inductive graph framework, named as GraphRouter, whichfully utilizes the contextual information among tasks, queries, and LLMs to en-hance the LLM selection process. GraphRouter constructs a heterogeneousgraph comprising task, query, and LLM nodes, with interactions represented asedges, which efficiently captures the contextual information between the query’srequirements and the LLM’s capabilities. Through an innovative edge predictionmechanism, GraphRouter is able to predict attributes (the effect and cost ofLLM response) of potential edges, allowing for optimized recommendations thatadapt to both existing and newly introduced LLMs without requiring retraining.Comprehensive experiments across three distinct effect-cost weight scenarios haveshown that GraphRouter substantially surpasses existing routers, delivering aminimum performance improvement of 12.3%. In addition, it achieves enhancedgeneralization across new LLMs settings and supports diverse tasks with at least a9.5% boost in effect and a significant reduction in computational demands. Thiswork endeavors to apply a graph-based approach for the contextual and adaptiveselection of LLMs, offering insights for real-world applications."
