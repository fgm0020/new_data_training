Poster,PIED: Physics-Informed Experimental Design for Inverse Problems,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27871,"Apivich Hemachandra, Gregory Kang Ruey Lau, See-Kiong Ng, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low","In many science and engineering settings, system dynamics are characterized by governing partial differential equations (PDEs), and a major challenge is to solve inverse problems (IPs) where unknown PDE parameters are inferred based on observational data gathered under limited budget. Due to the high costs of setting up and running experiments, experimental design (ED) is often done with the help of PDE simulations to optimize for the most informative design parameters (e.g., sensor placements) to solve such IPs, prior to actual data collection. This process of optimizing design parameters is especially critical when the budget and other practical constraints make it infeasible to adjust the design parameters between trials during the experiments.However, existing experimental design (ED) methods tend to require sequential and frequent design parameter adjustments between trials. Furthermore, they also have significant computational bottlenecks due to the need for complex numerical simulations for PDEs, and do not exploit the advantages provided by physics informed neural networks (PINNs) in solving IPs for PDE-governed systems, such as its meshless solutions, differentiability, and amortized training. This work presents Physics-Informed Experimental Design (PIED), the first ED framework that makes use of PINNs in a fully differentiable architecture to perform continuous optimization of design parameters for IPs for one-shot deployments. PIED overcomes existing methods' computational bottlenecks through parallelized computation and meta-learning of PINN parameter initialization, and proposes novel methods to effectively take into account PINN training dynamics in optimizing the ED parameters. Through experiments based on noisy simulated data and even real world experimental data, we empirically show that given limited observation budget, PIED significantly outperforms existing ED methods in solving IPs, including for challenging settings where the inverse parameters are unknown functions rather than just finite-dimensional."
Poster,PIG: Physics-Informed Gaussians as Adaptive Parametric Mesh Representations,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27752,"Namgyu Kang, Jaemin Oh, Youngjoon Hong, Eunbyung Park","The numerical approximation of partial differential equations (PDEs) using neural networks has seen significant advancements through Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Despite their straightforward optimization framework and flexibility in implementing various PDEs, PINNs often suffer from limited accuracy due to the spectral bias of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), which struggle to effectively learn high-frequency and nonlinear components. Recently, parametric mesh representations in combination with neural networks have been investigated as a promising approach to eliminate the inductive bias of MLPs. However, they usually require high-resolution grids and a large number of collocation points to achieve high accuracy while avoiding overfitting. In addition, the fixed positions of the mesh parameters restrict their flexibility, making accurate approximation of complex PDEs challenging. To overcome these limitations, we propose Physics-Informed Gaussians (PIGs), which combine feature embeddings using Gaussian functions with a lightweight neural network. Our approach uses trainable parameters for the mean and variance of each Gaussian, allowing for dynamic adjustment of their positions and shapes during training. This adaptability enables our model to optimally approximate PDE solutions, unlike models with fixed parameter positions. Furthermore, the proposed approach maintains the same optimization framework used in PINNs, allowing us to benefit from their excellent properties. Experimental results show the competitive performance of our model across various PDEs, demonstrating its potential as a robust tool for solving complex PDEs.

Poster,PINP: Physics-Informed Neural Predictor with latent estimation of fluid flows,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27928,"Huaguan Chen, Yang Liu, Hao Sun","Accurately predicting fluid dynamics and evolution has been a long-standing challenge in physical sciences. Conventional deep learning methods often rely on the nonlinear modeling capabilities of neural networks to establish mappings between past and future states, overlooking the fluid dynamics, or only modeling the velocity field, neglecting the coupling of multiple physical quantities. In this paper, we propose a new physics-informed learning approach that incorporates coupled physical quantities into the prediction process to assist with forecasting. Central to our method lies in the discretization of physical equations, which are directly integrated into the model architecture and loss function. This integration enables the model to provide robust, long-term future predictions. By incorporating physical equations, our model demonstrates temporal extrapolation and spatial generalization capabilities. Experimental results show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance in spatiotemporal prediction across both numerical simulations and real-world extreme-precipitation nowcasting benchmarks."
Poster,PIN: Prolate Spheroidal Wave Function-based Implicit Neural Representations,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30391,"Viraj Dhananjaya Bandara Jayasundara Jayasundara Mudiyanselage, Heng Zhao, Demetrio Labate, Vishal Patel","Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) provide a continuous mapping between the coordinates of a signal and the corresponding values. As the performance of INRs heavily depends on the choice of nonlinear-activation functions, there has been a significant focus on encoding explicit signals within INRs using diverse activation functions. Despite recent advancements, existing INRs often encounter significant challenges, particularly at fine scales where they often introduce noise-like artifacts over smoother areas compromising the quality of the output. Moreover, they frequently struggle to generalize to unseen coordinates. These drawbacks highlight a critical area for further research and development to enhance the robustness and applicability of INRs across diverse scenarios. To address this challenge, we introduce the Prolate Spheroidal Wave Function-based Implicit Neural Representations (PIN), which exploits the optimal space-frequency domain concentration of Prolate Spheroidal Wave Functions (PSWFs) as the nonlinear mechanism in INRs. Our experimental results reveal that PIN excels not only in representing images and 3D shapes but also significantly outperforms existing methods in various vision tasks that require INR generalization, including image inpainting, novel view synthesis, edge detection, and image denoising."
Poster,PIORF: Physics-Informed Ollivier-Ricci Flow for Long–Range Interactions in Mesh Graph Neural Networks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28238,"Youn-Yeol Yu, Jeongwhan Choi, Jaehyeon Park, Kookjin Lee, Noseong Park","Recently, data-driven simulators based on graph neural networks have gained attention in modeling physical systems on unstructured meshes. However, they struggle with long-range dependencies in fluid flows, particularly in refined mesh regions. This challenge, known as the 'over-squashing' problem, hinders information propagation. While existing graph rewiring methods address this issue to some extent, they only consider graph topology, overlooking the underlying physical phenomena. We propose Physics-Informed Ollivier--Ricci Flow (PIORF), a novel rewiring method that combines physical correlations with graph topology. PIORF uses Ollivier--Ricci curvature (ORC) to identify bottleneck regions and connects these areas with nodes in high-velocity gradient nodes, enabling long-range interactions and mitigating over-squashing. Our approach is computationally efficient in rewiring edges and can scale to larger simulations. Experimental results on 3 fluid dynamics benchmark datasets show that PIORF consistently outperforms baseline models and existing rewiring methods, achieving up to 26.2\% improvement."
Poster,Pitfalls of Evidence-Based AI Policy,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31363,"Stephen Casper, David Krueger, Dylan Hadfield-Menell","Nations across the world are working to govern AI. However, from a technical perspective, the best way to do this is not yet clear. Meanwhile, recent debates over AI regulation have led to calls for “evidence-based AI policy” which emphasize holding regulatory action to a high evidentiary standard. Evidence is of irreplaceable value to policymaking. However, holding regulatory action to too high an evidentiary standard can lead to systematic neglect of certain risks. In historical policy debates (e.g., over tobacco ca. 1965 and fossil fuels ca. 1990) “evidence-based policy” rhetoric is also a well-precedented strategy to downplay the urgency of action, delay regulation, and protect industry interests. Here, we argue that if the goal is evidence-based AI policy, the first regulatory objective must be to actively facilitate the process of identifying, studying, and deliberating about AI risks. We discuss a set of 16 regulatory goals to facilitate this and show that the EU, UK, USA, Brazil, Canada, and China all have substantial opportunities to adopt further evidence-seeking policies."
Poster,PivotMesh: Generic 3D Mesh Generation via Pivot Vertices Guidance,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29379,"Haohan Weng, Yikai Wang, Tong Zhang, C. L. Philip Chen, Jun Zhu","Generating compact and sharply detailed 3D meshes poses a significant challenge for current 3D generative models. Different from extracting dense meshes from neural representation, some recent works try to model the native mesh distribution (i.e., a set of triangles), which generates more compact results as humans crafted. However, due to the complexity and variety of mesh topology, most of these methods are typically limited to generating meshes with simple geometry. In this paper, we introduce a generic and scalable mesh generation framework PivotMesh, which makes an initial attempt to extend the native mesh generation to large-scale datasets. We employ a transformer-based autoencoder to encode meshes into discrete tokens and decode them from face level to vertex level hierarchically. Subsequently, to model the complex typology, our model first learns to generate pivot vertices as coarse mesh representation and then generate the complete mesh tokens with the same auto-regressive Transformer. This reduces the difficulty compared with directly modeling the mesh distribution and further improves the model controllability. PivotMesh demonstrates its versatility by effectively learning from both small datasets like Shapenet, and large-scale datasets like Objaverse and Objaverse-xl. Extensive experiments indicate that PivotMesh can generate compact and sharp 3D meshes across various categories, highlighting its great potential for native mesh modeling."
Poster,PixWizard: Versatile Image-to-Image Visual Assistant with Open-Language Instructions,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/32047,"Weifeng Lin, Xinyu Wei, Renrui Zhang, Le Zhuo, Shitian Zhao, Siyuan Huang, Junlin Xie, Gao Peng, Hongsheng Li","This paper presents a versatile image-to-image visual assistant, PixWizard, designed for image generation, manipulation, and translation based on free-from language instructions. To this end, we tackle a variety of vision tasks into a unified image-text-to-image generation framework and curate an Omni Pixel-to-Pixel Instruction-Tuning Dataset. By constructing detailed instruction templates in natural language, we comprehensively include a large set of diverse vision tasks such as text-to-image generation, image restoration, image grounding, dense image prediction, image editing, controllable generation, inpainting/outpainting, and more. Furthermore, we adopt Diffusion Transformers (DiT) as our foundation model and extend its capabilities with a flexible any resolution mechanism, enabling the model to dynamically process images based on the aspect ratio of the input, closely aligning with human perceptual processes. The model also incorporates structure-aware and semantic-aware guidance to facilitate effective fusion of information from the input image. Our experiments demonstrate that PixWizard not only shows impressive generative and understanding  abilities for images with diverse resolutions but also exhibits generalization capabilities with unseen tasks and human instructions."
Poster,Planning Anything with Rigor: General-Purpose Zero-Shot Planning with LLM-based Formalized Programming,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31260,"Yilun Hao, Yang Zhang, Chuchu Fan","While large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in solving planning problems, there is a trade-off between flexibility and complexity. LLMs, as zero-shot planners themselves, are still not capable of directly generating valid plans for complex planning problems such as multi-constraint or long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, many frameworks aiming to solve complex planning problems often rely on task-specific preparatory efforts, such as task-specific in-context examples and pre-defined critics/verifiers, which limits their cross-task generalization capability. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by observing that the core of many planning problems lies in optimization problems: searching for the optimal solution (best plan) with goals subject to constraints (preconditions and effects of decisions). With LLMs' commonsense, reasoning, and programming capabilities, this opens up the possibilities of a universal LLM-based approach to planning problems. Inspired by this observation, we propose LLMFP, a general-purpose framework that leverages LLMs to capture key information from planning problems and formally formulate and solve them as optimization problems from scratch, with no task-specific examples needed. We apply LLMFP to 9 planning problems, ranging from multi-constraint decision making to multi-step planning problems, and demonstrate that LLMFP achieves on average 83.7\% and 86.8\% optimal rate across 9 tasks for GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming the best baseline (direct planning with OpenAI o1-preview) with 37.6\% and 40.7\% improvements. We also validate components of LLMFP with ablation experiments and analyzed the underlying success and failure reasons."
Poster,Planning in Natural Language Improves LLM Search for Code Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31034,"Evan Wang, Federico Cassano, Catherine Wu, Yunfeng Bai, William Song, Vaskar Nath, Ziwen Han, Sean Hendryx, Summer Yue, Hugh Zhang","While scaling training compute has led to remarkable improvements in large language models (LLMs), scaling inference compute only recently began to yield analogous gains. We hypothesize that a core missing component is a lack of diverse LLM outputs, leading to inefficient search due to models repeatedly sampling highly similar, yet incorrect generations. We empirically demonstrate that this lack of diversity can be mitigated by searching over candidate plans for solving a problem in natural language. Based on this insight, we propose PlanSearch, a novel search algorithm which shows strong results across HumanEval+, MBPP+, and LiveCodeBench (a contamination-free benchmark for competitive coding). PlanSearch generates a diverse set of observations about the problem and uses these observations to construct plans for solving the problem. By searching over plans in natural language rather than directly over code solutions, PlanSearch explores a significantly more diverse range of potential solutions compared to baseline search methods. Using PlanSearch on top of Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves a pass@200 of 77.0% on LiveCodeBench, outperforming both the best pass-rate achieved without any search (pass@1 = 41.4%) and using standard repeated sampling on top of existing non-search models (pass@200 = 60.6%). Finally, we show that, across all models, search algorithms, and benchmarks analyzed, we can accurately predict performance gains from search as a function of the diversity over generated ideas."
