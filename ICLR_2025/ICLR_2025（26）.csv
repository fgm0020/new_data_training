Poster,A Simple yet Effective $\Delta\Delta G$ Predictor is An Unsupervised Antibody Optimizer and Explainer,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30140,"Lirong Wu, Yunfan Liu, Haitao Lin, Yufei Huang, Guojiang Zhao, Zhifeng Gao, Stan Z Li","The proteins that exist today have been optimized over billions of years of natural evolution, during which nature creates random mutations and selects them. The discovery of functionally promising mutations is challenged by the limited evolutionary accessible regions, i.e., only a small region on the fitness landscape is beneficial. There have been numerous priors used to constrain protein evolution to regions of landscapes with high-fitness variants, among which the change in binding free energy ($\Delta\Delta G$) of protein complexes upon mutations is one of the most commonly used priors. However, the huge mutation space poses two challenges: (1) how to improve the efficiency of $\Delta\Delta G$ prediction for fast mutation screening; and (2) how to explain mutation preferences and efficiently explore accessible evolutionary regions. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight $\Delta\Delta G$ predictor (Light-DDG), which adopts a structure-aware Transformer as the backbone and enhances it by knowledge distilled from existing powerful but computationally heavy $\Delta\Delta G$ predictors. Additionally, we augmented, annotated, and released a large-scale dataset containing millions of mutation data for pre-training Light-DDG. We find that such a simple yet effective Light-DDG can serve as a good unsupervised antibody optimizer and explainer. For the target antibody, we propose a novel Mutation Explainer to learn mutation preferences, which accounts for the marginal benefit of each mutation per residue. To further explore accessible evolutionary regions, we conduct preference-guided antibody optimization and evaluate antibody candidates quickly using Light-DDG to identify desirable mutations. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of Light-DDG in terms of test generalizability, noise robustness, and inference practicality, e.g., 89.7$\times$ inference acceleration and 15.45\% performance gains over previous state-of-the-art baselines. A case study of SARS-CoV-2 further demonstrates the crucial role of Light-DDG for mutation explanation and antibody optimization."
Poster,"A Single Goal is All You Need: Skills and Exploration Emerge from Contrastive RL without Rewards, Demonstrations, or Subgoals",https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27798,"Grace Liu, Michael Tang, Benjamin Eysenbach","In this paper, we present empirical evidence of skills and directed exploration emerging from a simple RL algorithm long before any successful trials are observed. For example, in a manipulation task, the agent is given a single observation of the goal state (see Fig. 1) and learns skills, first for moving its end-effector, then for pushing the block, and finally for picking up and placing the block. These skills emerge before the agent has ever successfully placed the block at the goal location and without the aid of any reward functions, demonstrations, or manually-specified distance metrics. Once the agent has learned to reach the goal state reliably, exploration is reduced. Implementing our method involves a simple modification of prior work and does not require density estimates, ensembles, or any additional hyperparameters. Intuitively, the proposed method seems like it should be terrible at exploration, and we lack a clear theoretical understanding of why it works so effectively, though our experiments provide some hints."
Poster,"Ask, and it shall be given: On the Turing completeness of prompting",https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30632,"Ruizhong Qiu, Zhe Xu, Wenxuan Bao, Hanghang Tong","Since the success of GPT, large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized machine learning and have initiated the so-called *LLM prompting* paradigm. In the era of LLMs, people train a single general-purpose LLM and provide the LLM with different *prompts* to perform different tasks. However, such empirical success largely lacks theoretical understanding. Here, we present the first theoretical study on the LLM prompting paradigm to the best of our knowledge. In this work, we show that prompting is in fact Turing-complete: there exists a finite-size Transformer such that for any computable function, there exists a corresponding prompt following which the Transformer computes the function. Furthermore, we show that even though we use only a single finite-size Transformer, it can still achieve nearly the same complexity bounds as that of the class of all unbounded-size Transformers. Overall, our result reveals that prompting can enable a single finite-size Transformer to be efficiently universal, which establishes a theoretical underpinning for prompt engineering in practice."
Poster,A Skewness-Based Criterion for Addressing Heteroscedastic Noise in Causal Discovery,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27676,"Yingyu Lin, Yuxing Huang, Wenqin Liu, Haoran Deng, Ignavier Ng, Kun Zhang, Mingming Gong, Yian Ma, Biwei Huang","Real-world data often violates the equal-variance assumption (homoscedasticity), making it essential to account for heteroscedastic noise in causal discovery. In this work, we explore heteroscedastic symmetric noise models (HSNMs), where the effect $Y$ is modeled as $Y = f(X) + \sigma(X)N$, with $X$ as the cause and $N$ as independent noise following a symmetric distribution. We introduce a novel criterion for identifying HSNMs based on the skewness of the score (i.e., the gradient of the log density) of the data distribution. This criterion establishes a computationally tractable measurement that is zero in the causal direction but nonzero in the anticausal direction, enabling the causal direction discovery. We extend this skewness-based criterion to the multivariate setting and propose \texttt{SkewScore}, an algorithm that handles heteroscedastic noise without requiring the extraction of exogenous noise. We also conduct a case study on the robustness of \texttt{SkewScore} in a bivariate model with a latent confounder, providing theoretical insights into its performance. Empirical studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
Poster,As large as it gets – Studying Infinitely Large Convolutions via Neural Implicit Frequency Filters,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31487,"Margret Keuper, Julia Grabinski, Janis Keuper","Recent work in neural networks for image classification has seen a strong tendency towards increasing the spatial context during encoding. Whether achieved through large convolution kernels or self-attention, models scale poorly with the increased spatial context, such that the improved model accuracy often comes at significant costs. In this paper, we propose a module for studying the effective filter size of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To facilitate such a study, several challenges need to be addressed: (i) we need an effective means to train models with large filters (potentially as large as the input data) without increasing the number of learnable parameters, (ii) the employed convolution operation should be a plug-and-play module that can replace conventional convolutions in a CNN and allow for an efficient implementation in current frameworks, (iii) the study of filter sizes has to be decoupled from other aspects such as the network width or the number of learnable parameters, and (iv) the cost of the convolution operation itself has to remain manageable i.e.~we can not naïvely increase the size of the convolution kernel. To address these challenges, we propose to learn the frequency representations of filter weights as neural implicit functions, such that the better scalability of the convolution in the frequency domain can be leveraged. Additionally, due to the implementation of the proposed neural implicit function, even large and expressive spatial filters can be parameterized by only a few learnable weights. Interestingly, our analysis shows that, although the proposed networks could learn very large convolution kernels, the learned filters are well localized and relatively small in practice when transformed from the frequency to the spatial domain. We anticipate that our analysis of individually optimized filter sizes will allow for more efficient, yet effective, models in the future. Our code is available at https://github.com/GeJulia/NIFF ."
Poster,A Solvable Attention for Neural Scaling Laws,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27834,"Bochen Lyu, Di Wang, Zhanxing Zhu","Transformers and many other deep learning models are empirically shown to predictably enhance their performance as a power law in training time, model size, or the number of training data points, which is termed as the neural scaling law. This paper studies this intriguing phenomenon particularly for the transformer architecture in theoretical setups. Specifically, we propose a framework for linear self-attention, the underpinning block of transformer without softmax, to learn in an in-context manner, where the corresponding learning dynamics is modeled as a non-linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) system. Furthermore, we establish a procedure to derive a tractable approximate solution for this ODE system by reformulating it as a *Riccati equation*, which allows us to precisely characterize neural scaling laws for linear self-attention with training time, model size, data size, and the optimal compute. In addition, we reveal that the linear self-attention shares similar neural scaling laws with several other architectures when the context sequence length of the in-context learning is fixed, otherwise it would exhibit a different scaling law of training time."
Poster,A Spark of Vision-Language Intelligence: 2-Dimensional Autoregressive Transformer for Efficient Finegrained Image Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27817,"Liang Chen, Sinan Tan, Zefan Cai, Weichu Xie, Haozhe Zhao, Yichi Zhang, Junyang Lin, Jinze Bai, Tianyu Liu, Baobao Chang","This work tackles the information loss bottleneck of vector-quantization (VQ) autoregressive image generation by introducing a novel model architecture called the 2-Dimensional Autoregression (DnD) Transformer. The DnD-Transformer predicts more codes for an image by introducing a new direction, **model depth**, along with the sequence length. Compared to 1D autoregression and previous work using similar 2D image decomposition such as RQ-Transformer, the DnD-Transformer is an end-to-end model that can generate higher quality images with the same backbone model size and sequence length, opening a new optimization perspective for autoregressive image generation. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that the DnD-Transformer's potential extends beyond generating natural images. It can even generate images with rich text and graphical elements in a self-supervised manner, demonstrating an understanding of these combined modalities. This has not been previously demonstrated for popular vision generative models such as diffusion models, showing a spark of vision-language intelligence when trained solely on images. Code, datasets and models are open at https://github.com/chenllliang/DnD-Transformer."
Poster,AssembleFlow: Rigid Flow Matching with Inertial Frames for Molecular Assembly,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28629,"Hongyu Guo, Yoshua Bengio, Shengchao Liu","Molecular assembly, where a cluster of rigid molecules aggregated into strongly correlated forms, is fundamental to determining the properties of materials. However, traditional numerical methods for simulating this process are computationally expensive, and existing generative models on material generation overlook the rigidity inherent in molecular structures, leading to unwanted distortions and invalid internal structures in molecules. To address this, we introduce AssembleFlow. AssembleFlow leverages inertial frames to establish reference coordinate systems at the molecular level for tracking the orientation and motion of molecules within the cluster. It further decomposes molecular $\text{SE}(3)$ transformations into translations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and rotations in $\text{SO}(3)$, enabling explicit enforcement of both translational and rotational rigidity during each generation step within the flow matching framework. This decomposition also empowers distinct probability paths for each transformation group, effectively allowing for the separate learning of their velocity functions: the former, moving in Euclidean space, uses linear interpolation (LERP), while the latter, evolving in spherical space, employs spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) with a closed-form solution. Empirical validation on the benchmarking data COD-Cluster17 shows that AssembleFlow significantly outperforms six competitive deep learning baselines by at least 45\% in assembly matching scores while maintaining 100\% molecular integrity. Also, it matches the assembly performance of a widely used domain-specific simulation tool while reducing computational cost by 25-fold."
Poster,As Simple as Fine-tuning: LLM Alignment via Bidirectional Negative Feedback Loss,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28849,"Xin Mao, Huimin Xu, Feng-Lin Li, Ziqi Jin, WANG CHEN, Wei Zhang, Anh Tuan Luu","Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a more computationally efficient alternative to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), eliminating the need for reward models and online sampling. Despite these benefits, DPO and its variants remain sensitive to hyper-parameters and prone to instability, particularly on mathematical datasets. We argue that these issues arise from the unidirectional likelihood-derivative negative feedback inherent in the log-likelihood loss function.To address this, we propose a novel LLM alignment loss that establishes a stable Bidirectional Negative Feedback (BNF) during optimization. Our proposed BNF loss eliminates the need for pairwise contrastive losses and does not require any extra tunable hyper-parameters or pairwise preference data, streamlining the alignment pipeline to be as simple as supervised fine-tuning.We conduct extensive experiments across two challenging QA benchmarks and four reasoning benchmarks. The experimental results show that BNF achieves comparable performance to the best methods on QA benchmarks, while its performance decrease on the four reasoning benchmarks is significantly lower compared to the best methods, thus striking a better balance between value alignment and reasoning ability. In addition, we further validate the performance of BNF on non-pairwise datasets, and conduct in-depth analysis of log-likelihood and logit shifts across different preference optimization methods.We will release all the source code, checkpoints, and datasets on GitHub."
Poster,Associative memory and dead neurons,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28453,"Vladimir Fanaskov, Ivan Oseledets","In ``Large Associative Memory Problem in Neurobiology and Machine Learning,'' Dmitry Krotov and John Hopfield introduced a general technique for the systematic construction of neural ordinary differential equations with non-increasing energy or Lyapunov function. We study this energy function and identify that it is vulnerable to the problem of dead neurons. Each point in the state space where the neuron dies is contained in a non-compact region with constant energy. In these flat regions, energy function alone does not completely determine all degrees of freedom and, as a consequence, can not be used to analyze stability or find steady states or basins of attraction. We perform a direct analysis of the dynamical system and show how to resolve problems caused by flat directions corresponding to dead neurons: (i) all information about the state vector at a fixed point can be extracted from the energy and Hessian matrix (of Lagrange function), (ii) it is enough to analyze stability in the range of Hessian matrix, (iii) if steady state touching flat region is stable the whole flat region is the basin of attraction. The analysis of the Hessian matrix can be complicated for realistic architectures, so we show that for a slightly altered dynamical system (with the same structure of steady states), one can derive a diverse family of Lyapunov functions that do not have flat regions corresponding to dead neurons. In addition, these energy functions allow one to use Lagrange functions with Hessian matrices that are not necessarily positive definite and even consider architectures with non-symmetric feedforward and feedback connections."
