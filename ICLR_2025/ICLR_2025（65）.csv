Poster,Connectome Mapping: Shape-Memory Network via Interpretation of Contextual Semantic Information,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29747,"Kyungsu Lee, Haeyun Lee, Jae Youn Hwang","Contextual semantic information plays a pivotal role in the brain's visual interpretation of the surrounding environment. When processing visual information, electrical signals within synapses facilitate the dynamic activation and deactivation of synaptic connections, guided by the contextual semantic information associated with different objects. In the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI), neural networks have emerged as powerful tools to emulate complex signaling systems, enabling tasks such as classification and segmentation by understanding visual information. However, conventional neural networks have limitations in simulating the conditional activation and deactivation of synapses, collectively known as the connectome, a comprehensive map of neural connections in the brain. Additionally, the pixel-wise inference mechanism of conventional neural networks failed to account for the explicit utilization of contextual semantic information in the prediction process. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel neural network, dubbed the Shape Memory Network (SMN), which excels in two key areas: (1) faithfully emulating the intricate mechanism of the brain's connectome, and (2) explicitly incorporating contextual semantic information during the inference process. The SMN memorizes the structure suitable for contextual semantic information and leverages this structure at the inference phase. The structural transformation emulates the conditional activation and deactivation of synaptic connections within the connectome. Rigorous experimentation carried out across a range of semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrated the outstanding performance of the SMN, highlighting its superiority and effectiveness. Furthermore, our pioneering network on connectome emulation reveals the immense potential of the SMN for next-generation neural networks."
Poster,Conservative Contextual Bandits: Beyond Linear Representations,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29601,"Rohan Deb, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Arindam Banerjee","Conservative Contextual Bandits (CCBs) address safety in sequential decision making by requiring that an agent's policy, along with minimizing regret, also satisfies a safety constraint: the performance is not worse than a baseline policy (e.g., the policy that the company has in production) by more than $(1+\alpha)$ factor. Prior work developed UCB-stylealgorithms for this problem in the multi-armed (Wu et al., 2016)  and contextuallinear (Kazerouni et al., 2017) settings.However, in practice the cost of the armsis often a non-linear function, and therefore existing UCB algorithms are ineffective in such settings. In this paper, we consider CCBs beyond the linear case and develop two algorithms $\mathtt{C\text{-}SquareCB}$ and $\mathtt{C\text{-}FastCB}$, using Inverse Gap Weighting (IGW) based exploration and an online regression oracle. We show that the safety constraint is satisfied in high probability and that the regret for $\mathtt{C\text{-}SquareCB}$ is sub-linear in horizon $T$, while the the regret for $\mathtt{C\text{-}FastCB}$ is first-order and is sub-linear in $L^*$, the cumulative loss of the optimal policy. Subsequently, we use a neural network for function approximation and online gradient descent as the regression oracle to provide $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(\sqrt{KT} + K/\alpha\big) $ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(\sqrt{KL^*} + K (1 + 1/\alpha)\big)$ regret bounds respectively. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms on real world data, and show that they significantly outperform the existing baseline while maintaining the performance guarantee."
Poster,Consistency Checks for Language Model Forecasters,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28220,"Daniel Paleka, Abhimanyu Pallavi Sudhir, Alejandro Alvarez, Vineeth Bhat, Adam Shen, Evan Wang, Florian Tramer","Forecasting is a task that is difficult to evaluate: the ground truth can only be known in the future. Recent work showing LLM forecasters rapidly approaching human-level performance begs the question: how can we benchmark and evaluate these forecasters *instantaneously*? Following the consistency check framework, we measure the performance of forecasters in terms of the consistency of their predictions on different logically-related questions. We propose a new, general consistency metric based on *arbitrage*: for example, if a forecasting AI illogically predicts that both the Democratic and Republican parties have 60\% probability of winning the 2024 US presidential election, an arbitrageur could trade against the forecaster's predictions and make a profit. We build an automated evaluation system that generates a set of base questions, instantiates consistency checks from these questions, elicits the predictions of the forecaster, and measures the consistency of the predictions. We then build a standard, proper-scoring-rule forecasting benchmark, and show that our (instantaneous) consistency metrics correlate strongly with LLM forecasters' ground truth Brier scores (which are only known in the future). We also release a consistency benchmark that resolves in 2028, providing a long-term evaluation tool for forecasting."
Poster,Consistency Models Made Easy,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27780,"Zhengyang Geng, Ashwini Pokle, Weijian Luo, Justin Lin, Zico Kolter","Consistency models (CMs) offer faster sampling than traditional diffusion models, but their training is resource-intensive. For example, as of 2024, training a state-of-the-art CM on CIFAR-10 takes one week on 8 GPUs. In this work, we propose an effective scheme for training CMs that largely improves the efficiency of building such models. Specifically, by expressing CM trajectories via a particular differential equation, we argue that diffusion models can be viewed as a special case of CMs. We can thus fine-tune a consistency model starting from a pretrained diffusion model and progressively approximate the full consistency condition to stronger degrees over the training process. Our resulting method, which we term Easy Consistency Tuning (ECT), achieves vastly reduced training times while improving upon the quality of previous methods: for example, ECT achieves a 2-step FID of 2.73 on CIFAR10 within 1 hour on a single A100 GPU, matching Consistency Distillation trained for hundreds of GPU hours. Owing to this computational efficiency, we investigate the scaling laws of CMs under ECT, showing that they obey the classic power law scaling, hinting at their ability to improve efficiency and performance at larger scales. Our [code](https://github.com/locuslab/ect) is available."
Poster,Consistent Flow Distillation for Text-to-3D Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30650,"runjie yan, Yinbo Chen, Xiaolong Wang","Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) has made significant strides in distilling image-generative models for 3D generation. However, its maximum-likelihood-seeking behavior often leads to degraded visual quality and diversity, limiting its effectiveness in 3D applications. In this work, we propose Consistent Flow Distillation (CFD), which addresses these limitations. We begin by leveraging the gradient of the diffusion ODE or SDE sampling process to guide the 3D generation. From the gradient-based sampling perspective, we find that the consistency of 2D image flows across different viewpoints is important for high-quality 3D generation. To achieve this, we introduce multi-view consistent Gaussian noise on the 3D object, which can be rendered from various viewpoints to compute the flow gradient. Our experiments demonstrate that CFD, through consistent flows, significantly outperforms previous methods in text-to-3D generation."
Poster,Constraint-Conditioned Actor-Critic for Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28392,"Zijian Guo, Weichao Zhou, Shengao Wang, Wenchao Li","Offline safe reinforcement learning (OSRL) aims to learn policies with high rewards while satisfying safety constraints solely from data collected offline. However, the learned policies often struggle to handle states and actions that are not present or out-of-distribution (OOD) from the offline dataset, which can result in violation of the safety constraints or overly conservative behaviors during their online deployment. Moreover, many existing methods are unable to learn policies that can adapt to varying constraint thresholds. To address these challenges, we propose constraint-conditioned actor-critic (CCAC), a novel OSRL method that models the relationship between state-action distributions and safety constraints, and leverages this relationship to regularize critics and policy learning. CCAC learns policies that can effectively handle OOD data and adapt to varying constraint thresholds. Empirical evaluations on the $\texttt{DSRL}$ benchmarks show that CCAC significantly outperforms existing methods for learning adaptive, safe, and high-reward policies."
Poster,Constructing Confidence Intervals for Average Treatment Effects from Multiple Datasets,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30580,"Yuxin Wang, Maresa Schröder, Dennis Frauen, Jonas Schweisthal, Konstantin Hess, Stefan Feuerriegel","Constructing confidence intervals (CIs) for the average treatment effect (ATE) from patient records is crucial to assess the effectiveness and safety of drugs. However, patient records typically come from different hospitals, thus raising the question of how multiple observational/experimental datasets can be effectively combined for this purpose. In our paper, we propose a new method that estimates the ATE from multiple observational/experimental datasets and provides valid CIs. Our method makes little assumptions about the observational datasets and is thus widely applicable in medical practice. The key idea of our method is that we leverage prediction-powered inferences and thereby essentially `shrink' the CIs so that we offer more precise uncertainty quantification as compared to na{\""i}ve approaches. We further prove the unbiasedness of our method and the validity of our CIs. We confirm our theoretical results through various numerical experiments."
Poster,Content-Style Learning from Unaligned Domains: Identifiability under Unknown Latent Dimensions,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28320,"Sagar Shrestha, Xiao Fu","Understanding identifiability of latent content and style variables from unaligned multi-domain data is essential for tasks such asdomain translation and data generation. Existing works on content-style identification were often developed under somewhat stringent conditions, e.g., that all latent components are mutually independent and that the dimensions of the content and style variables are known. We introduce a new analytical framework via cross-domain *latent distribution matching* (LDM), which establishes content-style identifiability under substantially more relaxed conditions. Specifically, we show that restrictive assumptions such as component-wise independence of the latent variables can be removed. Most notably, we prove that prior knowledge of the content and style dimensions is not necessary for ensuring identifiability, if sparsity constraints are properly imposed onto the learned latent representations. Bypassing the knowledge of the exact latent dimension has been a longstanding aspiration in unsupervised representation learning---our analysis is the first to underpin its theoretical and practical viability. On the implementation side, we recast the LDM formulation into a regularized multi-domain GAN loss with coupled latent variables. We show that the reformulation is equivalent to LDM under mild conditions---yet requiring considerably less computational resource. Experiments corroborate with our theoretical claims."
Poster,Context-Alignment: Activating and Enhancing LLMs Capabilities in Time Series,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28084,"Yuxiao Hu, Qian Li, Dongxiao Zhang, Jinyue Yan, Yuntian Chen","Recently, leveraging pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for time series (TS) tasks has gained increasing attention, which involves activating and enhancing LLMs' capabilities. Many methods aim to activate LLMs' capabilities based on token-level alignment, but overlook LLMs' inherent strength in natural language processing — their deep understanding of linguistic logic and structure rather than superficial embedding processing. We propose Context-Alignment (CA), a new paradigm that aligns TS with a linguistic component in the language environments familiar to LLMs to enable LLMs to contextualize and comprehend TS data, thereby activating their capabilities. Specifically, such context-level alignment comprises structural alignment and logical alignment, which is achieved by Dual-Scale Context-Alignment GNNs (DSCA-GNNs) applied to TS-language multimodal inputs. Structural alignment utilizes dual-scale nodes to describe hierarchical structure in TS-language, enabling LLMs to treat long TS data as a whole linguistic component while preserving intrinsic token features. Logical alignment uses directed edges to guide logical relationships, ensuring coherence in the contextual semantics. Following the DSCA-GNNs framework, we propose an instantiation method of CA, termed Few-Shot prompting Context-Alignment (FSCA), to enhance the capabilities of pre-trained LLMs in handling TS tasks. FSCA can be flexibly and repeatedly integrated into various layers of pre-trained LLMs to improve awareness of logic and structure, thereby enhancing performance. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of FSCA and the importance of Context-Alignment across tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot forecasting, confirming that Context-Alignment provides powerful prior knowledge on context. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/tokaka22/ICLR25-FSCA."
Poster,Context-aware Dynamic Pruning for Speech Foundation Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28001,"Masao Someki, Yifan Peng, Siddhant Arora, Markus Müller, Athanasios Mouchtaris, Grant Strimel, Jing Liu, Shinji Watanabe","Foundation models, such as large language models, have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and are evolving into models capable of handling multiple modalities.Listening ability, in particular, is crucial for many applications, leading to research on building speech foundation models. However, the high computational cost of these large models presents a significant challenge for real-world applications. Although substantial efforts have been made to reduce computational costs, such as through pruning techniques, the majority of these approaches are applied primarily during the training phase for specific downstream tasks. In this study, we hypothesize that optimal pruned networks may vary based on contextual factors such as speaker characteristics, languages, and tasks. To address this, we propose a dynamic pruning technique that adapts to these contexts during inference without altering the underlying model. We demonstrated that we could successfully reduce inference time by approximately 30\% while maintaining accuracy in multilingual/multi-task scenarios. We also found that the obtained pruned structure offers meaningful interpretations based on the context, e.g., task-related information emerging as the dominant factor for efficient pruning."
