Poster,Refine-by-Align: Reference-Guided Artifacts Refinement through Semantic Alignment,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30475,"Yizhi Song, Liu He, Zhifei Zhang, Soo Ye Kim, HE Zhang, Wei Xiong, Zhe Lin, Brian Price, Scott Cohen, Jianming Zhang, Daniel Aliaga","Personalized image generation has emerged from the recent advancements in generative models. However, these generated personalized images often suffer from localized artifacts such as incorrect logos, reducing fidelity and fine-grained identity details of the generated results. Furthermore, there is little prior work tackling this problem. To help improve these identity details in the personalized image generation, we introduce a new task: reference-guided artifacts refinement. We present Refine-by-Align, a first-of-its-kind model that employs a diffusion-based framework to address this challenge. Our model consists of two stages: Alignment Stage and Refinement Stage, which share weights of a unified neural network model. Given a generated image, a masked artifact region, and a reference image, the alignment stage identifies and extracts the corresponding regional features in the reference, which are then  used by the refinement stage to fix the artifacts. Our model-agnostic pipeline requires no test-time tuning or optimization. It automatically enhances image fidelity and reference identity in the generated image, generalizing well to existing models on various tasks including but not limited to customization, generative compositing, view synthesis, and virtual try-on. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate that our pipeline greatly pushes the boundary of fine details in the image synthesis models."
Poster,REFINE: Inversion-Free Backdoor Defense via Model Reprogramming,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31020,"Yukun Chen, Shuo Shao, Enhao Huang, Yiming Li, Pin-Yu Chen, Zhan Qin, Kui Ren","Backdoor attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a significant security threat, allowing adversaries to implant hidden malicious behaviors during the model training phase. Pre-processing-based defense, which is one of the most important defense paradigms, typically focuses on input transformations or backdoor trigger inversion (BTI) to deactivate or eliminate embedded backdoor triggers during the inference process. However, these methods suffer from inherent limitations: transformation-based defenses often fail to balance model utility and defense performance, while BTI-based defenses struggle to accurately reconstruct trigger patterns without prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose REFINE, an inversion-free backdoor defense method based on model reprogramming. REFINE consists of two key components: \textbf{(1)} an input transformation module that disrupts both benign and backdoor patterns, generating new benign features; and \textbf{(2)} an output remapping module that redefines the model's output domain to guide the input transformations effectively. By further integrating supervised contrastive loss, REFINE enhances the defense capabilities while maintaining model utility. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our REFINE and its resistance to potential adaptive attacks."
Poster,Refine Knowledge of Large Language Models via Adaptive Contrastive Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30207,"Yinghui Li, Haojing Huang, Jiayi Kuang, Yangning Li, Shu-Yu Guo, Chao Qu, Xiaoyu Tan, Hai-Tao Zheng, Ying Shen, Philip Yu","How to alleviate the hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) has always been the fundamental goal pursued by the LLMs research community. Looking through numerous hallucination-related studies, a mainstream category of methods is to reduce hallucinations by optimizing the knowledge representation of LLMs to change their output. Considering that the core focus of these works is the knowledge acquired by models, and knowledge has long been a central theme in human societal progress, we believe that the process of models refining knowledge can greatly benefit from the way humans learn. In our work, by imitating the human learning process, we design an Adaptive Contrastive Learning strategy. Our method flexibly constructs different positive and negative samples for contrastive learning based on LLMs' actual mastery of knowledge. This strategy helps LLMs consolidate the correct knowledge they already possess, deepen their understanding of the correct knowledge they have encountered but not fully grasped, forget the incorrect knowledge they previously learned, and honestly acknowledge the knowledge they lack. Extensive experiments and detailed analyses on widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and competitiveness of our method."
Poster,Refining CLIP's Spatial Awareness: A Visual-Centric Perspective,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31093,"Congpei Qiu, Yanhao Wu, Wei Ke, Xiuxiu Bai, Tong Zhang","Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in global alignment with language but exhibits limited sensitivity to spatial information, leading to strong performance in zero-shot classification tasks but underperformance in tasks requiring precise spatial understanding. Recent approaches have introduced Region-Language Alignment (RLA) to enhance CLIP's performance in dense multimodal tasks by aligning regional visual representations with corresponding text inputs. However, we find that CLIP ViTs fine-tuned with RLA suffer from notable loss in spatial awareness, which is crucial for dense prediction tasks. To address this, we propose the Spatial Correlation Distillation (SCD) framework, which preserves CLIP's inherent spatial structure and mitigates above degradation. To further enhance spatial correlations, we introduce a lightweight Refiner that extracts refined correlations directly from CLIP before feeding them into SCD, based on an intriguring finding that CLIP naturally capture high-quality dense features. Together, these components form a robust distillation framework that enables CLIP ViTs to integrate both visual-language and visual-centric improvements, achieving state-of-the-art results across various open-vocabulary dense prediction benchmarks."
Poster,Reflective Gaussian Splatting,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27783,"Yuxuan Yao, Zixuan Zeng, Chun Gu, Xiatian Zhu, Li Zhang","Novel view synthesis has experienced significant advancements owing to increasingly capable NeRF- and 3DGS-based methods. However, reflective object reconstruction remains challenging, lacking a proper solution to achieve real-time, high-quality rendering while accommodating inter-reflection. To fill this gap, we introduce a Reflective Gaussian splatting (Ref-Gaussian) framework characterized with two components: (I) Physically based deferred rendering that empowers the rendering equation with pixel-level material properties via formulating split-sum approximation; (II) Gaussian-grounded inter-reflection that realizes the desired inter-reflection function within a Gaussian splatting paradigm for the first time. To enhance geometry modeling, we further introduce material-aware normal propagation and an initial per-Gaussian shading stage, along with 2D Gaussian primitives. Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that Ref-Gaussian surpasses existing approaches in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, and compute efficiency. Further, we show that our method serves as a unified solution for both reflective and non-reflective scenes, going beyond the previous alternatives focusing on only reflective scenes. Also, we illustrate that Ref-Gaussian supports more applications such as relighting and editing."
Poster,Reflexive Guidance: Improving OoDD in Vision-Language Models via Self-Guided Image-Adaptive Concept Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29663,"Jihyo Kim, Seulbi Lee, Sangheum Hwang","With the recent emergence of foundation models trained on internet-scale data and demonstrating remarkable generalization capabilities, such foundation models have become more widely adopted, leading to an expanding range of application domains. Despite this rapid proliferation, the trustworthiness of foundation models remains underexplored. Specifically, the out-of-distribution detection (OoDD) capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, which are trained on massive multi-modal data, have not been sufficiently addressed. The disparity between their demonstrated potential and practical reliability raises concerns regarding the safe and trustworthy deployment of foundation models. To address this gap, we evaluate and analyze the OoDD capabilities of various proprietary and open-source LVLMs. Our investigation contributes to a better understanding of how these foundation models represent confidence scores through their generated natural language responses. Furthermore, we propose a self-guided prompting approach, termed Reflexive Guidance (ReGuide), aimed at enhancing the OoDD capability of LVLMs by leveraging self-generated image-adaptive concept suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that our ReGuide enhances the performance of current LVLMs in both image classification and OoDD tasks. The lists of sampled images, along with the prompts and responses for each sample are available at https://github.com/daintlab/ReGuide."
Poster,Reframing Structure-Based Drug Design Model Evaluation via Metrics Correlated to Practical Needs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29635,"Bowen Gao, Haichuan Tan, Yanwen Huang, Minsi Ren, Xiao Huang, Wei-Ying Ma, Ya-Qin Zhang, Yanyan Lan","Recent advances in structure-based drug design (SBDD) have produced surprising results, with models often generating molecules that achieve better Vina docking scores than actual ligands. However, these results are frequently overly optimistic due to the limitations of docking score accuracy and the challenges of wet-lab validation. While generated molecules may demonstrate high QED (drug-likeness) and SA (synthetic accessibility) scores, they often lack true drug-like properties or synthesizability. To address these limitations, we propose a model-level evaluation framework that emphasizes practical metrics aligned with real-world applications. Inspired by recent findings on the utility of generated molecules in ligand-based virtual screening, our framework evaluates SBDD models by their ability to produce molecules that effectively retrieve active compounds from chemical libraries via similarity-based searches. This approach provides a direct indication of therapeutic potential, bridging the gap between theoretical performance and real-world utility. Our experiments reveal that while SBDD models may excel in theoretical metrics like Vina scores, they often fall short in these practical metrics. By introducing this new evaluation strategy, we aim to enhance the relevance and impact of SBDD models for pharmaceutical research and development."
Poster,ReGenesis: LLMs can Grow into Reasoning Generalists via Self-Improvement,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29261,"XIANGYU PENG, Congying Xia, Xinyi Yang, Caiming Xiong, Chien-Sheng Wu, Chen Xing","Post-training Large Language Models (LLMs) with explicit reasoning trajectories can enhance their reasoning abilities. However, acquiring such high-quality trajectory data typically demands meticulous supervision from humans or superior models, which can be either expensive or license-constrained. In this paper, we explore how far an LLM can improve its reasoning by self-synthesizing reasoning paths as training data without any additional supervision. Existing self-synthesizing methods, such as STaR, suffer from poor generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) reasoning tasks. We hypothesize it is due to that their self-synthesized reasoning paths are too task-specific, lacking general task-agnostic reasoning guidance. To address this, we propose **Reasoning Generalist via Self-Improvement (ReGenesis)**, a method to *self-synthesize reasoning paths as post-training data by progressing from abstract to concrete*. More specifically, ReGenesis self-synthesizes reasoning paths by converting general reasoning guidelines into task-specific ones, generating reasoning structures, and subsequently transforming these structures into reasoning paths, without the need for human-designed task-specific examples used in existing methods. We show that ReGenesis achieves superior performance on all in-domain and OOD settings tested compared to existing methods. For six OOD tasks specifically, while previous methods exhibited an average performance decrease of approximately 4.6% after post training, ReGenesis delivers around 6.1% performance improvement. We also conduct an in-depth analysis of our framework and show ReGenesis is effective across various language models and design choices."
Poster,ReGen: Generative Robot Simulation via Inverse Design,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30399,"Peter (Phat) Nguyen, Johnson (Tsun-Hsuan) Wang, Zhang-Wei Hong, Erfan Aasi, Andrew Silva, Guy Rosman, Sertac Karaman, Daniela Rus","Simulation plays a key role in scaling robot learning and validating policies, but constructing simulations remains labor-intensive. In this paper, we introduce ReGen, a generative simulation framework that automates this process using inverse design. Given an agent's behavior (such as a motion trajectory or objective function) and its textual description, we infer the underlying scenarios and environments that could have caused the behavior.Our approach leverages large language models to construct and expand a graph that captures cause-and-effect relationships and relevant entities with properties in the environment, which is then processed to configure a robot simulation environment. Our approach supports (i) augmenting simulations based on ego-agent behaviors, (ii) controllable, counterfactual scenario generation, (iii) reasoning about agent cognition and mental states, and (iv) reasoning with distinct sensing modalities, such as braking due to faulty GPS signals. We demonstrate our method in autonomous driving and robot manipulation tasks, generating more diverse, complex simulated environments compared to existing simulations with high success rates, and enabling controllable generation for corner cases. This approach enhances the validation of robot policies and supports data or simulation augmentation, advancing scalable robot learning for improved generalization and robustness."
Poster,REGENT: A Retrieval-Augmented Generalist Agent That Can Act In-Context in New Environments,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29847,"Kaustubh Sridhar, Souradeep Dutta, Dinesh Jayaraman, Insup Lee","Building generalist agents that can rapidly adapt to new environments is a key challenge for deploying AI in the digital and real worlds. Is scaling current agent architectures the most effective way to build generalist agents? We propose a novel approach to pre-train relatively small policies on relatively small datasets and adapt them to unseen environments via in-context learning, without any finetuning. Our key idea is that retrieval offers a powerful bias for fast adaptation. Indeed, we demonstrate that even a simple retrieval-based 1-nearest neighbor agent offers a surprisingly strong baseline for today's state-of-the-art generalist agents. From this starting point, we construct a semi-parametric agent, REGENT, that trains a transformer-based policy on sequences of queries and retrieved neighbors. REGENT can generalize to unseen robotics and game-playing environments via retrieval augmentation and in-context learning, achieving this with up to 3x fewer parameters and up to an order-of-magnitude fewer pre-training datapoints, significantly outperforming today's state-of-the-art generalist agents."
