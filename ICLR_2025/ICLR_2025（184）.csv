Poster,Learning 3D Perception from Others' Predictions,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29248,"Jinsu Yoo, Zhenyang Feng, Tai-Yu Pan, Yihong Sun, Cheng Perng Phoo, Xiangyu Chen, Mark Campbell, Kilian Weinberger, Bharath Hariharan, Wei-Lun Chao","Accurate 3D object detection in real-world environments requires a huge amount of annotated data with high quality. Acquiring such data is tedious and expensive, and often needs repeated effort when a new sensor is adopted or when the detector is deployed in a new environment. We investigate a new scenario to construct 3D object detectors: *learning from the predictions of a nearby unit that is equipped with an accurate detector.* For example, when a self-driving car enters a new area, it may learn from other traffic participants whose detectors have been optimized for that area. This setting is label-efficient, sensor-agnostic, and communication-efficient: nearby units only need to share the predictions with the ego agent (e.g., car). Naively using the received predictions as ground-truths to train the detector for the ego car, however, leads to inferior performance. We systematically study the problem and identify viewpoint mismatches and mislocalization (due to synchronization and GPS errors) as the main causes, which unavoidably result in false positives, false negatives, and inaccurate pseudo labels. We propose a distance-based curriculum, first learning from closer units with similar viewpoints and subsequently improving the quality of other units' predictions via self-training. We further demonstrate that an effective pseudo label refinement module can be trained with a handful of annotated data, largely reducing the data quantity necessary to train an object detector. We validate our approach on the recently released real-world collaborative driving dataset, using reference cars' predictions as pseudo labels for the ego car. Extensive experiments including several scenarios (e.g., different sensors, detectors, and domains) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach toward label-efficient learning of 3D perception from other units' predictions."
Poster,Learning a Fast Mixing Exogenous Block MDP using a Single Trajectory,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31043,"Alexander Levine, Peter Stone, Amy Zhang","In order to train agents that can quickly adapt to new objectives or reward functions, efficient unsupervised representation learning in sequential decision-making environments can be important. Frameworks such as the Exogenous Block Markov Decision Process (Ex-BMDP) have been proposed to formalize this representation-learning problem (Efroni et al., 2022b). In the Ex-BMDP framework, the agent's high-dimensional observations of the environment have two latent factors: a controllable factor, which evolves deterministically within a small state space according to the agent's actions, and an exogenous factor, which represents time-correlated noise, and can be highly complex. The goal of the representation learning problem is to learn an encoder that maps from observations into the controllable latent space, as well as the dynamics of this space. Efroni et al. (2022b) has shown that this is possible with a sample complexity that depends only on the size of the controllable latent space, and not on the size of the noise factor. However, this prior work has focused on the episodic setting, where the controllable latent state resets to a specific start state after a finite horizon.By contrast, if the agent can only interact with the environment in a single continuous trajectory, prior works have not established sample-complexity bounds. We propose STEEL, the first provably sample-efficient algorithm for learning the controllable dynamics of an Ex-BMDP from a single trajectory, in the function approximation setting. STEEL has a sample complexity that depends only on the sizes of the controllable latent space and the encoder function class, and (at worst linearly) on the mixing time of the exogenous noise factor. We prove that STEEL is correct and sample-efficient, and demonstrate STEEL on two toy problems. Code is available at: https://github.com/midi-lab/steel."
Poster,Learning and aligning single-neuron invariance manifolds in visual cortex,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28569,"Mohammad Bashiri, Luca Baroni, Ján Antolík, Fabian Sinz","Understanding how sensory neurons exhibit selectivity to certain features and invariance to others is central to uncovering the computational principles underlying robustness and generalization in visual perception. Most existing methods for characterizing selectivity and invariance identify single or finite discrete sets of stimuli. Since these are only isolated measurements from an underlying continuous manifold, characterizing invariance properties accurately and comparing them across neurons with varying receptive field size, position, and orientation, becomes challenging. Consequently, a systematic analysis of invariance types at the population level remains under-explored. Building on recent advances in learning continuous invariance manifolds, we introduce a novel method to accurately identify and align invariance manifolds of visual sensory neurons, overcoming these challenges. Our approach first learns the continuous invariance manifold of stimuli that maximally excite a neuron modeled by a response-predicting deep neural network. It then learns an affine transformation on the pixel coordinates such that the same manifold activates another neuron as strongly as possible, effectively aligning their invariance manifolds spatially. This alignment provides a principled way to quantify and compare neuronal invariances irrespective of receptive field differences. Using simulated neurons, we demonstrate that our method accurately learns and aligns known invariance manifolds, robustly identifying functional clusters. When applied to macaque V1 neurons, it reveals functional clusters of neurons, including simple and complex cells. Overall, our method enables systematic, quantitative exploration of the neural invariance landscape, to gain new insights into the functional properties of visual sensory neurons."
Poster,Learning a Neural Solver for Parametric PDEs to Enhance Physics-Informed Methods,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28615,"Lise Le Boudec, Emmanuel de Bézenac, Louis Serrano, Ramon Daniel Regueiro-Espino, Yuan Yin, patrick Gallinari","Physics-informed deep learning often faces optimization challenges due to the complexity of solving partial differential equations (PDEs), which involve exploring large solution spaces, require numerous iterations, and can lead to unstable training. These challenges arise particularly from the ill-conditioning of the optimization problem, caused by the differential terms in the loss function. To address these issues, we propose learning a solver, i.e., solving PDEs using a physics-informed iterative algorithm trained on data. Our method learns to condition a gradient descent algorithm that automatically adapts to each PDE instance, significantly accelerating and stabilizing the optimization process and enabling faster convergence of physics-aware models. Furthermore, while traditional physics-informed methods solve for a single PDE instance, our approach addresses parametric PDEs. Specifically, our method integrates the physical loss gradient with the PDE parameters to solve over a distribution of PDE parameters, including coefficients, initial conditions, or boundary conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through empirical experiments on multiple datasets, comparing training and test-time optimization performance."
Poster,Learning-Augmented Frequent Directions,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29356,"Anders Aamand, Justin Chen, Siddharth Gollapudi, Sandeep Silwal, Hao WU","An influential paper of Hsu et al. (ICLR'19) introduced the study of learning-augmented streaming algorithms in the context of frequency estimation. A fundamental problem in the streaming literature, the goal of frequency estimation is to approximate the number of occurrences of items appearing in a long stream of data using only a small amount of memory. Hsu et al. develop a natural framework to combine the worst-case guarantees of popular solutions such as CountMin and CountSketch with learned predictions of high frequency elements. They demonstrate that learning the underlying structure of data can be used to yield better streaming algorithms, both in theory and practice.We simplify and generalize past work on learning-augmented frequency estimation. Our first contribution is a learning-augmented variant of the Misra-Gries algorithm which improves upon the error of learned CountMin and learned CountSketch and achieves the state-of-the-art performance of randomized algorithms (Aamand et al., NeurIPS'23) with a simpler, deterministic algorithm. Our second contribution is to adapt learning-augmentation to a high-dimensional generalization of frequency estimation corresponding to finding important directions (top singular vectors) of a matrix given its rows one-by-one in a stream. We analyze a learning-augmented variant of the Frequent Directions algorithm, extending the theoretical and empirical understanding of learned predictions to matrix streaming."
Poster,Learning-Augmented Search Data Structures,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29901,"Chunkai Fu, Brandon G. Nguyen, Jung Seo, Ryan Zesch, Samson Zhou","We study the integration of machine learning advice to improve upon traditional data structure designed for efficient search queries. Although there has been recent effort in improving the performance of binary search trees using machine learning advice, e.g., Lin et. al.  (ICML 2022), the resulting constructions nevertheless suffer from inherent weaknesses of binary search trees, such as complexity of maintaining balance across multiple updates and the inability to handle partially-ordered or high-dimensional datasets. For these reasons, we focus on skip lists and KD trees in this work. Given access to a possibly erroneous oracle that outputs estimated fractional frequencies for search queries on a set of items, we construct skip lists and KD trees that provably provides the optimal expected search time, within nearly a factor of two. In fact, our learning-augmented skip lists and KD trees are still optimal up to a constant factor, even if the oracle is only accurate within a constant factor. We also demonstrate robustness by showing that our data structures achieves an expected search time that is within a constant factor of an oblivious skip list/KD tree construction even when the predictions are arbitrarily incorrect. Finally, we empirically show that our learning-augmented search data structures outperforms their corresponding traditional analogs on both synthetic and real-world datasets."
Poster,Learning Causal Alignment for Reliable Disease Diagnosis,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28327,"Mingzhou Liu, Ching-Wen Lee, Xinwei Sun, Xueqing Yu, YU QIAO, Yizhou Wang","Aligning the decision-making process of machine learning algorithms with that of experienced radiologists is crucial for reliable diagnosis. While existing methods have attempted to align their prediction behaviors to those of radiologists reflected in the training data, this alignment is primarily associational rather than causal, resulting in pseudo-correlations that may not transfer well. In this paper, we propose a causality-based alignment framework towards aligning the model's decision process with that of experts. Specifically, we first employ counterfactual generation to identify the causal chain of model decisions. To align this causal chain with that of experts, we propose a causal alignment loss that enforces the model to focus on causal factors underlying each decision step in the whole causal chain. To optimize this loss that involves the counterfactual generator as an implicit function of the model's parameters, we employ the implicit function theorem equipped with the conjugate gradient method for efficient estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two medical diagnosis applications, showcasing faithful alignment to radiologists."
Poster,Learning Chaos In A Linear Way,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29977,"Xiaoyuan Cheng, Yi He, Yiming Yang, Xiao Xue, Sibo Cheng, Daniel Giles, Xiaohang Tang, Yukun Hu","Learning long-term behaviors in chaotic dynamical systems, such as turbulent flows and climate modelling, is challenging due to their inherent instability and unpredictability. These systems exhibit positive Lyapunov exponents, which significantly hinder accurate long-term forecasting. As a result, understanding long-term statistical behavior is far more valuable than focusing on short-term accuracy. While autoregressive deep sequence models have been applied to capture long-term behavior, they often lead to exponentially increasing errors in learned dynamics. To address this, we shift the focus from simple prediction errors to preserving an invariant measure in dissipative chaotic systems. These systems have attractors, where trajectories settle, and the invariant measure is the probability distribution on attractors that remains unchanged under dynamics. Existing methods generate long trajectories of dissipative chaotic systems by aligning invariant measures, but it is not always possible to obtain invariant measures for arbitrary datasets. We propose the Poincaré Flow Neural Network (PFNN), a novel operator learning framework designed to capture behaviors of chaotic systems without any explicit knowledge of the invariant measure. PFNN employs an auto-encoder to map the chaotic system to a finite-dimensional feature space, effectively linearizing the chaotic evolution.  It then learns the linear evolution operators to match the physical dynamics by addressing two critical properties in dissipative chaotic systems: (1) contraction, the system’s convergence toward its attractors, and (2) measure invariance, trajectories on the attractors following a probability distribution invariant to the dynamics. Our experiments on a variety of chaotic systems, including Lorenz systems, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and Navier–Stokes equation, demonstrate that PFNN has more accurate predictions and physical statistics compared to competitive baselines including the Fourier Neural Operator and the Markov Neural Operator."
Poster,Learning Clustering-based Prototypes for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28941,"Hongyu Qu, Jianan Wei, Xiangbo Shu, Wenguan Wang","Learning primitive (i.e., attribute and object) concepts from seen compositions is the primary challenge of Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL). Existing CZSL solutions typically rely on oversimplified data assumptions, e.g., modeling each primitive with a single centroid primitive presentation, ignoring the natural diversities of the attribute (resp. object) when coupled with different objects (resp. attribute). In this work, we develop ClusPro, a robust clustering-based prototype mining framework for CZSL that defines the conceptual boundaries of primitives through a set of diversified prototypes. Specifically, ClusPro conducts within-primitive clustering on the embedding space for automatically discovering and dynamically updating prototypes. To learn high-quality embeddings for discriminative prototype construction, ClusPro repaints a well-structured and independent primitive embedding space, ensuring intra-primitive separation and inter-primitive decorrelation through prototype-based contrastive learning and decorrelation learning. Moreover, ClusPro effectively performs prototype clustering in a non-parametric fashion without the introduction of additional learnable parameters or computational budget during testing. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate ClusPro outperforms various top-leading CZSL solutions under both closed-world and open-world settings. Our code is available at CLUSPRO."
Poster,Learning Color Equivariant Representations,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30166,"Yulong Yang, Felix O&#x27;Mahony, Christine Allen-Blanchette","In this paper, we introduce group convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) equivariant to color variation. GCNNs have been designed for a variety of geometric transformations from 2D and 3D rotation groups, to semi-groups such as scale. Despite the improved interpretability, accuracy and generalizability of these architectures, GCNNs have seen limited application in the context of perceptual quantities. Notably, the recent CEConv network uses a GCNN to achieve equivariance to hue transformations by convolving input images with a hue rotated RGB filter. However, this approach leads to invalid RGB values which break equivariance and degrade performance. We resolve these issues with a lifting layer that transforms the input image directly, thereby circumventing the issue of invalid RGB values and improving equivariance error by over three orders of magnitude. Moreover, we extend the notion of color equivariance to include equivariance to saturation and luminance shift. Our hue-, saturation-, luminance- and color-equivariant networks achieve strong generalization to out-of-distribution perceptual variations and improved sample efficiency over conventional architectures. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on synthetic and real world datasets where we consistently outperform competitive baselines."
