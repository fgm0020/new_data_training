Poster,OS-ATLAS: Foundation Action Model for Generalist GUI Agents,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28423,"Zhiyong Wu, Zhenyu Wu, Fangzhi Xu, Yian Wang, Qiushi Sun, Chengyou Jia, Kanzhi Cheng, Zichen Ding, Liheng Chen, Paul Pu Liang, Yu Qiao","Existing efforts in building GUI agents heavily rely on the availability of robust commercial Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o and GeminiProVision. Practitioners are often reluctant to use open-source VLMs due to their significant performance lag compared to their closed-source counterparts, particularly in GUI grounding and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate future research in this area, we developed OS-Atlas—a foundational GUI action model that excels at GUI grounding and OOD agentic tasks through innovations in both data and modeling.We have invested significant engineering effort in developing an open-source toolkit for synthesizing GUI grounding data across multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and the web. Leveraging this toolkit, we are releasing the largest open-source cross-platform GUI grounding corpus to date, which contains over 13 million GUI elements. This dataset, combined with innovations in model training, provides a solid foundation for OS-Atlas to understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces.Through extensive evaluation across six benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web), OS-Atlas demonstrates significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art models. Our evaluation also uncovers valuable insights into continuously improving and scaling the agentic capabilities of open-source VLMs."
Poster,OSCAR: Operating System Control via State-Aware Reasoning and Re-Planning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29394,"Xiaoqiang Wang, Bang Liu","Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential in automating complex tasks like web browsing and gaming. However, their ability to generalize across diverse applications remains limited, hindering broader utility. To address this challenge, we present OSCAR: Operating System Control via state-Aware reasoning and Re-planning. OSCAR is a generalist agent designed to autonomously navigate and interact with various desktop and mobile applications through standardized controls, such as mouse and keyboard inputs, while processing screen images to fulfill user commands. OSCAR translates human instructions into executable Python code, enabling precise control over graphical user interfaces (GUIs). To enhance stability and adaptability, OSCAR operates as a state machine, equipped with error-handling mechanisms and dynamic task re-planning, allowing it to efficiently adjust to real-time feedback and exceptions. We demonstrate OSCAR’s effectiveness through extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks across desktop and mobile platforms, where it transforms complex workflows into simple natural language commands, significantly boosting user productivity. Our code will be open-source upon publication."
Poster,Oscillatory State-Space Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30278,"T. Konstantin Rusch, Daniela Rus","We propose Linear Oscillatory State-Space models (LinOSS) for efficiently learning on long sequences. Inspired by cortical dynamics of biological neural networks, we base our proposed LinOSS model on a system of forced harmonic oscillators. A stable discretization, integrated over time using fast associative parallel scans, yields the proposed state-space model. We prove that LinOSS produces stable dynamics only requiring nonnegative diagonal state matrix. This is in stark contrast to many previous state-space models relying heavily on restrictive parameterizations. Moreover, we rigorously show that LinOSS is universal, i.e., it can approximate any continuous and causal operator mapping between time-varying functions, to desired accuracy. In addition, we show that an implicit-explicit discretization of LinOSS perfectly conserves the symmetry of time reversibility of the underlying dynamics. Together, these properties enable efficient modeling of long-range interactions, while ensuring stable and accurate long-horizon forecasting. Finally, our empirical results, spanning a wide range of time-series tasks from mid-range to very long-range classification and regression, as well as long-horizon forecasting, demonstrate that our proposed LinOSS model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models. Notably, LinOSS outperforms Mamba and LRU by nearly 2x on a sequence modeling task with sequences of length 50k."
Poster,OSDA Agent: Leveraging Large Language Models for De Novo Design of Organic Structure Directing Agents,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30683,"Zhaolin Hu, Yixiao Zhou, Zhongan Wang, Xin Li, Weimin Yang, Hehe Fan, Yi Yang","Zeolites are crystalline porous materials that have been widely utilized in petrochemical industries as well as sustainable chemistry areas. Synthesis of zeolites often requires small molecules termed Organic Structure Directing Agents (OSDAs), which are critical in forming the porous structure. Molecule generation models can aid the design of OSDAs, but they are limited by single functionality and lack of interactivity. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, as general-purpose artificial intelligence systems, excel in instruction comprehension, logical reasoning, and interactive communication. However, LLMs lack in-depth chemistry knowledge and first-principle computation capabilities, resulting in uncontrollable outcomes even after fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose OSDA Agent, an interactive OSDA design framework that leverages LLMs as the brain, coupled with computational chemistry tools. The OSDA Agent consists of three main components: the Actor, responsible for generating potential OSDA structures; the Evaluator, which assesses and scores the generated OSDAs using computational chemistry tools; and the Self-reflector, which produces reflective summaries based on the Evaluator's feedback to refine the Actor's subsequent outputs. Experiments on representative zeolite frameworks show the generation-evaluation-reflection-refinement workflow can perform de novo design of OSDAs with superior generation quality than the pure LLM model, generating candidates consistent with experimentally validated OSDAs and optimizing known OSDAs."
Poster,OSTQuant: Refining Large Language Model Quantization with Orthogonal and Scaling Transformations for Better Distribution Fitting,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28216,"Xing Hu, Yuan Cheng, Dawei Yang, Zhixuan Chen, Dawei Yang, Jiangyong Yu, XUCHEN, Zhihang Yuan, Zhe jiang, Sifan Zhou","Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted technique for compressing and accelerating Large Language Models (LLMs).The major challenge in LLM quantization is that uneven and heavy-tailed data distributions can expand the quantization range, thereby reducing bit precision for most values.Recent methods attempt to eliminate outliers and balance inter-channel differences by employing linear transformations; however, they remain  heuristic and are often overlook optimizing the data distribution across the entire quantization space.In this paper, we introduce Quantization Space Utilization Rate (QSUR), a novel metric that effectively assesses the quantizability of transformed data by measuring the space utilization of the data in the quantization space. We complement QSUR with mathematical derivations that examine the effects and limitations of various transformations, guiding our development of Orthogonal and Scaling Transformation-based Quantization (OSTQuant). OSTQuant employs a learnable equivalent transformation, consisting of an orthogonal transformation and a scaling transformation, to optimize the distributions of weights and activations across the entire quantization space. Futhermore, we propose the KL-Top loss function, designed to mitigate noise during optimization while retaining richer semantic information within the limited calibration data imposed by PTQ.OSTQuant outperforms existing work on various LLMs and benchmarks. In the W4-only setting, it retains 99.5\% of the floating-point accuracy. In the more challenging W4A4KV4 configuration, OSTQuant reduces the performance gap by 32\% on the LLaMA-3-8B model compared to state-of-the-art methods. Code will be available."
Poster,Outlier Synthesis via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for Out-of-Distribution Detection,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29899,"Hengzhuang Li, Teng Zhang","Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for developing trustworthy and reliable machine learning systems. Recent advances in training with auxiliary OOD data demonstrate efficacy in enhancing detection capabilities. Nonetheless, these methods heavily rely on acquiring a large pool of high-quality natural outliers. Some prior methods try to alleviate this problem by synthesizing virtual outliers but suffer from either poor quality or high cost due to the monotonous sampling strategy and the heavy-parameterized generative models. In this paper, we overcome all these problems by proposing the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Outlier Synthesis (HamOS) framework, which views the synthesis process as sampling from Markov chains. Based solely on the in-distribution data, the Markov chains can extensively traverse the feature space and generate diverse and representative outliers, hence exposing the model to miscellaneous potential OOD scenarios. The Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with sampling acceptance rate almost close to 1 also makes our framework enjoy great efficiency. By empirically competing with SOTA baselines on both standard and large-scale benchmarks, we verify the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed HamOS."
Poster,Out-of-distribution Generalization for Total Variation based Invariant Risk Minimization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29073,"Yuanchao Wang, Zhao-Rong Lai, Tianqi Zhong","Invariant risk minimization is an important general machine learning framework that has recently been interpreted as a total variation model (IRM-TV). However, how to improve out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in the IRM-TV setting remains unsolved. In this paper, we extend IRM-TV to a Lagrangian multiplier model named OOD-TV-IRM. We find that the autonomous TV penalty hyperparameter is exactly the Lagrangian multiplier. Thus OOD-TV-IRM is essentially a primal-dual optimization model, where the primal optimization minimizes the entire invariant risk and the dual optimization strengthens the TV penalty. The objective is to reach a semi-Nash equilibrium where the balance between the training loss and OOD generalization is maintained. We also develop a convergent primal-dual algorithm that facilitates an adversarial learning scheme. Experimental results show that OOD-TV-IRM outperforms IRM-TV in most situations."
Poster,Overcoming False Illusions in Real-World Face Restoration with Multi-Modal Guided Diffusion Model,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28479,"Keda TAO, Jinjin Gu, Yulun Zhang, Xiucheng Wang, Nan Cheng","We introduce a novel Multi-modal Guided Real-World Face Restoration (MGFR) technique designed to improve the quality of facial image restoration from low-quality inputs. Leveraging a blend of attribute text prompts, high-quality reference images, and identity information, MGFR can mitigate the generation of false facial attributes and identities often associated with generative face restoration methods. By incorporating a dual-control adapter and a two-stage training strategy, our method effectively utilizes multi-modal prior information for targeted restoration tasks. We also present the Reface-HQ dataset, comprising over 21,000 high-resolution facial images across 4800 identities, to address the need for reference face training images. Our approach achieves superior visual quality in restoring facial details under severe degradation and allows for controlled restoration processes, enhancing the accuracy of identity preservation and attribute correction. Including negative quality samples and attribute prompts in the training further refines the model's ability to generate detailed and perceptually accurate images."
Poster,Overcoming Lower-Level Constraints in Bilevel Optimization: A Novel Approach with Regularized Gap Functions,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29020,"Wei Yao, Haian Yin, Shangzhi Zeng, Jin Zhang","Constrained bilevel optimization tackles nested structures present in constrained learning tasks like constrained meta-learning, adversarial learning, and distributed bilevel optimization. However, existing bilevel optimization methods mostly are typically restricted to specific constraint settings, such as linear lower-level constraints. In this work, we overcome this limitation and develop a new single-loop, Hessian-free constrained bilevel algorithm capable of handling more general lower-level constraints. We achieve this by employing a doubly regularized gap function tailored to the constrained lower-level problem, transforming constrained bilevel optimization into an equivalent single-level optimization problem with a single smooth constraint. We rigorously establish the non-asymptotic convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm under the convexity of lower-level problem, avoiding the need for strong convexity assumptions on the lower-level objective or coupling convexity assumptions on lower-level constraints found in existing literature. Additionally, the generality of our method allows for its extension to bilevel optimization with minimax lower-level problem. We evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm on various synthetic problems, typical hyperparameter learning tasks, and generative adversarial network."
Poster,Overcoming Slow Decision Frequencies in Continuous Control: Model-Based Sequence Reinforcement Learning for Model-Free Control,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27877,"Devdhar Patel, Hava Siegelmann","Reinforcement learning (RL) is rapidly reaching and surpassing human-level control capabilities. However, state-of-the-art RL algorithms often require timesteps and reaction times significantly faster than human capabilities, which is impractical in real-world settings and typically necessitates specialized hardware. We introduce Sequence Reinforcement Learning (SRL), an RL algorithm designed to produce a sequence of actions for a given input state, enabling effective control at lower decision frequencies. SRL addresses the challenges of learning action sequences by employing both a model and an actor-critic architecture operating at different temporal scales. We propose a ""temporal recall"" mechanism, where the critic uses the model to estimate intermediate states between primitive actions, providing a learning signal for each individual action within the sequence. Once training is complete, the actor can generate action sequences independently of the model, achieving model-free control at a slower frequency. We evaluate SRL on a suite of continuous control tasks, demonstrating that it achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms while significantly reducing actor sample complexity. To better assess performance across varying decision frequencies, we introduce the Frequency-Averaged Score (FAS) metric. Our results show that SRL significantly outperforms traditional RL algorithms in terms of FAS, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring variable decision frequencies. Furthermore, we compare SRL with model-based online planning, showing that SRL achieves comparable FAS while leveraging the same model during training that online planners use for planning."
