Poster,HELM: Hierarchical Encoding for mRNA Language Modeling,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29936,"Mehdi Yazdani-Jahromi, Mangal Prakash, Tommaso Mansi, Artem Moskalev, Rui Liao","Messenger RNA (mRNA) plays a crucial role in protein synthesis, with its codon structure directly impacting biological properties. While Language Models (LMs) have shown promise in analyzing biological sequences, existing approaches fail to account for the hierarchical nature of mRNA's codon structure. We introduce Hierarchical Encoding for mRNA Language Modeling (HELM), a novel pre-training strategy that incorporates codon-level hierarchical structure into language model training. HELM modulates the loss function based on codon synonymity, aligning the model's learning process with the biological reality of mRNA sequences. We evaluate HELM on diverse mRNA datasets and tasks, demonstrating that HELM outperforms standard language model pre-training as well as existing foundation model baselines on six diverse downstream property prediction tasks and an antibody region annotation tasks on average by around 8%. Additionally, HELM enhances the generative capabilities of language model, producing diverse mRNA sequences that better align with the underlying true data distribution compared to  non-hierarchical baselines."
Poster,HelpSteer2-Preference: Complementing Ratings with Preferences,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29917,"Zhilin Wang, Alexander Bukharin, Olivier Delalleau, Daniel Egert, Gerald Shen, Jiaqi Zeng, Oleksii Kuchaiev, Yi Dong","Reward models are critical for aligning models to follow instructions, and are typically trained following one of two popular paradigms: Bradley-Terry style or Regression style. However, there is a lack of evidence that either approach is better than the other, when adequately matched for data. This is primarily because these approaches require data collected in different (but incompatible) formats, meaning that adequately matched data is not available in existing public datasets. To tackle this problem, we release preference annotations (designed for Bradley-Terry training) to complement existing ratings (designed for Regression style training) in the HelpSteer2 dataset. To improve data interpretability, preference annotations are accompanied with human-written justifications. Using this data, we conduct the first head-to-head comparison of Bradley-Terry and Regression models when adequately matched for data. Based on insights derived from such a comparison, we propose a novel approach to combine Bradley-Terry and Regression reward modeling. A Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct model tuned with this approach scores 94.1 on RewardBench, emerging top of more than 140 reward models as of 1 Oct 2024. This reward model can then be used with REINFORCE algorithm (RLHF) to align an Instruct model to reach 85.0 on Arena Hard, which is No. 1 as of 1 Oct 2024.We open-source this dataset (CC-BY-4.0 license) at https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer2#preferences-new---1-oct-2024 and openly release the trained Reward and Instruct models at https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Reward and https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct ."
Poster,Herald: A Natural Language Annotated Lean 4 Dataset,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29589,"Guoxiong Gao, Yutong Wang, Jiedong Jiang, Qi Gao, Zihan Qin, Tianyi Xu, Bin Dong","Verifiable formal languages like Lean have profoundly impacted mathematical reasoning, particularly through the use of large language models (LLMs) for automated reasoning. A significant challenge in training LLMs for these formal languages is the lack of parallel datasets that align natural language with formal language proofs. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel framework for translating the Mathlib4 corpus (a unified library of mathematics in formal language Lean 4) into natural language. Building upon this, we employ a dual augmentation strategy that combines tactic-based and informal-based approaches, leveraging the Lean-jixia system, a Lean 4 analyzer. We present the results of this pipeline on Mathlib4 as Herald (Hierarchy and Retrieval-based Translated Lean Dataset). We also propose the Herald Translator, which is fine-tuned on Herald. Herald translator achieves a 96.7\% accuracy (Pass@128) on formalizing statements in the miniF2F-test and a 23.5\% accuracy on our internal graduate-level textbook dataset, outperforming InternLM2-Math-Plus-7B (73.0\% and 7.5\%) and TheoremLlama (50.1\% and 4.0\%). Furthermore, we propose a section-level translation framework for real-world applications. As a direct application of Herald translator, we have successfully translated a template section in the Stack project, marking a notable progress in the automatic formalization of graduate-level mathematical literature. Our model, along with the datasets, are open-sourced to the public."
Poster,HERO: Human-Feedback Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Online Diffusion Model Finetuning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27733,"Ayano Hiranaka, Shang-Fu Chen, Chieh-Hsin Lai, Dongjun Kim, Naoki Murata, Takashi Shibuya, WeiHsiang Liao, Shao-Hua Sun, Yuki Mitsufuji","Controllable generation through Stable Diffusion (SD) fine-tuning aims to improve fidelity, safety, and alignment with human guidance. Existing reinforcement learning from human feedback methods usually rely on predefined heuristic reward functions or pretrained reward models built on large-scale datasets, limiting their applicability to scenarios where collecting such data is costly or difficult. To effectively and efficiently utilize human feedback, we develop a framework, HERO, which leverages online human feedback collected on the fly during model learning. Specifically, HERO features two key mechanisms: (1) Feedback-Aligned Representation Learning, an online training method that captures human feedback and provides informative learning signals for fine-tuning, and (2) Feedback-Guided Image Generation, which involves generating images from SD's refined initialization samples, enabling faster convergence towards the evaluator's intent. We demonstrate that HERO is 4x more efficient in online feedback for body part anomaly correction compared to the best existing method. Additionally, experiments show that HERO can effectively handle tasks like reasoning, counting, personalization, and reducing NSFW content with only 0.5K online feedback.

Poster,Hessian Free Efficient Single Loop Iterative Differentiation Methods for Bi-Level Optimization Problems,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31463,"Peiran Yu, Junyi Li, Heng Huang","Bilevel optimization problems have been actively studied in recent machine learning research due to their broad applications. In this work, we investigate single-loop methods with iterative differentiation (ITD) for nonconvex bilevel optimization problems. For deterministic bilevel problems, we propose an efficient single-loop ITD-type method (ES-ITDM). Our method employs historical updates to approximate the hypergradient. More importantly, based on ES-ITDM, we propose a new method that avoids computing Hessians. This Hessian-free method requires fewer backpropagations and thus has a lower computational cost. We analyze the convergence properties of the proposed methods in two aspects. We provide the convergence rates of the sequences generated by ES-ITD based on the Kurdyka-\L ojasiewicz (KL) property. We also show that the Hessian-free stochastic ES-ITDM has the best-known complexity while has cheaper computation. The empirical studies show that our Hessian-free stochastic variant is more efficient than existing Hessian-free methods and other state-of-the-art bilevel optimization approaches."
Poster,Hessian-Free Online Certified Unlearning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30533,"Xinbao Qiao, Meng Zhang, Ming Tang, Ermin Wei","Machine unlearning strives to uphold the data owners' right to be forgotten by enabling models to selectively forget specific data. Recent advances suggest pre-computing and storing statistics extracted from second-order information and implementing unlearning through Newton-style updates.However, the Hessian matrix operations are extremely costly and previous works conduct unlearning for empirical risk minimizer with the convexity assumption, precluding their applicability to high-dimensional over-parameterized models and the nonconvergence condition.In this paper, we propose an efficient Hessian-free unlearning approach. The key idea is to maintain a statistical vector for each training data, computed through affine stochastic recursion of the difference between the retrained and learned models. We prove that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the unlearning and generalization guarantees, the deletion capacity, and the time/storage complexity, under the same regularity conditions.Through the strategy of recollecting statistics for removing data, we develop an online unlearning algorithm that achieves near-instantaneous data removal, as it requires only vector addition.Experiments demonstrate that our proposed scheme surpasses existing results by orders of magnitude in terms of time/storage costs with millisecond-level unlearning execution, while also enhancing test accuracy."
Poster,HexGen-2: Disaggregated Generative Inference of LLMs in Heterogeneous Environment,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30492,"YOUHE JIANG, Ran Yan, Binhang Yuan","Disaggregating the prefill and decoding phases represents an effective new paradigm for generative inference of large language models (LLM). This approach offers some significant system advantages, such as eliminating prefill-decoding interference and optimizing resource allocation. However, it is still an challenging open problem about how to deploy the disaggregated inference paradigm across a group of heterogeneous GPUs, which can be an economic alternative of the deployment over the homogeneous high performance GPUs.Towards this end, we introduce HexGen-2, a distributed system for high throughput and cost-efficient LLM serving on heterogeneous GPUs following the disaggragated paradigm. Built on top of HexGen, the core component of HexGen-2 is a sophisticated scheduling algorithm that formalizes the allocation of disaggregated LLM inference computations and communications over heterogeneous GPUs and network connections as a constraint optimization problem. We leverage the graph partitioning and max-flow algorithm to co-optimize resource allocation, parallel strategies for distinct inference phases, and the efficiency of inter-phase key-value (KV) cache communications. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate HexGen-2, i.e., on OPT (30B) and Llama-2 (70B) models in various real-world settings, the results reveal that HexGen-2 delivers up to a 2.0$\times$ and on average a 1.3$\times$ improvement in serving throughput, reduces the average inference latency by 1.5$\times$ compared with state-of-the-art systems given the same price budget, and achieves comparable inference performance with a 30% lower price budget."
Poster,HG-Adapter: Improving Pre-Trained Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks with Dual Adapters,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30642,"YUJIE MO, Runpeng Yu, Xiaofeng Zhu, Xinchao Wang","The ""pre-train, prompt-tuning'' paradigm has demonstrated impressive  performance for tuning pre-trained heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) by mitigating the gap between pre-trained models and downstream tasks. However, most prompt-tuning-based works may face at least two limitations: (i) the model may be insufficient to fit the graph structures well as they are generally ignored in the prompt-tuning stage, increasing the training error to decrease the generalization ability; and (ii) the model may suffer from the limited labeled data during the prompt-tuning stage, leading to a large generalization gap between the training error and the test error to further affect the model generalization. To alleviate the above limitations, we first derive the generalization error bound for existing prompt-tuning-based methods, and then propose a unified framework that combines two new adapters with potential labeled data extension to improve the generalization of pre-trained HGNN models. Specifically, we design dual structure-aware adapters to adaptively fit task-related homogeneous and heterogeneous structural information. We further design a label-propagated contrastive loss and two self-supervised losses to optimize dual adapters and incorporate unlabeled nodes as potential labeled data. Theoretical analysis indicates that the proposed method achieves a lower generalization error bound than existing methods, thus obtaining superior generalization ability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed method on different downstream tasks."
Poster,HGM³: Hierarchical Generative Masked Motion Modeling with Hard Token Mining,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30181,"Minjae Jeong, Yechan Hwang, Jaejin Lee, Sungyoon Jung, Won Hwa Kim","Text-to-motion generation has significant potential in a wide range of applications including animation, robotics, and AR/VR. While recent works on masked motion models are promising, the task remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity in text and the complexity of human motion dynamics. To overcome the issues, we propose a novel text-to-motion generation framework that integrates two key components: Hard Token Mining (HTM) and a Hierarchical Generative Masked Motion Model (HGM³). Our HTM identifies and masks challenging regions in motion sequences and directs the model to focus on hard-to-learn components for efficacy. Concurrently, the hierarchical model uses a semantic graph to represent sentences at different granularity, allowing the model to learn contextually feasible motions. By leveraging a shared-weight masked motion model, it reconstructs the same sequence under different conditioning levels and facilitates comprehensive learning of complex motion patterns. During inference, the model progressively generates motions by incrementally building up coarse-to-fine details. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including HumanML3D and KIT-ML, demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative measures for generating context-aware motions."
Poster,HiBug2: Efficient and Interpretable Error Slice Discovery for Comprehensive Model Debugging,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28538,"Muxi Chen, Chenchen Zhao, Qiang Xu","Despite the significant success of deep learning models in computer vision, they often exhibit systematic failures on specific data subsets, known as error slices. Identifying and mitigating these error slices is crucial to enhancing model robustness and reliability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce HiBug2, an automated framework for error slice discovery and model repair. HiBug2 first generates task-specific visual attributes to highlight instances prone to errors through an interpretable and structured process. It then employs an efficient slice enumeration algorithm to systematically identify error slices, overcoming the combinatorial challenges that arise during slice exploration. Additionally, HiBug2 extends its capabilities by predicting error slices beyond the validation set, addressing a key limitation of prior approaches. Extensive experiments across multiple domains — including image classification, pose estimation, and object detection — show that HiBug2 not only improves the coherence and precision of identified error slices but also significantly enhances the model repair capabilities."
