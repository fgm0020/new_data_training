Poster,GS-CPR: Efficient Camera Pose Refinement via 3D Gaussian Splatting,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28467,"Changkun Liu, Shuai Chen, Yash Bhalgat, Siyan HU, Ming Cheng, Zirui Wang, Victor Prisacariu, Tristan Braud","We leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a scene representation and propose a novel test-time camera pose refinement (CPR) framework, GS-CPR. This framework enhances the localization accuracy of state-of-the-art absolute pose regression and scene coordinate regression methods. The 3DGS model renders high-quality synthetic images and depth maps to facilitate the establishment of 2D-3D correspondences. GS-CPR obviates the need for training feature extractors or descriptors by operating directly on RGB images, utilizing the 3D foundation model, MASt3R, for precise 2D matching. To improve the robustness of our model in challenging outdoor environments, we incorporate an exposure-adaptive module within the 3DGS framework. Consequently, GS-CPR enables efficient one-shot pose refinement given a single RGB query and a coarse initial pose estimation. Our proposed approach surpasses leading NeRF-based optimization methods in both accuracy and runtime across indoor and outdoor visual localization benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracy on two indoor datasets."
Poster,GSE: Group-wise Sparse and Explainable Adversarial Attacks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29010,"Shpresim Sadiku, Moritz Wagner, Sebastian Pokutta","Sparse adversarial attacks fool deep neural networks (DNNs) through minimal pixel perturbations, often regularized by the $\ell_0$ norm. Recent efforts have replaced this norm with a structural sparsity regularizer, such as the nuclear group norm, to craft group-wise sparse adversarial attacks. The resulting perturbations are thus explainable and hold significant practical relevance, shedding light on an even greater vulnerability of DNNs. However, crafting such attacks poses an optimization challenge, as it involves computing norms for groups of pixels within a non-convex objective. We address this by presenting a two-phase algorithm that generates group-wise sparse attacks within semantically meaningful areas of an image. Initially, we optimize a quasinorm adversarial loss using the $1/2$-quasinorm proximal operator tailored for non-convex programming. Subsequently, the algorithm transitions to a projected Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent with $2$-norm regularization applied to perturbation magnitudes. Rigorous evaluations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate a remarkable increase in group-wise sparsity, e.g., $50.9\%$ on CIFAR-10 and $38.4\%$ on ImageNet (average case, targeted attack). This performance improvement is accompanied by significantly faster computation times, improved interpretability, and a $100\%$ attack success rate."
Poster,GS-LiDAR: Generating Realistic LiDAR Point Clouds with Panoramic Gaussian Splatting,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29653,"Junzhe Jiang, Chun Gu, Yurui Chen, Li Zhang","LiDAR novel view synthesis (NVS) has emerged as a novel task within LiDAR simulation, offering valuable simulated point cloud data from novel viewpoints to aid in autonomous driving systems. However, existing LiDAR NVS methods typically rely on neural radiance fields (NeRF) as their 3D representation, which incurs significant computational costs in both training and rendering. Moreover, NeRF and its variants are designed for symmetrical scenes, making them ill-suited for driving scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose GS-LiDAR, a novel framework for generating realistic LiDAR point clouds with panoramic Gaussian splatting. Our approach employs 2D Gaussian primitives with periodic vibration properties, allowing for precise geometric reconstruction of both static and dynamic elements in driving scenarios. We further introduce a novel panoramic rendering technique with explicit ray-splat intersection, guided by panoramic LiDAR supervision. By incorporating intensity and ray-drop spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients into the Gaussian primitives, we enhance the realism of the rendered point clouds. Extensive experiments on KITTI-360 and nuScenes demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of quantitative metrics, visual quality, as well as training and rendering efficiency."
Poster,GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30620,"Iman Mirzadeh, Keivan Alizadeh-Vahid, Hooman Shahrokhi, Oncel Tuzel, Samy Bengio, Mehrdad Farajtabar","Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their mathematical reasoning capabilities. While performance on the widely popular GSM8K benchmark has improved, questions remain about whether reported evaluation metrics are reliable, and reasoning abilities of LLMs have advanced. To overcome the limitations of existing evaluations, we introduce GSM-Symbolic, an improved benchmark created from symbolic templates that allow for the generation of a diverse set of questions. GSM-Symbolic enables more controllable evaluations, providing key insights and more reliable metrics for measuring the reasoning capabilities of models. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit noticeable variance when responding to different instantiations of the same question. Specifically, the performance of models declines when only the numerical values in the question are altered in the GSM-Symbolic benchmark. Furthermore, we investigate the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models and demonstrate that their performance significantly deteriorates as the number of clauses in a question increases. We hypothesize that this decline is due to the fact that current LLMs are not capable of genuine logical reasoning; instead, they attempt to replicate the reasoning steps observed in their training data. When we add a single clause that appears relevant to the question, we observe significant performance drops (up to 65%) across all state-of-the-art models, even though the added clause does not contribute to the reasoning chain needed to reach the final answer. Overall, our work provides a more nuanced understanding of LLMs' capabilities and limitations in mathematical reasoning."
Poster,GTR: Improving Large 3D Reconstruction Models through Geometry and Texture Refinement,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29787,"Peiye Zhuang, Songfang Han, Chaoyang Wang, Aliaksandr Siarohin, Jiaxu Zou, Michael Vasilkovsky, Vladislav Shakhrai, Sergei Korolev, Sergey Tulyakov, Hsin-Ying Lee","We propose a novel approach for 3D mesh reconstruction from multi-view images. We improve upon the large reconstruction model LRM that use a transformer-based triplane generator and a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) model trained on multi-view images. We introduce three key components to significantly enhance the 3D reconstruction quality. First of all, we examine the original LRM architecture and find several shortcomings. Subsequently, we introduce respective modifications to the LRM architecture, which lead to improved multi-view image representation and more computationally efficient training. Second, in order to improve geometry reconstruction and enable supervision at full image resolution, we extract meshes from the NeRF in a differentiable manner and fine-tune the NeRF model through mesh rendering. These modifications allow us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both 2D and 3D evaluation metrics on Google Scanned Objects (GSO) dataset and OmniObject3D dataset. Finally, we introduce a lightweight per-instance texture refinement procedure to better reconstruct complex textures, such as text and portraits on assets. To address this, we introduce a lightweight per-instance texture refinement procedure. This procedure fine-tunes the triplane representation and the NeRF's color estimation model on the mesh surface using the input multi-view images in just 4 seconds. This refinement achieves faithful reconstruction of complex textures. Additionally, our approach enables various downstream applications, including text/image-to-3D generation."
Poster,Guaranteed Generation from Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30739,"Minbeom Kim, Thibaut Thonet, Jos Rozen, Hwaran Lee, Kyomin Jung, Marc Dymetman","As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across various applications, there is a growing need to control text generation to satisfy specific constraints or requirements. This raises a crucial question: Is it possible to guarantee strict constraint satisfaction in generated outputs while preserving the distribution of the original model as much as possible? We first define the ideal distribution — the one closest to the original model, which also always satisfies the expressed constraint — as the ultimate goal of guaranteed generation. We then state a fundamental limitation, namely that it is impossible to reach that goal through autoregressive training alone. This motivates the necessity of combining training-time and inference-time methods to enforce such guarantees. Based on this insight, we propose GUARD, a simple yet effective approach that combines an autoregressive proposal distribution with rejection sampling. Through GUARD’s theoretical properties, we show how controlling the KL divergence between a specific proposal and the target ideal distribution simultaneously optimizes inference speed and distributional closeness. To validate these theoretical concepts, we conduct extensive experiments on two text generation settings with hard-to-satisfy constraints: a lexical constraint scenario and a sentiment reversal scenario. These experiments show that GUARD achieves perfect constraint satisfaction while almost preserving the ideal distribution with highly improved inference efficiency. GUARD provides a principled approach to enforcing strict guarantees for LLMs without compromising their generative capabilities."
Poster,Guided Score identity Distillation for Data-Free One-Step Text-to-Image Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30232,"Mingyuan Zhou, Zhendong Wang, Huangjie Zheng, Hai Huang","Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models trained on extensive text-image pairs have demonstrated the ability to produce photorealistic images aligned with textual descriptions. However, a significant limitation of these models is their slow sample generation process, which requires iterative refinement through the same network. To overcome this, we introduce a data-free guided distillation method that enables the efficient distillation of pretrained Stable Diffusion models without access to the real training data, often restricted due to legal, privacy, or cost concerns. This method enhances Score identity Distillation (SiD) with Long and Short Classifier-Free Guidance (LSG), an innovative strategy that applies Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) not only to the evaluation of the pretrained diffusion model but also to the training and evaluation of the fake score network. We optimize a model-based explicit score matching loss using a score-identity-based approximation alongside our proposed guidance strategies for practical computation. By exclusively training with synthetic images generated by its one-step generator, our data-free distillation method rapidly improves FID and CLIP scores, achieving state-of-the-art FID performance while maintaining a competitive CLIP score. Notably, the one-step distillation of Stable Diffusion 1.5 achieves an FID of **8.15** on the COCO-2014 validation set, a record low value under the data-free setting.  Our code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/SiD-LSG."
Poster,GUI-World: A Video Benchmark and Dataset for Multimodal GUI-oriented Understanding,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/32086,"Dongping Chen, Yue Huang, Siyuan Wu, Jingyu Tang, Huichi Zhou, Qihui Zhang, Zhigang He, Yilin Bai, Chujie Gao, Liuyi Chen, Yiqiang Li, Chenlong Wang, Yue Yu, Tianshuo Zhou, Zhen Li, Yi Gui, Yao Wan, Pan Zhou, Jianfeng Gao, Lichao Sun","Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been used as agents to control keyboard and mouse inputs by directly perceiving the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and generating corresponding commands.However, current agents primarily demonstrate strong understanding capabilities in static environments and are mainly applied to relatively simple domains, such as Web or mobile interfaces.We argue that a robust GUI agent should be capable of perceiving temporal information on the GUI, including dynamic Web content and multi-step tasks.Additionally, it should possess a comprehensive understanding of various GUI scenarios, including desktop software and multi-window interactions.To this end, this paper introduces a new dataset, termed GUI-World, which features meticulously crafted Human-MLLM annotations, extensively covering six GUI scenarios and eight types of GUI-oriented questions in three formats.We evaluate the capabilities of current state-of-the-art MLLMs, including Image LLMs and Video LLMs, in understanding various types of GUI content, especially dynamic and sequential content. Our findings reveal that current models struggle with dynamic GUI content without manually annotated keyframes or operation history. On the other hand, Video LLMs fall short in all GUI-oriented tasks given the sparse GUI video dataset. Therefore, we take the initial step of leveraging a fine-tuned Video LLM, GUI-Vid, as a GUI-oriented assistant, demonstrating an improved understanding of various GUI tasks. However, due to the limitations in the performance of base LLMs, we conclude that using video LLMs as GUI agents remains a significant challenge. We believe our work provides valuable insights for future research in dynamic GUI content understanding. All the dataset and code are publicly available at: https://gui-world.github.io."
Poster,Gumbel Counterfactual Generation From Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29541,"Shauli Ravfogel, Anej Svete, Vésteinn Snæbjarnarson, Ryan Cotterell","Understanding and manipulating the causal generation mechanisms in language models is essential for controlling their behavior. Previous work has primarily relied on techniques such as representation surgery---e.g., model ablations or manipulation of linear subspaces tied to specific concepts---to intervene on these models. To understand the impact of interventions precisely, it is useful to examine counterfactuals---e.g., how a given sentence would have appeared had it been generated by the model following a specific intervention. We highlight that counterfactual reasoning is conceptually distinct from interventions, as articulated in Pearl's causal hierarchy. Based on this observation, we propose a framework for generating true string counterfactuals by reformulating language models as a structural equation model using the Gumbel-max trick, which we called Gumbel counterfactual generation. This reformulation allows us to model the joint distribution over original strings and their counterfactuals resulting from the same instantiation of the sampling noise. We develop an algorithm based on hindsight Gumbel sampling that allows us to infer the latent noise variables and generate counterfactuals of observed strings. Our experiments demonstrate that the approach produces meaningful counterfactuals while at the same time showing that commonly used intervention techniques have considerable undesired side effects."
Poster,Gyrogroup Batch Normalization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29016,"Ziheng Chen, Yue Song, Xiaojun Wu, Nicu Sebe","Several Riemannian manifolds in machine learning, such as Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD), Grassmann, spherical, and hyperbolic manifolds, have been proven to admit gyro structures, thus enabling a principled and effective extension of Euclidean Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to manifolds. Inspired by this, this study introduces a general Riemannian Batch Normalization (RBN) framework on gyrogroups, termed GyroBN. We identify the least requirements to guarantee GyroBN with theoretical control over sample statistics, referred to as \textit{pseudo-reduction} and \textit{gyroisometric gyrations}, which are satisfied by all the existing gyrogroups in machine learning. Besides, our GyroBN incorporates several existing normalization methods, including the one on general Lie groups and different types of RBN on the non-group SPD geometry. Lastly, we instantiate our GyroBN on the Grassmannian and hyperbolic spaces. Experiments on the Grassmannian and hyperbolic networks demonstrate the effectiveness of our GyroBN. The code is available at https://github.com/GitZH-Chen/GyroBN.git."
