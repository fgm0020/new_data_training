Poster,Sharper Guarantees for Learning Neural Network Classifiers with Gradient Methods,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28778,"Hossein Taheri, Christos Thrampoulidis, Arya Mazumdar","In this paper, we study the data-dependent convergence and generalization behavior of gradient methods for neural networks with smooth activation. Our first result is a novel bound on the excess risk of deep networks trained by the logistic loss via an alogirthmic stability analysis. Compared to previous works, our results improve upon the shortcomings of the well-established Rademacher complexity-based bounds. Importantly, the bounds we derive in this paper are tighter, hold even for neural networks of small width, do not scale unfavorably with width, are algorithm-dependent, and consequently capture the role of initialization on the sample complexity of gradient descent for deep nets. Specialized to noiseless data separable with margin $\gamma$ by neural tangent kernel (NTK) features of a network of width $\Omega(poly(\log(n)))$, we show the test-error rate $e^{O(L)}/{\gamma^2 n}$, where $n$ is the training set size and $L$ denotes the number of hidden layers. This results in an improvement in the test loss bound compared to previous works while maintaining the poly-logarithmic width conditions. We further investigate excess risk bounds for deep nets trained with noisy data, establishing that under a polynomial condition on the network width, gradient descent can achieve the optimal excess risk. Finally, we show that a large step-size significantly improves upon the NTK regime's results in classifying the XOR distribution. In particular, we show for a one-hidden layer neural network of constant width $m$ with quadratic activation and standard Gaussian initialization that SGD with linear sample complexity and with a large step-size $\eta=m$ reaches the perfect test accuracy after only $\lceil\log(d)\rceil$ iterations, where $d$ is the data dimension."
Poster,Sharpness-Aware Black-Box Optimization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28779,"Feiyang YE, YUEMING LYU, Xuehao Wang, Masashi Sugiyama, Yu Zhang, Ivor Tsang","Black-box optimization algorithms have been widely used in various machine learning problems, including reinforcement learning and prompt fine-tuning. However, directly optimizing the training loss value, as commonly done in existing black-box optimization methods, could lead to suboptimal model quality and generalization performance. To address those problems in black-box optimization, we propose a novel Sharpness-Aware Black-box Optimization (SABO) algorithm, which applies a sharpness-aware minimization strategy to improve the model generalization. Specifically, the proposed SABO method first reparameterizes the objective function by its expectation over a Gaussian distribution. Then it iteratively updates the parameterized distribution by approximated stochastic gradients of the maximum objective value within a small neighborhood around the current solution in the Gaussian distribution space. Theoretically, we prove the convergence rate and generalization bound of the proposed SABO algorithm. Empirically, extensive experiments on the black-box prompt fine-tuning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SABO method in improving model generalization performance."
Poster,Sharpness-Aware Minimization Efficiently Selects Flatter Minima Late In Training,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29182,"Zhanpeng Zhou, Mingze Wang, Yuchen Mao, Bingrui Li, Junchi Yan","Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has substantially improved the generalization of neural networks under various settings. Despite the success, its effectiveness remains poorly understood. In this work, we discover an intriguing phenomenon in the training dynamics of SAM, shedding light on understanding its implicit bias towards flatter minima over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Specifically, we find that *SAM efficiently selects flatter minima late in training*. Remarkably, even a few epochs of SAM applied at the end of training yield nearly the same generalization and solution sharpness as full SAM training. Subsequently, we delve deeper into the underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon. Theoretically, we identify two phases in the learning dynamics after applying SAM late in training: i) SAM first escapes the minimum found by SGD exponentially fast; and ii) then rapidly converges to a flatter minimum within the same valley. Furthermore, we empirically investigate the role of SAM during the early training phase. We conjecture that the optimization method chosen in the late phase is more crucial in shaping the final solution's properties. Based on this viewpoint, we extend our findings from SAM to Adversarial Training."
Poster,Sharpness-Aware Minimization: General Analysis and Improved Rates,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30738,"Dimitris Oikonomou, Nicolas Loizou","Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has emerged as a powerful method for improving generalization in machine learning models by minimizing the sharpness of the loss landscape. However, despite its success, several important questions regarding the convergence properties of SAM in non-convex settings are still open, including the benefits of using normalization in the update rule, the dependence of the analysis on the restrictive bounded variance assumption, and the convergence guarantees under different sampling strategies. To address these questions, in this paper, we provide a unified analysis of SAM and its unnormalized variant (USAM) under one single flexible update rule (Unified SAM), and we present convergence results of the new algorithm under a relaxed and more natural assumption on the stochastic noise. Our analysis provides convergence guarantees for SAM under different step size selections for non-convex problems and functions that satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition (a non-convex generalization of strongly convex functions). The proposed theory holds under the arbitrary sampling paradigm, which includes importance sampling as special case, allowing us to analyze variants of SAM that were never explicitly considered in the literature. Experiments validate the theoretical findings and further demonstrate the practical effectiveness of Unified SAM in training deep neural networks for image classification tasks."
Poster,Shedding Light on Time Series Classification using Interpretability Gated Networks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28432,"Yunshi Wen, Tengfei Ma, Ronny Luss, Debarun Bhattacharjya, Achille Fokoue, Anak Agung Julius","In time-series classification, interpretable models can bring additional insights but be outperformed by deep models since human-understandable features have limited expressivity and flexibility. In this work, we present InterpGN, a framework that integrates an interpretable model and a deep neural network. Within this framework, we introduce a novel gating function design based on the confidence of the interpretable expert, preserving interpretability for samples where interpretable features are significant while also identifying samples that require additional expertise. For the interpretable expert, we incorporate shapelets to effectively model shape-level features for time-series data. We introduce a variant of Shapelet Transforms to build logical predicates using shapelets. Our proposed model achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art deep learning models while additionally providing interpretable classifiers for various benchmark datasets. We further show that our models improve on quantitative shapelet quality and interpretability metrics over existing shapelet-learning formulations. Finally, we show that our models can integrate additional advanced architectures and be applied to real-world tasks beyond standard benchmarks such as the MIMIC-III and time series extrinsic regression datasets."
Poster,"ShEPhERD: Diffusing shape, electrostatics, and pharmacophores for bioisosteric drug design",https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30057,"Keir Adams, Kento Abeywardane, Jenna Fromer, Connor Coley","Engineering molecules to exhibit precise 3D intermolecular interactions with their environment forms the basis of chemical design. In ligand-based drug design, bioisosteric analogues of known bioactive hits are often identified by virtually screening chemical libraries with shape, electrostatic, and pharmacophore similarity scoring functions. We instead hypothesize that a generative model which learns the joint distribution over 3D molecular structures and their interaction profiles may facilitate 3D interaction-aware chemical design. We specifically design ShEPhERD, an SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model which jointly diffuses/denoises 3D molecular graphs and representations of their shapes, electrostatic potential surfaces, and (directional) pharmacophores to/from Gaussian noise. Inspired by traditional ligand discovery, we compose 3D similarity scoring functions to assess ShEPhERD’s ability to conditionally generate novel molecules with desired interaction profiles. We demonstrate ShEPhERD’s potential for impact via exemplary drug design tasks including natural product ligand hopping, protein-blind bioactive hit diversification, and bioisosteric fragment merging."
Poster,"Shh, don't say that! Domain Certification in LLMs",https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30364,"Cornelius Emde, Alasdair Paren, Preetham Arvind, Maxime Kayser, Tom Rainforth, Thomas Lukasiewicz, Philip Torr, Adel Bibi","Large language models (LLMs) are often deployed to do constrained tasks, with narrow domains. For example, customer support bots can be built on top of LLMs, relying on their broad language understanding and capabilities to enhance performance. However, these LLMs are adversarially susceptible, potentially generating outputs outside the intended domain. To formalize, assess and mitigate this risk, we introduce domain certification; a guarantee that accurately characterizes the out-of-domain behavior of language models. We then propose a simple yet effective approach dubbed VALID that provides adversarial bounds as a certificate. Finally, we evaluate our method across a diverse set of datasets, demonstrating that it yields meaningful certificates."
Poster,Shifting the Paradigm: A Diffeomorphism Between Time Series Data Manifolds for Achieving Shift-Invariancy in Deep Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28398,"Berken Utku Demirel, Christian Holz","Deep learning models lack shift invariance, making them sensitive to input shifts that cause changes in output. While recent techniques seek to address this for images, our findings show that these approaches fail to provide shift-invariance in time series, where the data generation mechanism is more challenging due to the interaction of low and high frequencies. Worse, they also decrease performance across several tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel differentiable bijective function that maps samples from their high-dimensional data manifold to another manifold of the same dimension, without any dimensional reduction. Our approach guarantees that samples---when subjected to random shifts---are mapped to a unique point in the manifold while preserving all task-relevant information without loss. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that the proposed transformation guarantees shift-invariance in deep learning models without imposing any limits to the shift. Our experiments on six time series tasks with state-of-the-art methods show that our approach consistently improves the performance while enabling models to achieve complete shift-invariance without modifying or imposing restrictions on the model's topology. The source code is available on GitHub."
Poster,ShortcutsBench: A Large-Scale Real-world Benchmark for API-based Agents,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28594,"Haiyang SHEN, Yue Li, Desong Meng, Dongqi Cai, Sheng Qi, Li Zhang, Mengwei Xu, Yun Ma","Recent advancements in integrating large language models (LLMs) with application programming interfaces (APIs) have gained significant interest in both academia and industry. Recent work demonstrates that these API-based agents exhibit relatively strong autonomy and planning capabilities. However, their ability to handle multi-dimensional difficulty levels, diverse task types, and real-world demands remains unknown. In this paper, we introduce ShortcutsBench, a large-scale benchmark for the comprehensive evaluation of API-based agents in solving real-world complex tasks. ShortcutsBench includes a wealth of real APIs from Apple Inc., refined user queries, human-annotated high-quality action sequences, detailed parameter filling values, and parameters requesting necessary input from the system or user. We put in significant effort in collecting and processing the data. We revealed how existing benchmarks / datasets struggle to accommodate the advanced reasoning capabilities of existing more intelligent LLMs. Moreover, our extensive evaluation of agents built with 5 leading open-source (size >= 57B) and 5 closed-source LLMs (e.g. Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o-mini) reveals significant limitations of existing API-based agents in the whole process of handling complex queries related to API selection, parameter filling, and requesting necessary input from the system and the user. These findings highlight the great challenges that API-based agents face in effectively fulfilling real and complex user queries.

Poster,Shot2Story: A New Benchmark for Comprehensive Understanding of Multi-shot Videos,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30335,"Mingfei Han, Linjie Yang, Xiaojun Chang, Lina Yao, Heng Wang","A short clip of video may contain progression of multiple events and an interesting story line. A human need to capture both the event in every shot and associate them together to understand the story behind it. In this work, we present a new multi-shot video understanding benchmark \dataset with detailed shot-level captions, comprehensive video summaries and question-answering pairs. To facilitate better semantic understanding of videos, we provide captions for both visual signals and human narrations. We design several distinct tasks including single-shot video captioning, multi-shot video summarization, and multi-shot video question answering. Preliminary experiments show some challenges to generate a long and comprehensive video summary for multi-shot videos. Nevertheless, the generated imperfect summaries can already achieve competitive performance on existing video understanding tasks such as video question-answering, promoting an under-explored setting of video understanding with detailed summaries."
