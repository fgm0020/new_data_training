Poster,On the Benefits of Attribute-Driven Graph Domain Adaptation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28080,"Ruiyi Fang, Bingheng Li, zhao kang, Qiuhao Zeng, Nima Hosseini Dashtbayaz, Ruizhi Pu, Charles Ling, Boyu Wang","Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) addresses a pressing challenge in cross-network learning, particularly pertinent due to the absence of labeled data in real-world graph datasets. Recent studies attempted to learn domain invariant representations by eliminating structural shifts between graphs. In this work, we show that existing methodologies have overlooked the significance of the graph node attribute, a pivotal factor for graph domain alignment. Specifically, we first reveal the impact of node attributes for GDA by theoretically proving that in addition to the graph structural divergence between the domains, the node attribute discrepancy also plays a critical role in GDA. Moreover, we also empirically show that the attribute shift is more substantial than the topology shift, which further underscore the importance of node attribute alignment in GDA. Inspired by this finding, a novel cross-channel module is developed to fuse and align both views between the source and target graphs for GDA. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark verify the effectiveness of our method."
Poster,On the Benefits of Memory for Modeling Time-Dependent PDEs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28374,"Ricardo Buitrago Ruiz, Tanya Marwah, Albert Gu, Andrej Risteski","Data-driven techniques  have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional numerical methods for solving PDEs. For time-dependent PDEs, many approaches are Markovian---the evolution of the trained system only depends on the current state, and not the past states. In this work, we investigate the benefits of using memory for modeling time-dependent PDEs: that is, when past states are explicitly used to predict the future. Motivated by the Mori-Zwanzig theory of model reduction, we theoretically exhibit examples of simple (even linear) PDEs, in which a solution that uses memory is arbitrarily better than a Markovian solution. Additionally, we introduce Memory Neural Operator (MemNO), a neural operator architecture that combines recent state space models (specifically, S4) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) to effectively model memory.  We empirically demonstrate that when the PDEs are supplied in low resolution or contain observation noise at train and test time, MemNO significantly outperforms the baselines without memory---with up to $6 \times$ reduction in test error. Furthermore, we show that this benefit is particularly pronounced when the PDE solutions have significant high-frequency Fourier modes (e.g., low-viscosity fluid dynamics) and we construct a challenging benchmark dataset consisting of such PDEs."
Poster,On the Byzantine-Resilience of Distillation-Based Federated Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28341,"Christophe Roux, Max Zimmer, Sebastian Pokutta","Federated Learning (FL) algorithms using Knowledge Distillation (KD) have received increasing attention due to their favorable properties with respect to privacy, non-i.i.d. data and communication cost. These methods depart from transmitting model parameters and instead communicate information about a learning task by sharing predictions on a public dataset. In this work, we study the performance of such approaches in the byzantine setting, where a subset of the clients act in an adversarial manner aiming to disrupt the learning process. We show that KD-based FL algorithms are remarkably resilient and analyze how byzantine clients can influence the learning process. Based on these insights, we introduce two new byzantine attacks and demonstrate their ability to break existing byzantine-resilient methods. Additionally, we propose a novel defence method which enhances the byzantine resilience of KD-based FL algorithms. Finally, we provide a general framework to obfuscate attacks, making them significantly harder to detect, thereby improving their effectiveness."
Poster,On the Completeness of Invariant Geometric Deep Learning Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30973,"Zian Li, Xiyuan Wang, Shijia Kang, Muhan Zhang","Invariant models, one important class of geometric deep learning models, are capable of generating meaningful geometric representations by leveraging informative geometric features in point clouds. These models are characterized by their simplicity, good experimental results and computational efficiency. However, their theoretical expressive power still remains unclear, restricting a deeper understanding of the potential of such models. In this work, we concentrate on characterizing the theoretical expressiveness of a wide range of invariant models under *fully-connected* conditions. We first rigorously characterize the expressiveness of the most classic invariant model, message-passing neural networks incorporating distance (DisGNN), restricting its unidentifiable cases to be only highly symmetric point clouds. We then prove that GeoNGNN, the geometric counterpart of one of the simplest subgraph graph neural networks, can effectively break these corner cases' symmetry and thus achieve E(3)-completeness. By leveraging GeoNGNN as a theoretical tool, we further prove that: 1) most subgraph GNNs developed in traditional graph learning can be seamlessly extended to geometric scenarios with E(3)-completeness; 2) DimeNet, GemNet and SphereNet, three well-established invariant models, are also all capable of achieving E(3)-completeness. Our theoretical results fill the gap in the expressive power of invariant models, contributing to a rigorous and comprehensive understanding of their capabilities."
Poster,On the Computation of the Fisher Information in Continual Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31332,Gido van de Ven,"One of the most popular methods for continual learning with deep neural networks is Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), which involves computing the Fisher Information. The exact way in which the Fisher Information is computed is however rarely described, and multiple different implementations for it can be found online. This blog post discusses and empirically compares several often-used implementations, which highlights that many currently reported results for EWC could likely be improved by changing the way the Fisher Information is computed."
Poster,On the Convergence of Adaptive Gradient Methods for Nonconvex Optimization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31499,"Quanquan Gu, Jinghui Chen, Yuan Cao, Ziyan Yang, Dongruo Zhou","Adaptive gradient methods are workhorses in deep learning. However, the convergence guarantees of adaptive gradient methods for nonconvex optimization have not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we provide a fine-grained convergence analysis for a general class of adaptive gradient methods including AMSGrad, RMSProp and AdaGrad. For smooth nonconvex functions, we prove that adaptive gradient methods in expectation converge to a first-order stationary point. Our convergence rate is better than existing results for adaptive gradient methods in terms of dimension. In addition, we also prove high probability bounds on the convergence rates of AMSGrad, RMSProp as well as AdaGrad, which have not been established before. Our analyses shed light on better understanding the mechanism behind adaptive gradient methods in optimizing nonconvex objectives."
Poster,On the Convergence of No-Regret Dynamics in Information Retrieval Games with Proportional Ranking Functions,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28641,"Omer Madmon, Idan Pipano, Itamar Jacob Reinman, Moshe Tennenholtz","Publishers who publish their content on the web act strategically, in a behavior that can be modeled within the online learning framework. Regret, a central concept in machine learning, serves as a canonical measure for assessing the performance of learning agents within this framework.We prove that any proportional content ranking function with a concave activation function induces games in which no-regret learning dynamics converge. Moreover, for proportional ranking functions, we prove the equivalence of the concavity of the activation function, the social concavity of the induced games and the concavity of the induced games.We also study the empirical trade-offs between publishers' and users' welfare, under different choices of the activation function, using a state-of-the-art no-regret dynamics algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the choice of the ranking function and changes in the ecosystem structure affect these welfare measures, as well as the dynamics' convergence rate."
Poster,On the Crucial Role of Initialization for Matrix Factorization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29262,"Bingcong Li, Liang Zhang, Aryan Mokhtari, Niao He","This work revisits the classical low-rank matrix factorization problem and unveils the critical role of initialization in shaping convergence rates for such nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization. We introduce Nystrom initialization, which significantly improves the global convergence of Scaled Gradient Descent (ScaledGD) in both symmetric and asymmetric matrix factorization tasks. Specifically, we prove that ScaledGD with Nystrom initialization achieves quadratic convergence in cases where only linear rates were previously known. Furthermore, we extend this initialization to low-rank adapters (LoRA) commonly used for finetuning foundation models. Our approach, NoRA, i.e., LoRA with Nystrom initialization, demonstrates superior performance across various downstream tasks and model scales, from 1B to 7B parameters, in large language and diffusion models."
Poster,On the expressiveness and spectral bias of KANs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27709,"Yixuan Wang, Jonathan Siegel, Ziming Liu, Thomas Hou","Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) \cite{liu2024kan} were very recently proposed as a potential alternative to the prevalent architectural backbone of many deep learning models, the multi-layer perceptron (MLP). KANs have seen success in various tasks of AI for science, with their empirical efficiency and accuracy demonstrated in function regression, PDE solving, and many more scientific problems. In this article, we revisit the comparison of KANs and MLPs, with emphasis on a theoretical perspective. On the one hand, we compare the representation and approximation capabilities of KANs and MLPs. We establish that MLPs can be represented using KANs of a comparable size. This shows that the approximation and representation capabilities of KANs are at least as good as MLPs. Conversely, we show that KANs can be represented using MLPs, but that in this representation the number of parameters increases by a factor of the KAN grid size. This suggests that KANs with a large grid size may be more efficient than MLPs at approximating certain functions. On the other hand, from the perspective of learning and optimization, we study the spectral bias of KANs compared with MLPs. We demonstrate that KANs are less biased toward low frequencies than MLPs. We highlight that the multi-level learning feature specific to KANs, i.e. grid extension of splines, improves the learning process for high-frequency components.  Detailed comparisons with different choices of depth, width, and grid sizes of KANs are made, shedding some light on how to choose the hyperparameters in practice."
Poster,On the Expressiveness of Rational ReLU Neural Networks With Bounded Depth,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27977,"Gennadiy Averkov, Christopher Hojny, Maximilian Merkert","To confirm that the expressive power of ReLU neural networks grows with their depth, the function $F_n = \max (0,x_1,\ldots,x_n )$ has been considered in the literature.  A conjecture by Hertrich, Basu, Di Summa, and Skutella [NeurIPS 2021] states that any ReLU network that exactly represents $F_n$ has at least $\lceil \log_2 (n+1) \rceil$ hidden layers.  The conjecture has recently been confirmed for networks with integer weights by Haase, Hertrich, and Loho [ICLR 2023].  We follow up on this line of research and show that, within ReLU networks whose weights are decimal fractions, $F_n$ can only be represented by networks with at least $\lceil \log_3 (n+1) \rceil$ hidden layers.  Moreover, if all weights are $N$-ary fractions, then $F_n$ can only be represented by networks with at least $\Omega( \frac{\ln n}{\ln \ln N})$ layers.  These results are a  partial confirmation of the above conjecture for rational ReLU networks, and provide the first non-constant lower bound on the depth of practically relevant ReLU networks."
