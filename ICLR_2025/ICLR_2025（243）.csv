Poster,On Discriminative Probabilistic Modeling for Self-Supervised Representation Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28153,"Bokun Wang, Yunwen Lei, Yiming Ying, Tianbao Yang","We study the discriminative probabilistic modeling on a continuous domain for the data prediction task of (multimodal) self-supervised representation learning. To address the challenge of computing the integral in the partition function for each anchor data, we leverage the multiple importance sampling (MIS) technique for robust Monte Carlo integration, which can recover InfoNCE-based contrastive loss as a special case. Within this probabilistic modeling framework, we conduct generalization error analysis to reveal the limitation of current InfoNCE-based contrastive loss for self-supervised representation learning and derive insights for developing better approaches by reducing the error of Monte Carlo integration. To this end, we propose a novel non-parametric method for approximating the sum of conditional probability densities required by MIS through convex optimization, yielding a new contrastive objective for self-supervised representation learning. Moreover, we design an efficient algorithm for solving the proposed objective. We empirically compare our algorithm to representative baselines on the contrastive image-language pretraining task. Experimental results on the CC3M and CC12M datasets demonstrate the superior overall performance of our algorithm. Our code is available at https://github.com/bokun-wang/NUCLR."
Poster,On Disentangled Training for Nonlinear Transform in Learned Image Compression,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29489,"Han Li, Shaohui Li, Wenrui Dai, Maida Cao, Nuowen Kan, Chenglin Li, Junni Zou, Hongkai Xiong","Learned image compression (LIC) has demonstrated superior rate-distortion (R-D) performance compared to traditional codecs, but is challenged by training inefficiency that could incur more than two weeks to train a state-of-the-art model from scratch. Existing LIC methods overlook the slow convergence caused by compacting energy in learning nonlinear transforms. In this paper, we first reveal that such energy compaction consists of two components, \emph{i.e.}, feature decorrelation and uneven energy modulation. On such basis, we propose a linear auxiliary transform (AuxT) to disentangle energy compaction in training nonlinear transforms. The proposed AuxT obtains coarse approximation to achieve efficient energy compaction such that distribution fitting with the nonlinear transforms can be simplified to fine details. We then develop wavelet-based linear shortcuts (WLSs) for AuxT that leverages wavelet-based downsampling and orthogonal linear projection for feature decorrelation and subband-aware scaling for uneven energy modulation. AuxT is lightweight and plug-and-play to be integrated into diverse LIC models to address the slow convergence issue. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accelerate training of LIC models by 2  times and simultaneously achieves an average 1\% BD-rate reduction. To our best knowledge, this is one of the first successful attempt that can significantly improve the convergence of LIC with comparable or superior rate-distortion performance."
Poster,One for all and all for one: Efficient computation of partial Wasserstein distances on the line,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28547,"Laetitia Chapel, Romain Tavenard","Partial Wasserstein helps overcoming some of the limitations of Optimal Transport when the distributions at stake differ in mass, contain noise or outliers or exhibit mass mismatches across distribution modes.We introduce PAWL, a novel algorithm designed to efficiently compute exact PArtial Wasserstein distances on the Line. PAWL not only solves the partial transportation problem for a specified amount of mass to be transported, but _for all_ admissible mass amounts. This flexibility is valuable for machine learning tasks where the level of noise is uncertain and needs to be determined through cross-validation, for example. By achieving $O(n \log n)$ time complexity for the partial 1-Wasserstein problem on the line, it enables practical applications with large scale datasets. Additionally, we introduce a novel slicing strategy tailored to Partial Wasserstein, which does not permit transporting mass between outliers or noisy data points. We demonstrate the advantages of PAWL in terms of computational efficiency and performance in downstream tasks, outperforming existing (sliced) Partial Optimal Transport techniques."
Poster,One-for-All Few-Shot Anomaly Detection via Instance-Induced Prompt Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29190,"Wenxi Lv, Qinliang Su, Wenchao Xu","Anomaly detection methods under the 'one-for-all' paradigm aim to develop a unified model capable of detecting anomalies across multiple classes. However, these approaches typically require a large number of normal samples for model training, which may not always be feasible in practice. Few-shot anomaly detection methods can address scenarios with limited data but often require a tailored model for each class, struggling within the 'one-for-one' paradigm. In this paper, we first proposed the one-for-all few-shot anomaly detection method with the assistance of vision-language model. Different from previous CLIP-based methods learning fix prompts for each class, our method learn a class-shared prompt generator to adaptively generate suitable prompt for each instance. The prompt generator is trained by aligning the prompts with the visual space and utilizing guidance from general textual descriptions of normality and abnormality. Furthermore, we address the mismatch problem of the memory bank within one-for-all paradigm. Extensive experimental results on MVTec and VisA demonstrate the superiority of our method in few-shot anomaly detection task under the one-for-all paradigm."
Poster,One Hundred Neural Networks and Brains Watching Videos: Lessons from Alignment,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30005,"Christina Sartzetaki, Gemma Roig, Cees G Snoek, Iris Groen","What can we learn from comparing video models to human brains, arguably the most efficient and effective video processing systems in existence? Our work takes a step towards answering this question by performing the first large-scale benchmarking of deep video models on representational alignment to the human brain, using publicly available models and a recently released video brain imaging (fMRI) dataset. We disentangle four factors of variation in the models (temporal modeling, classification task, architecture, and training dataset) that affect alignment to the brain, which we measure by conducting Representational Similarity Analysis across multiple brain regions and model layers. We show that temporal modeling is key for alignment to brain regions involved in early visual processing, while a relevant classification task is key for alignment to higher-level regions. Moreover, we identify clear differences between the brain scoring patterns across layers of CNNs and Transformers, and reveal how training dataset biases transfer to alignment with functionally selective brain areas. Additionally, we uncover a negative correlation of computational complexity to brain alignment. Measuring a total of 99 neural networks and 10 human brains watching videos, we aim to forge a path that widens our understanding of temporal and semantic video representations in brains and machines, ideally leading towards more efficient video models and more mechanistic explanations of processing in the human brain."
Poster,One Model Transfer to All: On Robust Jailbreak Prompts Generation against LLMs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28127,"Linbao Li, Yannan Liu, Daojing He, YU LI","Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly compromised by jailbreak attacks, which can manipulate these models to generate harmful or unintended content. Investigating these attacks is crucial for uncovering model vulnerabilities. However, many existing jailbreak strategies fail to keep pace with the rapid development of defense mechanisms, such as defensive suffixes, rendering them ineffective against defended models. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel attack method called ArrAttack, specifically designed to target defended LLMs. ArrAttack automatically generates robust jailbreak prompts capable of bypassing various defense measures. This capability is supported by a universal robustness judgment model that, once trained, can perform robustness evaluation for any target model with a wide variety of defenses. By leveraging this model, we can rapidly develop a robust jailbreak prompt generator that efficiently converts malicious input prompts into effective attacks. Extensive evaluations reveal that ArrAttack significantly outperforms existing attack strategies, demonstrating strong transferability across both white-box and black-box models, including GPT-4 and Claude-3. Our work bridges the gap between jailbreak attacks and defenses, providing a fresh perspective on generating robust jailbreak prompts."
Poster,One-Prompt-One-Story: Free-Lunch Consistent Text-to-Image Generation Using a Single Prompt,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29063,"Tao Liu, Kai Wang, Senmao Li, Joost van de Weijer, Fahad Khan, Shiqi Yang, Yaxing Wang, Jian Yang, Ming-Ming Cheng","Text-to-image generation models can create high-quality images from input prompts. However, they struggle to support the consistent generation of identity-preserving requirements for storytelling. Existing approaches to this problem typically require extensive training in large datasets or additional modifications to the original model architectures. This limits their applicability across different domains and diverse diffusion model configurations. In this paper, we first observe the inherent capability of language models, coined $\textit{context consistency}$, to comprehend identity through context with a single prompt. Drawing inspiration from the inherent $\textit{context consistency}$, we propose a novel $\textit{training-free}$ method for consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation, termed ""One-Prompt-One-Story"" ($\textit{1Prompt1Story}$). Our approach $\textit{1Prompt1Story}$ concatenates all prompts into a single input for T2I diffusion models, initially preserving character identities. We then refine the generation process using two novel techniques: $\textit{Singular-ValueReweighting}$ and $\textit{Identity-Preserving Cross-Attention}$, ensuring better alignment with the input description for each frame. In our experiments, we compare our method against various existing consistent T2I generation approaches to demonstrate its effectiveness, through quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments. Code is available at https://github.com/byliutao/1Prompt1Story."
Poster,One Step Diffusion via Shortcut Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29802,"Kevin Frans, Danijar Hafner, Sergey Levine, Pieter Abbeel","Diffusion models and flow matching models have enabled generating diverse and realistic images by learning to transfer noise to data. However, sampling from these models involves iterative denoising over many neural network passes, making generation slow and expensive. Previous approaches for speeding up sampling require complex training regimes, such as multiple training phases, multiple networks, or fragile scheduling. We introduce Shortcut Models, a family of generative models that use a single network and training phase to produce high-quality samples in a single or multiple sampling steps. Shortcut models condition the network not only on the current noise level but also on the desired step size, allowing the model to skip ahead in the generation process. Across a wide range of sampling step budgets, shortcut models consistently produce higher quality samples than previous approaches, such as consistency models and reflow. Compared to distillation, shortcut models reduce complexity to a single network and training phase and additionally allow varying step budgets at inference time."
Poster,On Evaluating the Durability of Safeguards for Open-Weight LLMs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28875,"Xiangyu Qi, Boyi Wei, Nicholas Carlini, Yangsibo Huang, Tinghao Xie, Luxi He, Matthew Jagielski, Milad Nasr, Prateek Mittal, Peter Henderson","Many stakeholders---from model developers to policymakers---seek to minimize the risks of large language models (LLMs). Key to this goal is whether technical safeguards can impede the misuse of LLMs, even when models are customizable via fine-tuning or when model weights are openly available. Several recent studies have proposed methods to produce durable LLM safeguards for open-weight LLMs that can withstand adversarial modifications of the model's weights via fine-tuning. This holds the promise of raising adversaries' costs even under strong threat models where adversaries can directly fine-tune parameters.  However, we caution against over-reliance on such methods in their current state. Through several case studies, we demonstrate that even the evaluation of these defenses is exceedingly difficult and can easily mislead audiences into thinking that safeguards are more durable than they really are. We draw lessons from the failure modes that we identify and suggest that future research carefully cabin claims to more constrained, well-defined, and rigorously examined threat models, which can provide useful and candid assessments to stakeholders."
Poster,On Generalization Across Environments In Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28013,"Jayden Teoh, Pradeep Varakantham, Peter Vamplew","Real-world sequential decision-making tasks often require balancing trade-offs between multiple conflicting objectives, making Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) an increasingly prominent field of research. Despite recent advances, existing MORL literature has narrowly focused on performance within static environments, neglecting the importance of generalizing across diverse settings. Conversely, existing research on generalization in RL has always assumed scalar rewards, overlooking the inherent multi-objectivity of real-world problems. Generalization in the multi-objective context is fundamentally more challenging, as it requires learning a Pareto set of policies addressing varying preferences across multiple objectives. In this paper, we formalize the concept of generalization in MORL and how it can be evaluated. We then contribute a novel benchmark featuring diverse multi-objective domains with parameterized environment configurations to facilitate future studies in this area. Our baseline evaluations of state-of-the-art MORL algorithms on this benchmark reveals limited generalization capabilities, suggesting significant room for improvement. Our empirical findings also expose limitations in the expressivity of scalar rewards, emphasizing the need for multi-objective specifications to achieve effective generalization. We further analyzed the algorithmic complexities within current MORL approaches that could impede the transfer in performance from the single- to multiple-environment settings. This work fills a critical gap and lays the groundwork for future research that brings together two key areas in reinforcement learning: solving multi-objective decision-making problems and generalizing across diverse environments. We make our code available at [https://github.com/JaydenTeoh/MORL-Generalization](https://github.com/JaydenTeoh/MORL-Generalization)."
