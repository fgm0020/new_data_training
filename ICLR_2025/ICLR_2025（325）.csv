Poster,Steering Large Language Models between Code Execution and Textual Reasoning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30940,"Yongchao Chen, Harsh Jhamtani, Srinagesh Sharma, Chuchu Fan, Chi Wang","While a lot of recent research focuses on enhancing the textual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by optimizing the multi-agent framework or reasoning chains, several benchmark tasks can be solved with 100\% success through direct coding, which is more scalable and avoids the computational overhead associated with textual iterating and searching. Textual reasoning has inherent limitations in solving tasks with challenges in math, logics, optimization, and searching, which is unlikely to be solved by simply scaling up the model and data size. The recently released OpenAI GPT Code Interpreter and multi-agent frameworks such as AutoGen have demonstrated remarkable proficiency of integrating code generation and execution to solve complex tasks using LLMs. However, based on our experiments on 7 existing popular methods for steering code/text generation in both single- and multi-turn settings with 14 tasks and 6 types of LLMs (including the new O1-preview), currently there is no optimal method to correctly steer LLMs to write code when needed. We discover some interesting patterns on when models use code vs. textual reasoning with the evolution to task complexity and model sizes, which even result in an astonishingly inverse scaling behavior. We also discover that results from LLM written code are not always better than using textual reasoning, even if the task could be solved through code. To mitigate the above issues, we propose three methods to better steer LLM code/text generation and achieve a notable improvement. The costs of token lengths and runtime are thoroughly discussed for all the methods. We believe the problem of steering LLM code/text generation is critical for future research and has much space for further improvement.

Poster,Steering LLMs' Behavior with Concept Activation Vectors,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/37630,"Ruixuan HUANG, Shuai Wang","Concept activation vectors have been shown to take effects in safety concepts, efficiently and effectively guiding a considerable number of open-source large language models (LLMs) to respond positively to malicious instructions. In this blog, we aim to explore the capability boundaries of concept activation vectors in guiding various behaviors of LLMs through more extensive experiments. Our experiments demonstrate that this reasoning technique can low-costly transfer text styles and improve performance on specific tasks such as code generation."
Poster,Steering Masked Discrete Diffusion Models via Discrete Denoising Posterior Prediction,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29801,"Jarrid Rector-Brooks, Mohsin Hasan, Zhangzhi Peng, Chenghao Liu, Sarthak Mittal, Nouha Dziri, Michael Bronstein, Pranam Chatterjee, Alexander Tong, Joey Bose","Generative modeling of discrete data underlies important applications spanning text-based agents like ChatGPT to the design of the very building blocks of life in protein sequences. However, application domains need to exert control over the generated data by steering the generative process—typically via RLHF—to satisfy a specified property, reward, or affinity metric. In this paper, we study the problem of steering Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), a recent class of discrete diffusion models that offer a compelling alternative to traditional autoregressive models. We introduce Discrete Denoising Posterior Prediction (DDPP), a novel framework that casts the task of steering pretrained MDMs as a problem of probabilistic inference by learning to sample from a target Bayesian posterior. Our DDPP framework leads to a family of three novel objectives that are all simulation-free, and thus scalable while applying to general non-differentiable reward functions. Empirically, we instantiate DDPP by steering MDMs to perform class-conditional pixel-level image modeling, RLHF-based alignment of MDMs using text based rewards, and finetuning protein language models to generate more diverse secondary structures and shorter proteins. We substantiate our designs via wet-lab validation, where we observe transient expression of reward-optimized protein sequences."
Poster,Steering Protein Family Design through Profile Bayesian Flow,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29753,"Jingjing Gong, Yu Pei, Siyu Long, Yuxuan Song, Zhe Zhang, Wenhao Huang, Ziyao Cao, Shuyi Zhang, Hao Zhou, Wei-Ying Ma","Protein family design emerges as a promising alternative by combining the advantages of de novo protein design and mutation-based directed evolution.In this paper, we propose ProfileBFN, the Profile Bayesian Flow Networks, for specifically generative modeling of protein families. ProfileBFN extends the discrete Bayesian Flow Network from an MSA profile perspective, which can be trained on single protein sequences by regarding it as a degenerate profile, thereby achieving efficient protein family design by avoiding large-scale MSA data construction and training. Empirical results show that ProfileBFN has a profound understanding of proteins. When generating diverse and novel family proteins, it can accurately capture the structural characteristics of the family. The enzyme produced by this method is more likely than the previous approach to have the corresponding function, offering better odds of generating diverse proteins with the desired functionality."
Poster,Stem-OB: Generalizable Visual Imitation Learning with Stem-Like Convergent Observation through Diffusion Inversion,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27776,"Kaizhe Hu, Zihang Rui, Yao He, Yuyao Liu, Pu Hua, Huazhe Xu","Visual imitation learning methods demonstrate strong performance, yet they lack generalization when faced with visual input perturbations like variations in lighting and textures. This limitation hampers their practical application in real-world settings. To address this, we propose ***Stem-OB*** that leverages the inversion process of pretrained image diffusion models to suppress low-level visual differences while maintaining high-level scene structures. This image inversion process is akin to transforming the observation into a shared representation, from which other observations also stem. *Stem-OB* offers a simple yet effective plug-and-play solution that stands in contrast to data augmentation approaches. It demonstrates robustness to various unspecified appearance changes without the need for additional training. We provide theoretical insights and empirical results that validate the efficacy of our approach in simulated and real settings. *Stem-OB* shows an exceptionally significant improvement in real-world robotic tasks, where challenging light and appearance changes are present, with an average increase of **22.2%** in success rates compared to the best baseline.

Poster,Step-by-Step Reasoning for Math Problems  via Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29208,"Shengyu Feng, Xiang Kong, shuang ma, Aonan Zhang, Dong Yin, Chong Wang, Ruoming Pang, Yiming Yang","Augmenting the multi-step reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a persistent challenge. Recently, verification has shown promise in improving solution consistency by evaluating generated outputs. However, current verification approaches suffer from sampling inefficiencies, requiring a large number of samples to achieve satisfactory performance. Additionally, training an effective verifier often depends on extensive process supervision, which is costly to acquire. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a novel verification method based on Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (TSMC). TSMC sequentially refines its sampling effort to focus exploration on promising candidates, resulting in more efficient generation of high-quality solutions. We apply TSMC to LLMs by estimating the expected future rewards at partial solutions. This approach results in a more straightforward training target that eliminates the need for step-wise human annotations. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of our method across multiple math benchmarks, and also validate our theoretical analysis of both our approach and existing verification methods."
Poster,ST-GCond: Self-supervised and Transferable Graph Dataset Condensation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27835,"Beining Yang, Qingyun Sun, Cheng Ji, Xingcheng Fu, Jianxin Li","The increasing scale of graph datasets significantly enhances deep learning models but also presents substantial training challenges. Graph dataset condensation has emerged to condense large datasets into smaller yet informative ones that maintain similar test performance. However, these methods require downstream usage to match the original dataset and task, which is impractical in real-world scenarios. Our empirical studies show that existing methods fail in ""cross-task"" and ""cross-dataset"" scenarios, often performing worse than training from scratch. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method: Self-supervised and Transferable Graph dataset Condensation (ST-GCond). For cross-task transferability, we propose a task-disentangled meta optimization strategy to adaptively update the condensed graph according to the task relevance, encouraging information preservation for various tasks. For cross-dataset transferability, we propose a multi-teacher self-supervised optimization strategy to incorporate auxiliary self-supervised tasks to inject universal knowledge into the condensed graph. Additionally, we incorporate mutual information guided joint condensation mitigating the potential conflicts and ensure the condensing stability. Experiments on both node-level and graph-level datasets show that ST-GCond outperforms existing methods by 2.5% to 18.7% in all cross-task and cross-dataset scenarios, and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5 out of 6 datasets in the single dataset and task scenario."
Poster,Stiefel Flow Matching for Moment-Constrained Structure Elucidation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30787,"Austin H Cheng, Alston Lo, Kin Long Kelvin Lee, Santiago Miret, Alan Aspuru-Guzik","Molecular structure elucidation is a fundamental step in understanding chemical phenomena, with applications in identifying molecules in natural products, lab syntheses, forensic samples, and the interstellar medium.We consider the task of predicting a molecule's all-atom 3D structure given only its molecular formula and moments of inertia, motivated by the ability of rotational spectroscopy to measure these moments.While existing generative models can conditionally sample 3D structures with approximately correct moments, this soft conditioning fails to leverage the many digits of precision afforded by experimental rotational spectroscopy.To address this, we first show that the space of $n$-atom point clouds with a fixed set of moments of inertia is embedded in the Stiefel manifold $\mathrm{St}(n, 4)$.We then propose Stiefel Flow Matching as a generative model for elucidating 3D structure under exact moment constraints.Additionally, we learn simpler and shorter flows by finding approximate solutions for equivariant optimal transport on the Stiefel manifold.Empirically, enforcing exact moment constraints allows Stiefel Flow Matching to achieve higher success rates and faster sampling than Euclidean diffusion models, even on high-dimensional manifolds corresponding to large molecules in the GEOM dataset."
Poster,Stochastic Bandits Robust to Adversarial Attacks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27916,"Xuchuang Wang, Maoli Liu, Jinhang Zuo, Xutong Liu, John C.S. Lui, Mohammad Hajiesmaili","This paper investigates stochastic multi-armed bandit algorithms that are robust to adversarial attacks, where an attacker can first observe the learner's action and *then* alter their reward observation.We study two cases of this model, with or without the knowledge of an attack budget $C$, defined as an upper bound of the summation of the difference between the actual and altered rewards. For both cases, we devise two types of algorithms with regret bounds having additive or multiplicative $C$ dependence terms.For the known attack budget case, we prove our algorithms achieve the regret bound of ${O}((K/\Delta)\log T + KC)$ and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{KTC})$ for the additive and multiplicative $C$ terms, respectively, where $K$ is the number of arms, $T$ is the time horizon, $\Delta$ is the gap between the expected rewards of the optimal arm and the second-best arm, and $\tilde{O}$ hides the logarithmic factors.For the unknown case, we prove our algorithms achieve the regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{KT} + KC^2)$ and $\tilde{O}(KC\sqrt{T})$ for the additive and multiplicative $C$ terms, respectively.In addition to these upper bound results, we provide several lower bounds showing the tightness of our bounds and the optimality of our algorithms.These results delineate an intrinsic separation between the bandits with attacks and corruption models."
Poster,Stochastic Polyak Step-sizes and Momentum: Convergence Guarantees and Practical Performance,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28388,"Dimitris Oikonomou, Nicolas Loizou","Stochastic gradient descent with momentum, also known as Stochastic Heavy Ball method (SHB), is one of the most popular algorithms for solving large-scale stochastic optimization problems in various machine learning tasks. In practical scenarios, tuning the step-size and momentum parameters of the method is a prohibitively expensive and time-consuming process. In this work, inspired by the recent advantages of stochastic Polyak step-size in the performance of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we propose and explore new Polyak-type variants suitable for the update rule of the SHB method. In particular, using the Iterate Moving Average (IMA) viewpoint of SHB, we propose and analyze three novel step-size selections: MomSPSmax, MomDecSPS, and MomAdaSPS. For MomSPSmax, we provide convergence guarantees for SHB to a neighborhood of the solution for convex and smooth problems (without assuming interpolation). If interpolation is also satisfied, then using MomSPSmax, SHB converges to the true solution at a fast rate matching the deterministic HB. The other two variants, MomDecSPS and MomAdaSPS, are the first adaptive step-size for SHB that guarantee convergence to the exact minimizer - without a priori knowledge of the problem parameters and without assuming interpolation. Our convergence analysis of SHB is tight and obtains the convergence guarantees of stochastic Polyak step-size for SGD as a special case. We supplement our analysis with experiments validating our theory and demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithms."
