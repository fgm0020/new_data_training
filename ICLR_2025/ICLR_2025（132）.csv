Poster,From Decoupling to Adaptive Transformation: a Wider Optimization Space for PTQ,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30116,"Zhaojing Wen, Qiulin Zhang, Yuan Zhang, Rudan Chen, Xichao Yang, Di Xie, Jiang Zhu","Post-Training low-bit Quantization (PTQ) is useful to accelerate DNNs due to its high efficiency, the current SOTAs of which mostly adopt feature reconstruction with self-distillation finetuning. However, when bitwidth goes to be extremely low, we find the current reconstruction optimization space is not optimal. Considering all possible parameters and the ignored fact that integer weight can be obtained early before actual inference, we thoroughly explore different optimization space by quant-step decoupling, where a wider PTQ optimization space, which consistently makes a better optimum, is found out. Based on these, we propose an Adaptive Quantization Transformation (AdaQTransform) for PTQ reconstruction,  which makes the quantized output feature better fit the FP32 counterpart with adaptive per-channel transformation, thus achieves lower feature reconstruction error.  In addition,  it incurs negligible extra finetuning cost and no extra inference cost. Based on AdaQTransform, for the first time, we build a general quantization setting paradigm subsuming current PTQs, QATs and other potential forms. Experiments demonstrate AdaQTransform expands the optimization space for PTQ and helps current PTQs find a better optimum over CNNs, ViTs, LLMs and image super-resolution networks,  e.g., it improves NWQ by 5.7% on ImageNet for W2A2-MobileNet-v2."
Poster,From Exploration to Mastery: Enabling LLMs to Master Tools via Self-Driven Interactions,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29696,"Changle Qu, Sunhao Dai, Xiaochi Wei, Hengyi Cai, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Jun Xu, Ji-Rong Wen","Tool learning enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external environments by invoking tools, serving as an effective strategy to mitigate the limitations inherent in their pre-training data. In this process, tool documentation plays a crucial role by providing usage instructions for LLMs, thereby facilitating effective tool utilization. This paper concentrates on the critical challenge of bridging the comprehension gap between LLMs and external tools due to the inadequacies and inaccuracies inherent in existing human-centric tool documentation. We propose a novel framework, DRAFT, aimed at Dynamically Refining tool documentation through the Analysis of Feedback and Trials emanating from LLMs' interactions with external tools. This methodology pivots on an innovative trial-and-error approach, consisting of three distinct learning phases: experience gathering, learning from experience, and documentation rewriting, to iteratively enhance the tool documentation. This process is further optimized by implementing a diversity-promoting exploration strategy to ensure explorative diversity and a tool-adaptive termination mechanism to prevent overfitting while enhancing efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DRAFT's iterative, feedback-based refinement significantly ameliorates documentation quality, fostering a deeper comprehension and more effective utilization of tools by LLMs. Notably, our analysis reveals that the tool documentation refined via our approach demonstrates robust cross-model generalization capabilities."
Poster,From Few to Many: Self-Improving Many-Shot Reasoners Through Iterative Optimization and Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30122,"Xingchen Wan, Han Zhou, Ruoxi Sun, Sercan Arik","Recent advances in long-context large language models (LLMs) have led to the emerging paradigm of many-shot in-context learning (ICL), where it is observed that scaling many more demonstrating examples beyond the conventional few-shot setup in the context can lead to performance benefits. However, despite its promise, it is unclear what aspects dominate the benefits and whether simply scaling to more examples is the most effective way of improving many-shot ICL. In this work, we first provide an analysis on the factors driving many-shot ICL, and we find that 1) many-shot performance can still be attributed to often a few disproportionately influential examples and 2) identifying such influential examples (""optimize"") and using them as demonstrations to regenerate new examples (""generate"") can lead to further improvements. Inspired by the findings, we propose BRIDGE, an algorithm that alternates between the optimize step with Bayesian optimization to discover the influential sets of examples and the generate step to reuse this set to expand the reasoning paths of the examples back to the many-shot regime automatically. On Gemini, Claude, and Mistral LLMs of different sizes, we show BRIDGE led to significant improvements across a diverse set of tasks including symbolic reasoning, numerical reasoning and code generation."
Poster,From GNNs to Trees: Multi-Granular Interpretability for Graph Neural Networks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30070,"Jie Yang, Yuwen Wang, Kaixuan Chen, Tongya Zheng, Yihe Zhou, Zhenbang Xiao, Ji Cao, Mingli Song, Shunyu Liu","Interpretable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) aim to reveal the underlying reasoning behind model predictions, attributing their decisions to specific subgraphs that are informative. However, existing subgraph-based interpretable methods suffer from an overemphasis on local structure, potentially overlooking long-range dependencies within the entire graphs. Although recent efforts that rely on graph coarsening have proven beneficial for global interpretability, they inevitably reduce the graphs to a fixed granularity. Such an inflexible way can only capture graph connectivity at a specific level, whereas real-world graph tasks often exhibit relationships at varying granularities (e.g., relevant interactions in proteins span from functional groups, to amino acids, and up to protein domains). In this paper, we introduce a novel Tree-like Interpretable Framework (TIF) for graph classification, where plain GNNs are transformed into hierarchical trees, with each level featuring coarsened graphs of different granularity as tree nodes. Specifically, TIF iteratively adopts a graph coarsening module to compress original graphs  (i.e., root nodes of trees) into increasingly coarser ones (i.e., child nodes of trees), while preserving diversity among tree nodes within different branches through a dedicated graph perturbation module. Finally, we propose an adaptive routing module to identify the most informative root-to-leaf paths, providing not only the final prediction but also the multi-granular interpretability for the decision-making process. Extensive experiments on the graph classification benchmarks with both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of TIF in interpretability, while also delivering a competitive prediction performance akin to the state-of-the-art counterparts."
Poster,From Isolated Conversations to Hierarchical Schemas: Dynamic Tree Memory Representation for LLMs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28447,"Alireza Rezazadeh, Zichao Li, Wei Wei, Yujia Bao","Recent advancements in large language models have significantly improved their context windows, yet challenges in effective long-term memory management remain. We introduce MemTree, an algorithm that leverages a dynamic, tree-structured memory representation to optimize the organization, retrieval, and integration of information, akin to human cognitive schemas. MemTree organizes memory hierarchically, with each node encapsulating aggregated textual content, corresponding semantic embeddings, and varying abstraction levels across the tree's depths. Our algorithm dynamically adapts this memory structure by computing and comparing semantic embeddings of new and existing information to enrich the model’s context-awareness. This approach allows MemTree to handle complex reasoning and extended interactions more effectively than traditional memory augmentation methods, which often rely on flat lookup tables. Evaluations on benchmarks for multi-turn dialogue understanding and document question answering show that MemTree significantly enhances performance in scenarios that demand structured memory management."
Poster,From Layers to States: A State Space Model Perspective to Deep Neural Network Layer Dynamics,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28443,"Qinshuo Liu, Weiqin Zhao, Wei Huang, Yanwen Fang, Lequan Yu, Guodong Li","The depth of neural networks is a critical factor for their capability, with deeper models often demonstrating superior performance. Motivated by this, significant efforts have been made to enhance layer aggregation - reusing information from previous layers to better extract features at the current layer, to improve the representational power of deep neural networks. However, previous works have primarily addressed this problem from a discrete-state perspective which is not suitable as the number of network layers grows. This paper novelly treats the outputs from layers as states of a continuous process and considers leveraging the state space model (SSM) to design the aggregation of layers in very deep neural networks. Moreover, inspired by its advancements in modeling long sequences,  the Selective State Space Models (S6) is employed to design a new module called Selective State Space Model Layer Aggregation (S6LA). This module aims to combine traditional CNN or transformer architectures within a sequential framework, enhancing the representational capabilities of state-of-the-art vision networks. Extensive experiments show that S6LA delivers substantial improvements in both image classification and detection tasks, highlighting the potential of integrating SSMs with contemporary deep learning techniques."
Poster,From Lazy to Rich: Exact Learning Dynamics in Deep Linear Networks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29214,"Clementine Domine, Nicolas Anguita, Alexandra M Proca, Lukas Braun, Daniel Kunin, Pedro Mediano, Andrew Saxe","Biological and artificial neural networks develop internal representations that enable them to perform complex tasks. In artificial networks, the effectiveness of these models relies on their ability to build task specific representation, a process influenced by interactions among datasets, architectures, initialization strategies, and optimization algorithms. Prior studies highlight that different initializations can place networks in either a lazy regime, where representations remain static, or a rich/feature learning regime, where representations evolve dynamically. Here, we examine how initialization influences learning dynamics in deep linear neural networks, deriving exact solutions for lambda-balanced initializations-defined by the relative scale of weights across layers. These solutions capture the evolution of representations and the Neural Tangent Kernel across the spectrum from the rich to the lazy regimes. Our findings deepen the theoretical understanding of the impact of weight initialization on learning regimes, with implications for continual learning, reversal learning, and transfer learning, relevant to both neuroscience and practical applications."
Poster,From Models to Microtheories: Distilling a Model's Topical Knowledge for Grounded Question-Answering,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30107,"Nathaniel Weir, Bhavana Dalvi Mishra, Orion Weller, Oyvind Tafjord, Sam Hornstein, Alexander Sabol, Peter Jansen, Ben Van Durme, Peter Clark","Recent reasoning methods (e.g., chain-of-thought) help users understand how language models (LMs) answer a single question, but they do little to reveal the LM’s overall understanding, or “theory,” about the question’s topic, making it still hard to trust the model. Our goal is to materialize such theories - here called microtheories (a linguistic analog of logical microtheories) - as a set of sentences encapsulating an LM’s core knowledge about a topic. These statements systematically work together to entail answers to a set of questions to both engender trust and improve performance. Our approach is to first populate a knowledge store with (model-generated) sentences that entail answers to training questions, and then distill those down to a core microtheory which is concise, general, and non-redundant. We show that, when added to a general corpus (e.g., Wikipedia), microtheories can supply critical information not necessarily present in the corpus, improving both a model’s ability to ground its answers to verifiable knowledge (i.e., show how answers are systematically entailed by documents in the corpus, grounding up to +8% more answers), and the accuracy of those grounded answers (up to +8% absolute). We also show that, in a human evaluation in the medical domain, our distilled microtheories contain a significantly higher concentration of topically critical facts than the non-distilled knowledge store. Finally, we show we can quantify the coverage of a microtheory for a topic (characterized by a dataset) using a notion of p-relevance. Together, these suggest that microtheories are an efficient distillation of an LM’s topic-relevant knowledge, that they can usefully augment existing corpora, and can provide both performance gains and an interpretable, verifiable window into the model’s knowledge of a topic."
Poster,From Pixels to Tokens: Byte-Pair Encoding on Quantized Visual Modalities,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31074,"Wanpeng Zhang, Zilong Xie, Yicheng Feng, Yijiang Li, Xingrun Xing, Sipeng Zheng, Zongqing Lu","Multimodal Large Language Models have made significant strides in integrating visual and textual information, yet they often struggle with effectively aligning these modalities. We introduce a novel image tokenizer that bridges this gap by applying the principle of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) to visual data. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on separate visual encoders, our method directly incorporates structural prior information into image tokens, mirroring the successful tokenization strategies used in text-only Large Language Models. This innovative approach enables Transformer models to more effectively learn and reason across modalities. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BPE Image Tokenizer significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal understanding capabilities, even with limited training data. Leveraging this method, we develop Being-VL-0, a model that demonstrates superior performance across various benchmarks and shows promising scalability, potentially paving the way for more efficient and capable multimodal foundation models.

Poster,From Probability to Counterfactuals: the Increasing Complexity of Satisfiability in Pearl's Causal Hierarchy,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28162,"Julian Dörfler, Benito van der Zander, Markus Bläser, Maciej Liśkiewicz","The framework of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH) formalizes three types of reasoning: probabilistic (i.e. purely observational), interventional, and counterfactual, that reflect the progressive sophistication of human thought regarding causation. We investigate the computational complexity aspects of reasoning in this framework focusing mainly on satisfiability problems expressed in probabilistic and causal languages across the PCH. That is, given a system of formulas in the standard probabilistic and causal languages, does there exist a model satisfying the formulas?  Our main contribution is to prove the exact computational complexities showing that languages allowing addition and marginalization (via the summation operator) yield NP^{PP}-, PSPACE-, and NEXP-complete satisfiability problems, depending on the level of the PCH. These are the first results to demonstrate a strictly increasing complexity across the PCH: from probabilistic to causal and counterfactual reasoning. On the other hand, in the case of full languages, i.e.~allowing addition, marginalization, and multiplication, we show that the satisfiability for the counterfactual level remains the same as for the probabilistic and causal levels, solving an open problem in the field."
