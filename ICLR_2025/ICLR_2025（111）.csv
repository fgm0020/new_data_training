Poster,Endowing Visual Reprogramming with Adversarial Robustness,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29796,"Shengjie Zhou, Xin Cheng, Haiyang Xu, Ming Yan, Tao Xiang, Feng Liu, Lei Feng","Visual reprogramming (VR) leverages well-developed pre-trained models (e.g., a pre-trained classifier on ImageNet) to tackle target tasks (e.g., a traffic sign recognition task), without the need for training from scratch. Despite the effectiveness of previous VR methods, all of them did not consider the adversarial robustness of reprogrammed models against adversarial attacks, which could lead to unpredictable problems in safety-crucial target tasks. In this paper, we empirically find that reprogramming pre-trained models with adversarial robustness and incorporating adversarial samples from the target task during reprogramming can both improve the adversarial robustness of reprogrammed models. Furthermore, we propose a theoretically guaranteed adversarial robustness risk upper bound for VR, which validates our empirical findings and could provide a theoretical foundation for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by adopting the strategies revealed in our empirical findings, the adversarial robustness of reprogrammed models can be enhanced."
Poster,End-to-end Learning of Gaussian Mixture Priors for Diffusion Sampler,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28690,"Denis Blessing, Xiaogang Jia, Gerhard Neumann","Diffusion models optimized via variational inference (VI) have emerged as a promising tool for generating samples from unnormalized target densities. These models create samples by simulating a stochastic differential equation, starting from a simple, tractable prior, typically a Gaussian distribution. However, when the support of this prior differs greatly from that of the target distribution, diffusion models often struggle to explore effectively or suffer from large discretization errors. Moreover, learning the prior distribution can lead to mode-collapse, exacerbated by the mode-seeking nature of reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence commonly used in VI.To address these challenges, we propose end-to-end learnable Gaussian mixture priors (GMPs). GMPs offer improved control over exploration, adaptability to target support, and increased expressiveness to counteract mode collapse. We further leverage the structure of mixture models by proposing a strategy to iteratively refine the model through the addition of mixture components during training. Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements across a diverse range of real-world and synthetic benchmark problems when using GMPs without requiring additional target evaluations."
Poster,E(n) Equivariant Topological Neural Networks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30602,"Claudio Battiloro, Ege Karaismailoglu, Mauricio Tec, George Dasoulas, Michelle Audirac, Francesca Dominici","Graph neural networks excel at modeling pairwise interactions, but they cannot flexibly accommodate higher-order interactions and features. Topological deep learning (TDL) has emerged recently as a promising tool for addressing this issue. TDL enables the principled modeling of arbitrary multi-way, hierarchical higher-order interactions by operating on combinatorial topological spaces, such as simplicial or cell complexes, instead of graphs. However, little is known about how to leverage geometric features such as positions and velocities for TDL. This paper introduces E(n)-Equivariant Topological Neural Networks (ETNNs), which are E(n)-equivariant message-passing networks operating on combinatorial complexes, formal objects unifying graphs, hypergraphs, simplicial, path, and cell complexes. ETNNs incorporate geometric node features while respecting rotation, reflection, and translation equivariance. Moreover, being TDL models, ETNNs are natively ready for settings with heterogeneous interactions.  We provide a theoretical analysis to show the improved expressiveness of ETNNs over architectures for geometric graphs. We also show how E(n)-equivariant variants of TDL models can be directly derived from our framework. The broad applicability of ETNNs is demonstrated through two tasks of vastly different scales: i) molecular property prediction on the QM9 benchmark and ii) land-use regression for hyper-local estimation of air pollution with multi-resolution irregular geospatial data.  The results indicate that ETNNs are an effective tool for learning from diverse types of richly structured data, as they match or surpass SotA equivariant TDL models with a significantly smaller computational burden, thus highlighting the benefits of a principled geometric inductive bias. Our implementation of ETNNs can be found at https://github.com/NSAPH-Projects/topological-equivariant-networks."
Poster,Energy-based Backdoor Defense Against Federated Graph Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30953,"Guancheng Wan, Zitong Shi, Wenke Huang, Guibin Zhang, Dacheng Tao, Mang Ye","Federated Graph Learning is rapidly evolving as a privacy-preserving collaborative approach. However, backdoor attacks are increasingly undermining federated systems by injecting carefully designed triggers that lead to the model making incorrect predictions. Trigger structures and injection locations in Federated Graph Learning are more diverse, making traditional federated defense methods less effective. In our work, we propose an effective Federated Graph Backdoor Defense using Topological Graph Energy (FedTGE). At the local client level, it injects distribution knowledge into the local model, assigning low energy to benign samples and high energy to the constructed malicious substitutes, and selects benign clients through clustering. At the global server level, the energy elements uploaded by each client are treated as new nodes to construct a global energy graph for energy propagation, making the selected clients' energy elements more similar and further adjusting the aggregation weights. Our method can handle high data heterogeneity, does not require a validation dataset, and is effective under both small and large malicious proportions. Extensive results on various settings of federated graph scenarios under backdoor attacks validate the effectiveness of this approach."
Poster,Energy-Based Diffusion Language Models for Text Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28133,"Minkai Xu, Tomas Geffner, Karsten Kreis, Weili Nie, Yilun Xu, Jure Leskovec, Stefano Ermon, Arash Vahdat","Despite remarkable progress in autoregressive language models, alternative generative paradigms beyond left-to-right generation are still being actively explored. Discrete diffusion models, with the capacity for parallel generation, have recently emerged as a promising alternative. Unfortunately, these models still underperform the autoregressive counterparts, with the performance gap increasing when reducing the number of sampling steps. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is a consequence of an imperfect approximation used by diffusion models. In this work, we propose Energy-based Diffusion Language Model (EDLM), an energy-based model operating at the full sequence level for each diffusion step, introduced to improve the underlying approximation used by diffusion models. More specifically, we introduce an EBM in a residual form, and show that its parameters can be obtained by leveraging a pretrained autoregressive model or by finetuning a bidirectional transformer via noise contrastive estimation. We also propose an efficient generation algorithm via parallel important sampling. Comprehensive experiments on language modeling benchmarks show that our model can consistently outperform state-of-the-art diffusion models by a significant margin, and approaches autoregressive models' perplexity. We further show that, without any generation performance drop, our framework offers a 1.3x sampling speedup over existing diffusion models.

Poster,Energy-Weighted Flow Matching for Offline Reinforcement Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30241,"Shiyuan Zhang, Weitong Zhang, Quanquan Gu","This paper investigates energy guidance in generative modeling, where the target distribution is defined as $q(\mathbf x) \propto p(\mathbf x)\exp(-\beta \mathcal E(\mathbf x))$, with $p(\mathbf x)$ being the data distribution and $\mathcal E(\mathbf x)$ as the energy function. To comply with energy guidance, existing methods often require auxiliary procedures to learn intermediate guidance during the diffusion process. To overcome this limitation, we explore energy-guided flow matching, a generalized form of the diffusion process. We introduce energy-weighted flow matching (EFM), a method that directly learns the energy-guided flow without the need for auxiliary models. Theoretical analysis shows that energy-weighted flow matching accurately captures the guided flow. Additionally, we extend this methodology to energy-weighted diffusion models and apply it to offline reinforcement learning (RL) by proposing the Q-weighted Iterative Policy Optimization (QIPO). Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed QIPO algorithm improves performance in offline RL tasks. Notably, our algorithm is the first energy-guided diffusion model that operates independently of auxiliary models and the first exact energy-guided flow matching model in the literature."
Poster,Enhanced Diffusion Sampling via Extrapolation with Multiple ODE Solutions,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28214,"Jinyoung Choi, Junoh Kang, Bohyung Han","Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs), while effective in generating high-quality samples, often suffer from high computational costs due to their iterative sampling process. To address this, we propose an enhanced ODE-based sampling method for DPMs inspired by Richardson extrapolation, which reduces numerical error and improves convergence rates. Our method, RX-DPM, leverages multiple ODE solutions at intermediate time steps to extrapolate the denoised prediction in DPMs. Our method, RX-DPM, leverages multiple ODE solutions at intermediate time steps to extrapolate the denoised prediction in DPMs. This significantly enhances the accuracy of estimations for the final sample while maintaining the number of function evaluations (NFEs). Unlike standard Richardson extrapolation, which assumes uniform discretization of the time grid, we develop a more general formulation tailored to arbitrary time step scheduling, guided by local truncation error derived from a baseline sampling method. The simplicity of our approach facilitates accurate estimation of numerical solutions without significant computational overhead, and allows for seamless and convenient integration into various DPMs and solvers. Additionally, RX-DPM provides explicit error estimates, effectively demonstrating the faster convergence as the leading error term's order increases. Through a series of experiments, we show that the proposed method improves the quality of generated samples without requiring additional sampling iterations."
Poster,Enhance Multi-View Classification Through Multi-Scale Alignment and Expanded Boundary,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28081,"Yuena Lin, Yiyuan Wang, Gengyu Lyu, Yongjian Deng, Haichun Cai, Huibin Lin, Haobo Wang, Zhen Yang","Multi-view classification aims at unifying the data from multiple views to complementarily enhance the classification performance. Unfortunately, two major problems in multi-view data are damaging model performance. The first is feature heterogeneity, which makes it hard to fuse features from different views. Considering this, we introduce a multi-scale alignment module, including an instance-scale alignment module and a prototype-scale alignment module to mine the commonality from an inter-view perspective and an inter-class perspective respectively, jointly alleviating feature heterogeneity. The second is information redundancy which easily incurs ambiguous data to blur class boundaries and impair model generalization. Therefore, we propose a novel expanded boundary by extending the original class boundary with fuzzy set theory, which adaptively adjusts the boundary to fit ambiguous data. By integrating the expanded boundary into the prototype-scale alignment module, our model further tightens the produced representations and reduces boundary ambiguity. Additionally, compared with the original class boundary, the expanded boundary preserves more margins for classifying unseen data, which guarantees the model generalization. Extensive experiment results across various real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model against existing state-of-the-art methods."
Poster,Enhancing Clustered Federated Learning: Integration of Strategies and Improved Methodologies,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27669,"Yongxin Guo, Xiaoying Tang, Tao Lin","Federated Learning (FL) is an evolving distributed machine learning approach that safeguards client privacy by keeping data on edge devices. However, the variation in data among clients poses challenges in training models that excel across all local distributions. Recent studies suggest clustering as a solution to address client heterogeneity in FL by grouping clients with distribution shifts into distinct clusters. Nonetheless, the diverse learning frameworks used in current clustered FL methods create difficulties in integrating these methods, leveraging their advantages, and making further enhancements.  To this end, this paper conducts a thorough examination of existing clustered FL methods and introduces a four-tier framework, named HCFL, to encompass and extend the existing approaches. Utilizing the HCFL, we identify persistent challenges associated with current clustering methods in each tier and propose an enhanced clustering method called HCFL$^{+}$ to overcome these challenges. Through extensive numerical evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our clustering framework and the enhanced components. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/LINs-lab/HCFL}."
Poster,Enhancing Cognition and Explainability of Multimodal Foundation Models with Self-Synthesized Data,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28527,"Yucheng Shi, Quanzheng Li, Jin Sun, Xiang Li, Ninghao Liu","Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), or Vision-Language Models (VLMs), have shown impressive capabilities in a wide range of visual tasks. However, they often struggle with fine-grained visual reasoning, failing to identify domain-specific objectives and provide justifiable explanations for their predictions. To address the above challenge, we propose a novel visual rejection sampling framework to improve the cognition and explainability of LMMs using self-synthesized data. Specifically, visual fine-tuning requires images, queries, and target answers. Our approach begins by synthesizing interpretable answers that include human-verifiable visual features. These features are based on expert-defined concepts, and carefully selected based on their alignment with the image content. After each round of fine-tuning, we apply a reward model-free filtering mechanism to select the highest-quality interpretable answers for the next round of tuning. This iterative process of synthetic data generation and fine-tuning progressively improves the model's ability to generate accurate and reasonable explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving both the accuracy and explainability of specialized visual classification tasks."
