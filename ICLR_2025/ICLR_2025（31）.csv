Poster,AutoDAN-Turbo: A Lifelong Agent for Strategy Self-Exploration to Jailbreak LLMs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29096,"Xiaogeng Liu, Peiran Li, G. Edward Suh, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik, Zhuoqing Mao, Somesh Jha, Patrick McDaniel, Huan Sun, Bo Li, Chaowei Xiao","Jailbreak attacks serve as essential red-teaming tools, proactively assessing whether LLMs can behave responsibly and safely in adversarial environments. Despite diverse strategies (e.g., cipher, low-resource language, persuasions, and so on) that have been proposed and shown success, these strategies are still manually designed, limiting their scope and effectiveness as a red-teaming tool. In this paper, we propose AutoDAN-Turbo, a black-box jailbreak method that can automatically discover as many jailbreak strategies as possible from scratch, without any human intervention or predefined scopes (e.g., specified candidate strategies), and use them for red-teaming. As a result, AutoDAN-Turbo can significantly outperform baseline methods, achieving a 74.3% higher average attack success rate on public benchmarks. Notably, AutoDAN-Turbo achieves an 88.5 attack success rate on GPT-4-1106-turbo. In addition, AutoDAN-Turbo is a unified framework that can incorporate existing human-designed jailbreak strategies in a plug-and-play manner. By integrating human-designed strategies, AutoDAN-Turbo can even achieve a higher attack success rate of 93.4 on GPT-4-1106-turbo."
Poster,Auto-GDA: Automatic Domain Adaptation for Efficient Grounding Verification in Retrieval-Augmented Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27875,"Tobias Leemann, Periklis Petridis, Giuseppe Vietri, Dionysis Manousakas, Aaron Roth, Sergul Aydore","While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been shown to enhance factuality of large language model (LLM) outputs, LLMs still suffer from hallucination, generating incorrect or irrelevant information. A common detection strategy involves prompting the LLM again to assess whether its response is grounded in the retrieved evidence, but this approach is costly. Alternatively, lightweight natural language inference (NLI) models for efficient grounding verification can be used at inference time. While existing pre-trained NLI models offer potential solutions, their performance remains subpar compared to larger models on realistic RAG inputs. RAG inputs are more complex than most datasets used for training NLI models and have characteristics specific to the underlying knowledge base, requiring adaptation of the NLI models to a specific target domain. Additionally, the lack of labeled instances in the target domain makes supervised domain adaptation, e.g., through fine-tuning, infeasible. To address these challenges, we introduce Automatic Generative Domain Adaptation (Auto-GDA). Our framework enables unsupervised domain adaptation through synthetic data generation.Unlike previous methods that rely on handcrafted filtering and augmentation strategies, Auto-GDA employs an iterative process to continuously improve the quality of generated samples using weak labels from less efficient teacher models and discrete optimization to select the most promising augmented samples. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with models fine-tuned on synthetic data using Auto-GDA often surpassing the performance of the teacher model and reaching the performance level of LLMs at 10% of their computational cost."
Poster,AutoG: Towards automatic graph construction from tabular data,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28741,"Zhikai Chen, Han Xie, Jian Zhang, Xiang song, Jiliang Tang, Huzefa Rangwala, George Karypis","Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in graph machine learning (GML), with its applications spanning numerous domains. However, the focus of GML has predominantly been on developing powerful models, often overlooking a crucial initial step: constructing suitable graphs from common data formats, such as tabular data.This construction process is fundamental to applying graph-based models, yet it remains largely understudied and lacks formalization.Our research aims to address this gap by formalizing the graph construction problem and proposing an effective solution. We identify two critical challenges to achieve this goal: 1. The absence of dedicated datasets to formalize and evaluate the effectiveness of graph construction methods, and 2. Existing automatic construction methods can only be applied to some specific cases, while tedious human engineering is required to generate high-quality graphs. To tackle these challenges, we present a two-fold contribution.First, we introduce a set of datasets to formalize and evaluate graph construction methods. Second, we propose an LLM-based solution, AutoG, automatically generating high-quality graph schemas without human intervention.The experimental results demonstrate that the quality of constructed graphs is critical to downstream task performance, and AutoG can generate high-quality graphs that rival those produced by human experts.

Poster,Automated Design of Agentic Systems,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28073,"Shengran Hu, Cong Lu, Jeff Clune","Researchers are investing substantial effort in developing powerful general-purpose agents, wherein Foundation Models are used as modules within agentic systems (e.g. Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, Toolformer). However, the history of machine learning teaches us that hand-designed solutions are eventually replaced by learned solutions. We describe a newly forming research area, Automated Design of Agentic Systems (ADAS), which aims to automatically create powerful agentic system designs, including inventing novel building blocks and/or combining them in new ways. We further demonstrate that there is an unexplored yet promising approach within ADAS where agents can be defined in code and new agents can be automatically discovered by a meta agent programming ever better ones in code. Given that programming languages are Turing Complete, this approach theoretically enables the learning of any possible agentic system: including novel prompts, tool use, workflows, and combinations thereof. We present a simple yet effective algorithm named Meta Agent Search to demonstrate this idea, where a meta agent iteratively programs interesting new agents based on an ever-growing archive of previous discoveries. Through extensive experiments across multiple domains including coding, science, and math, we show that our algorithm can progressively invent agents with novel designs that greatly outperform state-of-the-art hand-designed agents. Importantly, we consistently observe the surprising result that agents invented by Meta Agent Search maintain superior performance even when transferred across domains and models, demonstrating their robustness and generality. Provided we develop it safely, our work illustrates the potential of an exciting new research direction toward automatically designing ever-more powerful agentic systems to benefit humanity."
Poster,Automated Filtering of Human Feedback Data for Aligning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30748,"Yongjin Yang, Sihyeon Kim, Hojung Jung, Sangmin Bae, SangMook Kim, Se-Young Yun, Kimin Lee","Fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models with human feedback is an effective method for aligning model behavior with human intentions. However, this alignment process often suffers from slow convergence due to the large size and noise present in human feedback datasets. In this work, we propose FiFA, a novel automated data filtering algorithm designed to enhance the fine-tuning of diffusion models using human feedback datasets with direct preference optimization (DPO). Specifically, our approach selects data by solving an optimization problem to maximize three components: preference margin, text quality, and text diversity. The concept of preference margin is used to identify samples that are highly informative in addressing the noisy nature of feedback dataset, which is calculated using a proxy reward model. Additionally, we incorporate text quality, assessed by large language models to prevent harmful contents, and consider text diversity through a k-nearest neighbor entropy estimator to improve generalization. Finally, we integrate all these components into an optimization process, with approximating the solution by assigning importance score to each data pair and selecting the most important ones. As a result, our method efficiently filters data automatically, without the need for manual intervention, and can be applied to any large-scale dataset. Experimental results show that FiFA significantly enhances training stability and achieves better performance, being preferred by humans 17% more, while using less than 0.5% of the full data and thus 1% of the GPU hours compared to utilizing full human feedback datasets."
Poster,Automated Proof Generation for Rust Code via Self-Evolution,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31144,"Tianyu Chen, Shuai Lu, Shan Lu, Yeyun Gong, Chenyuan Yang, Xuheng Li, Md Rakib Hossain Misu, Hao Yu, Nan Duan, Peng CHENG, Fan Yang, Shuvendu Lahiri, Tao Xie, Lidong Zhou","Ensuring correctness is crucial for code generation. Formal verification offers adefinitive assurance of correctness, but demands substantial human effort in proofconstruction and hence raises a pressing need for automation. The primary obsta-cle lies in the severe lack of data—there is much fewer proofs than code snippetsfor Large Language Models (LLMs) to train upon. In this paper, we introduceSAFE, a framework that overcomes the lack of human-written proofs to enableautomated proof generation of Rust code. SAFE establishes a self-evolving cyclewhere data synthesis and fine-tuning collaborate to enhance the model capability,leveraging the definitive power of a symbolic verifier in telling correct proofs fromincorrect ones. SAFE also re-purposes the large number of synthesized incorrectproofs to train the self-debugging capability of the fine-tuned models, empoweringthem to fix incorrect proofs based on the verifier’s feedback. SAFE demonstratessuperior efficiency and precision compared to GPT-4o. Through tens of thousandsof synthesized proofs and the self-debugging mechanism, we improve the capa-bility of open-source models, initially unacquainted with formal verification, toautomatically write proofs for Rust code. This advancement leads to a signifi-cant improvement in performance, achieving a 52.52% accuracy rate in a bench-mark crafted by human experts, a significant leap over GPT-4o’s performance of14.39%."
Poster,Automatic Curriculum Expert Iteration for Reliable LLM Reasoning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31053,"Zirui Zhao, Hanze Dong, Amrita Saha, Caiming Xiong, Doyen Sahoo","Hallucinations (i.e., generating plausible but inaccurate content) and laziness (i.e. excessive refusals or defaulting to ""I don't know"") persist as major challenges in LLM reasoning. Current efforts to reduce hallucinations primarily focus on factual errors in knowledge-grounded tasks, often neglecting hallucinations related to faulty reasoning. Meanwhile, some approaches render LLMs overly conservative, limiting their problem-solving capabilities. To mitigate hallucination and laziness in reasoning tasks, we propose Automatic Curriculum Expert Iteration (Auto-CEI) to enhance LLM reasoning and align responses to the model’s capabilities--assertively answering within its limits and declining when tasks exceed them. In our method, Expert Iteration explores the reasoning trajectories near the LLM policy, guiding incorrect paths back on track to reduce compounding errors and improve robustness; it also promotes appropriate ""I don't know"" responses after sufficient reasoning attempts. The curriculum automatically adjusts rewards, incentivizing extended reasoning before acknowledging incapability, thereby pushing the limits of LLM reasoning and aligning its behaviour with these limits. We compare Auto-CEI with various SOTA baselines across logical reasoning, mathematics, and planning tasks, where Auto-CEI achieves superior alignment by effectively balancing assertiveness and conservativeness."
Poster,Autonomous Evaluation of LLMs for Truth Maintenance and Reasoning Tasks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28665,"Rushang Karia, Daniel Bramblett, Daksh Dobhal, Siddharth Srivastava","This paper presents AutoEval, a novel benchmark for scaling Large Language Model (LLM) assessment in formal tasks with clear notions of correctness, such as truth maintenance in translation and logical reasoning. AutoEval is the first benchmarking paradigm that offers several key advantages necessary for scaling objective evaluation of LLMs without human labeling: (a) ability to evaluate LLMs of increasing sophistication by auto-generating tasks at different levels of difficulty; (b) auto-generation of ground truth that eliminates dependence on expensive and time-consuming human annotation; (c) the use of automatically generated, randomized datasets that mitigate the ability of successive LLMs to overfit to static datasets used in many contemporary benchmarks. Empirical analysis shows that an LLM's performance on AutoEval is highly indicative of its performance on a diverse array of other benchmarks focusing on translation and reasoning tasks, making it a valuable autonomous evaluation paradigm in settings where hand-curated datasets can be hard to obtain and/or update."
Poster,Autoregressive Pretraining with Mamba in Vision,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29755,"Sucheng Ren, Xianhang Li, Haoqin Tu, Feng Wang, Fangxun Shu, Lei Zhang, Jieru Mei, Linjie Yang, Peng Wang, Heng Wang, Alan Yuille, Cihang Xie","The vision community has started to build with the recently developed state space model, Mamba, as the new backbone for a range of tasks. This paper shows that Mamba's visual capability can be significantly enhanced through autoregressive pretraining, a direction not previously explored. Efficiency-wise, the autoregressive nature can well capitalize on the Mamba's unidirectional recurrent structure, enabling faster overall training speed compared to other training strategies like mask modeling. Performance-wise, autoregressive pretraining equips the Mamba architecture with markedly higher accuracy over its supervised-trained counterparts and, more importantly, successfully unlocks its scaling potential to large and even huge model sizes. For example, with autoregressive pretraining, a base-size Mamba attains 83.2\% ImageNet accuracy, outperforming its supervised counterpart by 2.0\%; our huge-size Mamba, the largest Vision Mamba to date, attains 85.0\% ImageNet accuracy (85.5\% when finetuned with $384\times384$ inputs), notably surpassing all other Mamba variants in vision.

Poster,Autoregressive Video Generation without Vector Quantization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30117,"Haoge Deng, Ting Pan, Haiwen Diao, Zhengxiong Luo, Yufeng Cui, Huchuan Lu, Shiguang Shan, Yonggang Qi, Xinlong Wang","This paper presents a novel approach that enables autoregressive video generation with high efficiency. We propose to reformulate the video generation problem as a non-quantized autoregressive modeling of temporal frame-by-frame prediction and spatial set-by-set prediction. Unlike raster-scan prediction in prior autoregressive models or joint distribution modeling of fixed-length tokens in diffusion models, our approach maintains the causal property of GPT-style models for flexible in-context capabilities, while leveraging bidirectional modeling within individual frames for efficiency. With the proposed approach, we train a novel video autoregressive model without vector quantization, termed NOVA. Our results demonstrate that NOVA surpasses prior autoregressive video models in data efficiency, inference speed, visual fidelity, and video fluency, even with a much smaller model capacity, i.e., 0.6B parameters. NOVA also outperforms state-of-the-art image diffusion models in text-to-image generation tasks, with a significantly lower training cost. Additionally, NOVA generalizes well across extended video durations and enables diverse zero-shot applications in one unified model. Code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/baaivision/NOVA."
