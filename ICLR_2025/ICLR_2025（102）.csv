Poster,E(3)-equivariant models cannot learn chirality: Field-based molecular generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28460,"Alexandru Dumitrescu, Dani Korpela, Markus Heinonen, Yogesh Verma, Valerii Iakovlev, Vikas Garg, Harri Lähdesmäki","Obtaining the desired effect of drugs is highly dependent on their molecular geometries. Thus, the current prevailing paradigm focuses on 3D point-cloud atom representations, utilizing graph neural network (GNN) parametrizations, with rotational symmetries baked in via E(3) invariant layers. We prove that such models must necessarily disregard chirality, a geometric property of the molecules that cannot be superimposed on their mirror image by rotation and translation. Chirality plays a key role in determining drug safety and potency. To address this glaring issue, we introduce a novel field-based representation, proposing reference rotations that replace rotational symmetry constraints. The proposed model captures all molecular geometries including chirality, while still achieving highly competitive performance with E(3)-based methods across standard benchmarking metrics."
Poster,Eagle: Exploring The Design Space for Multimodal LLMs with Mixture of Encoders,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29276,"Min Shi, Fuxiao Liu, Shihao Wang, Shijia Liao, Subhashree Radhakrishnan, Yilin Zhao, De-An Huang, Hongxu Yin, Karan Sapra, Yaser Yacoob, Humphrey Shi, Bryan Catanzaro, Andrew Tao, Jan Kautz, Zhiding Yu, Guilin Liu","The ability to accurately interpret complex visual information is a crucial topic of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent work indicates that enhanced visual perception significantly reduces hallucinations and improves performance on resolution-sensitive tasks, such as optical character recognition and document analysis. A number of recent MLLMs achieve this goal using a mixture of vision encoders. Despite their success, there is a lack of systematic comparisons and detailed ablation studies addressing critical aspects, such as expert selection and the integration of multiple vision experts. This study provides an extensive exploration of the design space for MLLMs using a mixture of vision encoders and resolutions. Our findings reveal several underlying principles common to various existing strategies, leading to a streamlined yet effective design approach. We discover that simply concatenating visual tokens from a set of complementary vision encoders is as effective as more complex mixing architectures or strategies. We additionally introduce Pre-Alignment to bridge the gap between vision-focused encoders and language tokens, enhancing model coherence. The resulting family of MLLMs, Eagle, surpasses other leading open-source models on major MLLM benchmarks."
Poster,Earlier Tokens Contribute More: Learning Direct Preference Optimization From Temporal Decay Perspective,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29798,"Ruichen Shao, Bei Li, Gangao Liu, Yang Chen, Xiang Zhou, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai, Peng Li","Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained attention as an efficient alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Despite its advantages, DPO suffers from a length bias, generating responses longer than those from the reference model. Existing solutions like SimPO and SamPO address this issue but uniformly treat the contribution of rewards across sequences, overlooking temporal dynamics. To this end, we propose an enhanced preference optimization method that incorporates a temporal decay factor controlled by a gamma parameter. This dynamic weighting mechanism adjusts the influence of each reward based on its position in the sequence, prioritizing earlier tokens that are more critical for alignment. By adaptively focusing on more relevant feedback, our approach mitigates overfitting to less pertinent data and remains responsive to evolving human preferences. Experimental results on several benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms vanilla DPO by 5.9-8.8 points on AlpacaEval 2 and 3.3-9.7 points on Arena-Hard across different model architectures and sizes. Furthermore, additional experiments on mathematical and reasoning benchmarks (MMLU, GSM8K, and MATH) confirm that our method enhances performance without compromising general capabilities.

Poster,Easing Training Process of Rectified Flow Models Via Lengthening Inter-Path Distance,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29645,"Shifeng Xu, Yanzhu Liu, Adams Kong","Recent research pinpoints that different diffusion methods and architectures trained on the same dataset produce similar results for the same input noise. This property suggests that they have some preferable noises for a given sample. By visualizing the noise-sample pairs of rectified flow models and stable diffusion models in two-dimensional spaces, we observe that the preferable paths, connecting preferable noises to the corresponding samples, are better organized with significant fewer crossings comparing with the random paths, connecting random noises to training samples. In high-dimensional space, paths rarely intersect. The path crossings in two-dimensional spaces indicate the shorter inter-path distance in the corresponding high-dimensional spaces. Inspired by this observation, we propose the Distance-Aware Noise-Sample Matching (DANSM) method to lengthen the inter-path distance for speeding up the model training. DANSM is derived from rectified flow models, which allow using a closed-form formula to calculate the inter-path distance. To further simplify the optimization, we derive the relationship between inter-path distance and path length, and use the latter in the optimization surrogate. DANSM is evaluated on both image and latent spaces by rectified flow models and diffusion models. The experimental results show that DANSM can significantly improve the training speed by 30\% $\sim$ 40\%without sacrificing the generation quality."
Poster,ECD: A Machine Learning Benchmark for Predicting Enhanced-Precision Electronic Charge Density in Crystalline Inorganic Materials,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29623,"Pin Chen, Zexin Xu, Qing Mo, Hongjin Zhong, Fengyang Xu, Yutong Lu","Supervised machine learning techniques are increasingly being adopted to speed up electronic structure predictions, serving as alternatives to first-principles methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT). Although current DFT datasets mainly emphasize chemical properties and atomic forces, the precise prediction of electronic charge density is essential for accurately determining a system's total energy and ground state properties. In this study, we introduce a novel electronic charge density dataset named ECD, which encompasses 140,646 stable crystal geometries with medium-precision Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional data. Within this dataset, a subset of 7,147 geometries includes high-precision electronic charge density data calculated using the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) functional in DFT. By designing various benchmark tasks for crystalline materials and emphasizing training with large-scale PBE data while fine-tuning with a smaller subset of high-precision HSE data, we demonstrate the efficacy of current machine learning models in predicting electronic charge densities.The ECD dataset and baseline models are open-sourced to support community efforts in developing new methodologies and accelerating materials design and applications."
Poster,EC-Diffuser: Multi-Object Manipulation via Entity-Centric Behavior Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28379,"Carl Qi, Dan Haramati, Tal Daniel, Aviv Tamar, Amy Zhang","Object manipulation is a common component of everyday tasks, but learning to manipulate objects from high-dimensional observations presents significant challenges. These challenges are heightened in multi-object environments due to the combinatorial complexity of the state space as well as of the desired behaviors. While recent approaches have utilized large-scale offline data to train models from pixel observations, achieving performance gains through scaling, these methods struggle with compositional generalization in unseen object configurations with constrained network and dataset sizes. To address these issues, we propose a novel behavioral cloning (BC) approach that leverages object-centric representations and an entity-centric Transformer with diffusion-based optimization, enabling efficient learning from offline image data. Our method first decomposes observations into Deep Latent Particles (DLP), which are then processed by our entity-centric Transformer that computes attention at the particle level, simultaneously predicting object dynamics and the agent's actions. Combined with the ability of diffusion models to capture multi-modal behavior distributions, this results in substantial performance improvements in multi-object tasks and, more importantly, enables compositional generalization. We present BC agents capable of zero-shot generalization to perform tasks with novel compositions of objects and goals, including larger numbers of objects than seen during training. We provide video rollouts on our webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/ec-diffuser."
Poster,EC-DIT: Scaling Diffusion Transformers with Adaptive Expert-Choice Routing,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29721,"Haotian Sun, Tao Lei, Bowen Zhang, Yanghao Li, Haoshuo Huang, Ruoming Pang, Bo Dai, Nan Du","Diffusion transformers have been widely adopted for text-to-image synthesis. While scaling these models up to billions of parameters shows promise, the effectiveness of scaling beyond current sizes remains underexplored and challenging. By explicitly exploiting the computational heterogeneity of image generations, we develop a new family of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models (EC-DIT) for diffusion transformers with expert-choice routing. EC-DIT learns to adaptively optimize the compute allocated to understand the input texts and generate the respective image patches, enabling heterogeneous computation aligned with varying text-image complexities. This heterogeneity provides an efficient way of scaling EC-DIT up to 97 billion parameters and achieving significant improvements in training convergence, text-to-image alignment, and overall generation quality over dense models and conventional MoE models. Through extensive ablations, we show that EC-DIT demonstrates superior scalability and adaptive compute allocation by recognizing varying textual importance through end-to-end training. Notably, in text-to-image alignment evaluation, our largest models achieve a state-of-the-art GenEval score of 71.68% and still maintain competitive inference speed with intuitive interpretability."
Poster,ECHOPulse: ECG Controlled Echocardio-gram Video Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28723,"Yiwei Li, Sekeun Kim, Zihao Wu, Hanqi Jiang, Yi Pan, Pengfei Jin, Sifan Song, Yucheng Shi, Xiaowei Yu, Tianze Yang, Tianming Liu, Quanzheng Li, Xiang Li","Echocardiography (ECHO) is essential for cardiac assessments, but its video quality and interpretation heavily relies on manual expertise, leading to inconsistent results from clinical and portable devices. ECHO video generation offers a solution by improving automated monitoring through synthetic data and generating high-quality videos from routine health data. However, existing models often face high computational costs, slow inference, and rely on complex conditional prompts that require experts' annotations. To address these challenges, we propose ECHOPulse, an ECG-conditioned ECHO video generation model. ECHOPulse introduces two key advancements: (1) it accelerates ECHO video generation by leveraging VQ-VAE tokenization and masked visual token modeling for fast decoding, and (2) it conditions on readily accessible ECG signals, which are highly coherent with ECHO videos, bypassing complex conditional prompts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use time-series prompts like ECG signals for ECHO video generation. ECHOPulse not only enables controllable synthetic ECHO data generation but also provides updated cardiac function information for disease monitoring and prediction beyond ECG alone. Evaluations on three public and private datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in ECHO video generation across both qualitative and quantitative measures. Additionally, ECHOPulse can be easily generalized to other modality generation tasks, such as cardiac MRI, fMRI, and 3D CT generation. We will make the synthetic ECHO dataset, along with the code and model, publicly available upon acceptance."
Poster,EcoFace: Audio-Visual Emotional Co-Disentanglement Speech-Driven 3D Talking Face Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28709,"Jiajian Xie, Shengyu Zhang, Mengze Li, chengfei lv, Zhou Zhao, Fei Wu","Speech-driven 3D facial animation has attracted significant attention due to its wide range of applications in animation production and virtual reality. Recent research has explored speech-emotion disentanglement to enhance facial expressions rather than manually assigning emotions. However, this approach face issues such as feature confusion, emotions weakening and mean-face. To address these issues, we present EcoFace, a framework that (1) proposes a novel collaboration objective to provide a explicit signal for emotion representation learning from the speaker's expressive movements and produced sounds, constructing an audio-visual joint and coordinated emotion space that is independent of speech content. (2) constructs a universal facial motion distribution space determined by speech features and implement speaker-specific generation. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves more generalized and emotionally realistic talking face generation compared to previous methods."
Poster,econSG: Efficient and Multi-view Consistent Open-Vocabulary 3D Semantic Gaussians,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28248,"Can Zhang, Gim H Lee","The primary focus of most recent works on open-vocabulary neural fields is extracting precise semantic featuresfrom the VLMs and then consolidating them efficiently into a multi-view consistent 3D neural fieldsrepresentation. However, most existing works over-trusted SAM to regularize image-level CLIP without any further refinement. Moreover, several existing works improved efficiency by dimensionality reduction of semantic features from 2D VLMs before fusing with 3DGS semantic fields, which inevitably leads to multi-view inconsistency. In this work, we propose econSG for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with 3DGS. Our econSG consists of: 1) A Confidence-region Guided Regularization (CRR) that mutually refines SAM and CLIP to get the best of both worlds for precise semantic features with complete and precise boundaries. 2) A low dimensional contextual space to enforce 3D multi-view consistency while improving computational efficiency by fusing backprojected multi-view 2D features and follow by dimensional reduction directly on the fused 3D features instead of operating on each 2D view separately. Our econSG show state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets compared to the existing methods. Furthermore, we are also the most efficient training among all the methods."
