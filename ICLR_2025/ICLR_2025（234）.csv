Poster,Neural Spacetimes for DAG Representation Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28100,"Haitz Sáez de Ocáriz Borde, Anastasis Kratsios, Marc T Law, Xiaowen Dong, Michael Bronstein","We propose a class of trainable deep learning-based geometries called Neural SpaceTimes (NSTs), which can universally represent nodes in weighted Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) as events in a spacetime manifold. While most works in the literature focus on undirected graph representation learning or causality embedding separately, our differentiable geometry can encode both graph edge weights in its spatial dimensions and causality in the form of edge directionality in its temporal dimensions. We use a product manifold that combines a quasi-metric (for space) and a partial order (for time). NSTs are implemented as three neural networks trained in an end-to-end manner: an embedding network, which learns to optimize the location of nodes as events in the spacetime manifold, and two other networks that optimize the space and time geometries in parallel, which we call a neural (quasi-)metric and a neural partial order, respectively. The latter two networks leverage recent ideas at the intersection of fractal geometry and deep learning to shape the geometry of the representation space in a data-driven fashion, unlike other works in the literature that use fixed spacetime manifolds such as Minkowski space or De Sitter space to embed DAGs. Our main theoretical guarantee is a universal embedding theorem, showing that any $k$-point DAG can be embedded into an NST with $1+\mathcal{O}(\log(k))$ distortion while exactly preserving its causal structure. The total number of parameters defining the NST is sub-cubic in $k$ and linear in the width of the DAG. If the DAG has a planar Hasse diagram, this is improved to $\mathcal{O}(\log(k) + 2)$ spatial and 2 temporal dimensions. We validate our framework computationally with synthetic weighted DAGs and real-world network embeddings; in both cases, the NSTs achieve lower embedding distortions than their counterparts using fixed spacetime geometries."
Poster,Neural Stochastic Differential Equations for Uncertainty-Aware Offline RL,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28729,"Cevahir Koprulu, Franck Djeumou, ufuk topcu","Offline model-based reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled approach to using a learned dynamics model as a simulator to optimize a control policy. Despite the near-optimal performance of existing approaches on benchmarks with high-quality datasets, most struggle on datasets with low state-action space coverage or suboptimal demonstrations.We develop a novel offline model-based RL approach that particularly shines in low-quality data regimes while maintaining competitive performance on high-quality datasets.Neural Stochastic Differential Equations for Uncertainty-aware, Offline RL (NUNO) learns a dynamics model as neural stochastic differential equations (SDE), where its drift term can leverage prior physics knowledge as inductive bias.In parallel, its diffusion term provides distance-aware estimates of model uncertainty by matching the dynamics' underlying stochasticity near the training data regime while providing high but bounded estimates beyond it.To address the so-called model exploitation problem in offline model-based RL, NUNO builds on existing studies by penalizing and adaptively truncating neural SDE's rollouts according to uncertainty estimates.Our empirical results in D4RL and NeoRL MuJoCo benchmarks evidence that NUNO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in low-quality datasets by up to 93% while matching or surpassing their performance by up to 55% in some high-quality counterparts."
Poster,Neural Wave Equation for Irregularly Sampled Sequence Data,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28570,"Arkaprava Majumdar, M Anand Krishna, P. K. Srijith","Sequence labeling problems arise in several real-world applications such as healthcare and robotics. In many such applications, sequence data are irregularly sampled and are of varying complexities. Recently, efforts have been made to develop neural ODE-based architectures to model the evolution of hidden states continuously in time, to address irregularly sampled sequence data. However, they assume a fixed architectural depth and limit their flexibility to adapt to data sets with varying complexities. We propose the neural wave equation, a novel deep learning method inspired by the wave equation, to address this through continuous modeling of depth. Neural Wave Equation models the evolution of hidden states continuously across time as well as depth by using a non-homogeneous wave equation parameterized by a neural network.  Through d'Alembert's analytical solution of the wave equation, we also show that the neural wave equation provides denser connections across the hidden states, allowing for better modeling capability.  We conduct experiments on several sequence labeling problems involving irregularly sampled sequence data and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed neural wave equation model."
Poster,NeurFlow: Interpreting Neural Networks through Neuron Groups and Functional Interactions,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30270,"Tue Cao, Nhat Hoang-Xuan, Hieu Pham, Phi Le Nguyen, My Thai","Understanding the inner workings of neural networks is essential for enhancing model performance and interpretability. Current research predominantly focuses on examining the connection between individual neurons and the model's final predictions, which suffers from challenges in interpreting the internal workings of the model, particularly when neurons encode multiple unrelated features. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that transitions the focus from analyzing individual neurons to investigating groups of neurons, shifting the emphasis from neuron-output relationships to the functional interactions between neurons. Our automated framework, NeurFlow, first identifies core neurons and clusters them into groups based on shared functional relationships, enabling a more coherent and interpretable view of the network’s internal processes. This approach facilitates the construction of a hierarchical circuit representing neuron interactions across layers, thus improving interpretability while reducing computational costs. Our extensive empirical studies validate the fidelity of our proposed NeurFlow. Additionally, we showcase its utility in practical applications such as image debugging and automatic concept labeling, thereby highlighting its potential to advance the field of neural network explainability."
Poster,NeuroLM: A Universal Multi-task Foundation Model for Bridging the Gap between Language and EEG Signals,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30149,"Wei-Bang Jiang, Yansen Wang, Bao-liang Lu, Dongsheng Li","Recent advancements for large-scale pre-training with neural signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) have shown promising results, significantly boosting the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and healthcare. However, these pre-trained models often require full fine-tuning on each downstream task to achieve substantial improvements, limiting their versatility and usability, and leading to considerable resource wastage. To tackle these challenges, we propose NeuroLM, the first multi-task foundation model that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by regarding EEG signals as a foreign language, endowing the model with multi-task learning and inference capabilities. Our approach begins with learning a text-aligned neural tokenizer through vector-quantized temporal-frequency prediction, which encodes EEG signals into discrete neural tokens. These EEG tokens, generated by the frozen vector-quantized (VQ) encoder, are then fed into an LLM that learns causal EEG information via multi-channel autoregression. Consequently, NeuroLM can understand both EEG and language modalities. Finally, multi-task instruction tuning adapts NeuroLM to various downstream tasks. We are the first to demonstrate that, by specific incorporation with LLMs, NeuroLM unifies diverse EEG tasks within a single model through instruction tuning. The largest variant NeuroLM-XL has record-breaking 1.7B parameters for EEG signal processing, and is pre-trained on a large-scale corpus comprising approximately 25,000-hour EEG data. When evaluated on six diverse downstream datasets, NeuroLM showcases the huge potential of this multi-task learning paradigm."
Poster,Neuron-based Multifractal Analysis of Neuron Interaction Dynamics in Large Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28389,"Xiongye Xiao, Heng Ping, Chenyu Zhou, Defu Cao, Yaxing Li, Yi-Zhuo Zhou, Shixuan Li, Nikos Kanakaris, Paul Bogdan","In recent years, there has been increasing attention on the capabilities of large-scale models, particularly in handling complex tasks that small-scale models are unable to perform. Notably, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated ``intelligent'' abilities such as complex reasoning and abstract language comprehension, reflecting cognitive-like behaviors. However, current research on emergent abilities in large models predominantly focuses on the relationship between model performance and size, leaving a significant gap in the systematic quantitative analysis of the internal structures and mechanisms driving these emergent abilities. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience research on brain network structure and self-organization, we propose (i) a general network representation of large models, (ii) a new analytical framework — *Neuron-based Multifractal Analysis (NeuroMFA)* - for structural analysis, and (iii) a novel structure-based metric as a proxy for emergent abilities of large models. By linking structural features to the capabilities of large models, *NeuroMFA* provides a quantitative framework for analyzing emergent phenomena in large models. Our experiments show that the proposed method yields a comprehensive measure of the network's evolving heterogeneity and organization, offering theoretical foundations and a new perspective for investigating emergence in large models."
Poster,Neuron based Personality Trait Induction in Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29990,"Jia Deng, Tianyi Tang, Yanbin Yin, Wenhao yang, Xin Zhao, Ji-Rong Wen","Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly proficient at simulating various personality traits, an important capability for supporting related applications (e.g., role-playing). To further improve this capacity, in this paper, we present a neuron based approach for personality trait induction in LLMs, with three major technical contributions. First, we construct PERSONALITYBENCH, a large-scale dataset for identifying and evaluating personality traits in LLMs. This dataset is grounded in the Big Five personality traits from psychology and designed to assess the generative capabilities of LLMs towards specific personality traits. Second, by leveraging PERSONALITYBENCH, we propose an efficient method for identifying personality-related neurons within LLMs by examining the opposite aspects of a given trait. Third, we develop a simple yet effective induction method that manipulates the values of these identified personality-related neurons, which enables fine-grained control over the traits exhibited by LLMs without training and modifying model parameters. Extensive experiments validates the efficacy of our neuron identification and trait induction methods. Notably, our approach achieves comparable performance as fine-tuned models, offering a more efficient and flexible solution for personality trait induction in LLMs."
Poster,Neuron Platonic Intrinsic Representation From Dynamics Using Contrastive Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27925,"Wei Wu, Can Liao, Zizhen Deng, Zhengrui Guo, Jinzhuo Wang","The Platonic Representation Hypothesis posits that behind different modalities of data (what we sense or detect), there exists a universal, modality-independent representation of reality. Inspired by this, we treat each neuron as a system, where we can detect the neuron’s multi-segment activity data under different peripheral conditions. We believe that, similar to the Platonic idea, there exists a time-invariant representation behind the different segments of the same neuron, which reflects the intrinsic properties of the neuron’s system. Intrinsic properties include the molecular profiles, brain regions and morphological structure, etc. The optimization objective for obtaining the intrinsic representation of neurons should satisfy two criteria: (I) segments from the same neuron should have a higher similarity than segments from different neurons; (II) the representations should generalize well to out-of-domain data. To achieve this, we employ contrastive learning, treating different segments from the same neuron as positive pairs and segments from different neurons as negative pairs. During the implementation, we chose the VICReg, which uses only positive pairs for optimization but indirectly separates dissimilar samples via regularization terms. To validate the efficacy of our method, we first applied it to simulated neuron population dynamics data generated using the Izhikevich model. We successfully confirmed that our approach captures the type of each neuron as defined by preset hyperparameters. We then applied our method to two real-world neuron dynamics datasets, including spatial transcriptomics-derived neuron type annotations and the brain regions where each neuron is located. The learned representations from our model not only predict neuron type and location but also show robustness when tested on out-of-domain data (unseen animals). This demonstrates the potential of our approach in advancing the understanding of neuronal systems and offers valuable insights for future neuroscience research."
Poster,Neuroplastic Expansion in Deep Reinforcement Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31169,"Jiashun Liu, Johan S Obando Ceron, Aaron Courville, Ling Pan","The loss of plasticity in learning agents, analogous to the solidification of neural pathways in biological brains, significantly impedes learning and adaptation in reinforcement learning due to its non-stationary nature. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel approach, *Neuroplastic Expansion* (NE), inspired by cortical expansion in cognitive science. NE maintains learnability and adaptability throughout the entire training process by dynamically growing the network from a smaller initial size to its full dimension. Our method is designed with three key components: (1) elastic neuron generation based on potential gradients, (2) dormant neuron pruning to optimize network expressivity, and (3) neuron consolidation via experience review to strike a balance in the plasticity-stability dilemma. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NE effectively mitigates plasticity loss and outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various tasks in MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite environments. NE enables more adaptive learning in complex, dynamic environments, which represents a crucial step towards transitioning deep reinforcement learning from static, one-time training paradigms to more flexible, continually adapting models."
Poster,New Algorithms for the Learning-Augmented k-means Problem,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29284,"Junyu Huang, Qilong Feng, Ziyun Huang, Zhen Zhang, Jinhui Xu, Jianxin Wang","In this paper, we study the clustering problems in the learning-augmented setting, where predicted labels for a d-dimensional dataset with size m are given by an oracle to serve as auxiliary information to improve the clustering performance. Following the prior work, the given oracle is parameterized by some error rate α, which captures the accuracy of the oracle such that there are at most α fraction of false positives and false negatives in each predicted cluster. In this setting, the goal is to design fast and practical algorithms that can break the computational barriers of inapproximability. The current state-of-the-art learning-augmented k-means algorithm relies on sorting strategies to find good coordinates approximation, where a (1+O(α))-approximation can be achieved with near-linear running time in the data size. However, the computational demands for sorting may limit the scalability of the algorithm for handling large-scale datasets. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose new algorithms that can identify good coordinates approximation using sampling-based strategies, where (1+O(α))-approximation can be achieved with linear running time in the data size. To obtain a more practical algorithm for the problem with better clustering quality and running time, we propose a sampling-based heuristic which can directly find center approximations using sampling-based strategies. Empirical experiments show that our proposed methods are faster than the state-of-the-art learning-augmented k-means algorithms with comparable performances on clustering quality."
