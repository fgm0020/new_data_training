Poster,Three-in-One: Fast and Accurate Transducer for Hybrid-Autoregressive ASR,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29973,"Hainan Xu, Travis Bartley, Vladimir Bataev, Boris Ginsburg","We present Hybrid-Autoregressive INference TrANsducers (HAINAN), a novel architecture for speech recognition that extends the Token-and-Duration Transducer (TDT) model. Trained with randomly masked predictor network outputs, HAINAN supports both autoregressive inference with all network components and non-autoregressive inference without the predictor. Additionally, we propose a novel semi-autoregressive inference method that first generates an initial hypothesis using non-autoregressive inference, followed by refinement steps where each token prediction is regenerated using parallelized autoregression on the initial hypothesis. Experiments on multiple datasets across different languages demonstrate that HAINAN achieves efficiency parity with CTC in non-autoregressive mode and with TDT in autoregressive mode. In terms of accuracy, autoregressive HAINAN achieves parity with TDT and RNN-T, while non-autoregressive HAINAN significantly outperforms CTC. Semi-autoregressive inference further enhances the model's accuracy with minimal computational overhead, and even outperforms TDT results in some cases. These results highlight HAINAN's flexibility in balancing accuracy and speed, positioning it as a strong candidate for real-world speech recognition applications."
Poster,Three Mechanisms of Feature Learning in a Linear Network,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29349,"Yizhou Xu, Liu Ziyin","Understanding the dynamics of neural networks in different width regimes is crucial for improving their training and performance. We present an exact solution for the learning dynamics of a one-hidden-layer linear network, with one-dimensional data, across any finite width, uniquely exhibiting both kernel and feature learning phases. This study marks a technical advancement by enabling the analysis of the training trajectory from any initialization and a detailed phase diagram under varying common hyperparameters such as width, layer-wise learning rates, and scales of output and initialization. We identify three novel prototype mechanisms specific to the feature learning regime: (1) learning by alignment, (2) learning by disalignment, and (3) learning by rescaling, which contrast starkly with the dynamics observed in the kernel regime. Our theoretical findings are substantiated with empirical evidence showing that these mechanisms also manifest in deep nonlinear networks handling real-world tasks, enhancing our understanding of neural network training dynamics and guiding the design of more effective learning strategies."
Poster,"ThunderKittens: Simple, Fast, and $\textit{Adorable}$ Kernels",https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31243,"Benjamin Spector, Simran Arora, Aaryan Singhal, Arjun Parthasarathy, Dan Fu, Christopher Re","The challenge of mapping AI architectures to GPU hardware is creating a critical bottleneck in AI progress. Despite substantial efforts, hand-written custom kernels fail to meet their theoretical performance thresholds, even on well-established operations like linear attention. The diverse capabilities of GPUs suggests we might we need a wide variety of techniques to achieve high performance. However, our work explores if a small number of key abstractions can drastically simplify the process. We present ThunderKittens (TK), a framework for writing performant AI kernels while remaining easy to use. Our abstractions map to the three levels of the GPU hierarchy: (1) at the warp-level, we provide 16x16 matrix tiles as basic data structures and PyTorch-like operations, (2) at the thread-block level, we provide templates for asynchronously overlapping operations, and (3) at the grid-level, TK helps hide block launch, tear-down, and memory costs. We show the value of TK by providing simple & diverse kernels that match or outperform prior art. We match CuBLAS and FlashAttention-3 on GEMM and attention inference performance and outperform the strongest baselines by $10-40$\% on attention backwards, $8\times$ on state space models, and $14\times$ on linear attention."
Poster,TidalDecode: Fast and Accurate LLM Decoding with Position Persistent Sparse Attention,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30389,"Lijie Yang, Zhihao Zhang, Zhuofu Chen, Zikun Li, Zhihao Jia","Large language models (LLMs) have driven significant advancements across diverse NLP tasks, with long-context models gaining prominence for handling extended inputs. However, the expanding key-value (KV) cache size required by Transformer architectures intensifies the memory constraints, particularly during the decoding phase, creating a significant bottleneck. Existing sparse attention mechanisms designed to address this bottleneck have two limitations: (1) they often fail to reliably identify the most relevant tokens for attention, and (2) they overlook the spatial coherence of token selection across consecutive Transformer layers, which can lead to performance degradation and substantial overhead in token selection. This paper introduces TidalDecode, a simple yet effective algorithm and system for fast and accurate LLM decoding through position persistent sparse attention. TidalDecode leverages the spatial coherence of tokens selected by existing sparse attention methods and introduces a few token selection layers that perform full attention to identify the tokens with the highest attention scores, while all other layers perform sparse attention with the pre-selected tokens. This design enables TidalDecode to substantially reduce the overhead of token selection for sparse attention without sacrificing the quality of the generated results. Evaluation on a diverse set of LLMs and tasks shows that TidalDecode closely matches the generative performance of full attention methods while reducing the LLM decoding latency by up to $2.1\times$."
Poster,TIGER: Time-frequency Interleaved Gain Extraction and Reconstruction for Efficient Speech Separation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28155,"Mohan Xu, Kai Li, Guo Chen, Xiaolin Hu","In recent years, much speech separation research has focused primarily on improving model performance. However, for low-latency speech processing systems, high efficiency is equally important. Therefore, we propose a speech separation model with significantly reduced parameters and computational costs: Time-frequency Interleaved Gain Extraction and Reconstruction network (TIGER). TIGER leverages prior knowledge to divide frequency bands and compresses frequency information. We employ a multi-scale selective attention module to extract contextual features, while introducing a full-frequency-frame attention module to capture both temporal and frequency contextual information. Additionally, to more realistically evaluate the performance of speech separation models in complex acoustic environments, we introduce a dataset called EchoSet. This dataset includes noise and more realistic reverberation (e.g., considering object occlusions and material properties), with speech from two speakers overlapping at random proportions. Experimental results showed that models trained on EchoSet had better generalization ability than those trained on other datasets to the data collected in the physical world, which validated the practical value of the EchoSet. On EchoSet and real-world data, TIGER significantly reduces the number of parameters by 94.3% and the MACs by 95.3% while achieving performance surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) model TF-GridNet."
Poster,TIGeR: Unifying Text-to-Image Generation and Retrieval with Large Multimodal Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28444,"Leigang Qu, Haochuan Li, Tan Wang, Wenjie Wang, Yongqi Li, Liqiang Nie, Tat-Seng Chua","How humans can effectively and efficiently acquire images has always been a perennial question. A classic solution is *text-to-image retrieval* from an existing database; however, the limited database typically lacks creativity. By contrast, recent breakthroughs in *text-to-image generation* have made it possible to produce attractive and counterfactual visual content, but it faces challenges in synthesizing knowledge-intensive images. In this work, we rethink the relationship between text-to-image generation and retrieval, proposing a *unified* framework for both tasks with one single Large Multimodal Model (LMM). Specifically, we first explore the intrinsic discriminative abilities of LMMs and introduce an efficient generative retrieval method for text-to-image retrieval in a training-free manner. Subsequently, we unify generation and retrieval autoregressively and propose an autonomous decision mechanism to choose the best-matched one between generated and retrieved images as the response to the text prompt. To standardize the evaluation of unified text-to-image generation and retrieval, we construct TIGeR-Bench, a benchmark spanning both creative and knowledge-intensive domains. Extensive experiments on TIGeR-Bench and two retrieval benchmarks, *i.e.*, Flickr30K and MS-COCO, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework."
Poster,Tight Clusters Make Specialized Experts,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29725,"Stefan Nielsen, Rachel Teo, Laziz Abdullaev, Tan Nguyen","Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising approach to decoupling model capacity from computational cost. At the core of the MoE model is the router, which learns the underlying clustering structure of the input distribution in order to send input tokens to appropriate experts. However, latent clusters may be unidentifiable in high dimension, which causes slow convergence, susceptibility to data contamination, and overall degraded representations as the router is unable to perform appropriate token-expert matching. We examine the router through the lens of clustering optimization and derive optimal feature weights that maximally identify the latent clusters. We use these weights to compute the token-expert routing assignments in an adaptively transformed space that promotes well-separated clusters, which helps identify the best-matched expert for each token. In particular, for each expert cluster, we compute a set of weights that scales features according to whether that expert clusters tightly along that feature. We term this novel router the Adaptive Clustering (AC) router. Our AC router enables the MoE model to obtain three connected benefits: 1) faster convergence, 2) better robustness to data corruption, and 3) overall performance improvement, as experts are specialized in semantically distinct regions of the input space. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of our AC router over baseline routing methods when applied on a variety of MoE backbones for language modeling and image recognition tasks in both clean and corrupted settings."
Poster,Tighter Privacy Auditing of DP-SGD in the Hidden State Threat Model,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27756,"Tudor Cebere, Aurélien Bellet, Nicolas Papernot","Machine learning models can be trained with formal privacy guarantees via differentially private optimizers such as DP-SGD. In this work, we focus on a threat model where the adversary has access only to the final model, with no visibility into intermediate updates. In the literature, this ``hidden state'' threat model exhibits a significant gap between the lower bound from empirical privacy auditing and the theoretical upper bound provided by privacy accounting. To challenge this gap, we propose to audit this threat model with adversaries that craft a gradient sequence designed to maximize the privacy loss of the final model without relying on intermediate updates. Our experiments show that this approach consistently outperforms previous attempts at auditing the hidden state model. Furthermore, our results advance the understanding of achievable privacy guarantees within this threat model. Specifically, when the crafted gradient is inserted at every optimization step, we show that concealing the intermediate model updates in DP-SGD does not enhance the privacy guarantees. The situation is more complex when the crafted gradient is not inserted at every step: our auditing lower bound matches the privacy upper bound only for an adversarially-chosen loss landscape and a sufficiently large batch size. This suggests that existing privacy upper bounds can be improved in certain regimes."
Poster,Tight Lower Bounds under Asymmetric High-Order Hölder Smoothness and Uniform Convexity,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28882,"Cedar Site Bai, Brian Bullins","In this paper, we provide tight lower bounds for the oracle complexity of minimizing high-order Hölder smooth and uniformly convex functions. Specifically, for a function whose $p^{th}$-order derivatives are Hölder continuous with degree $\nu$ and parameter $H$, and that is uniformly convex with degree $q$ and parameter $\sigma$, we focus on two asymmetric cases: (1) $q > p + \nu$, and (2) $q < p+\nu$. Given up to $p^{th}$-order oracle access, we establish worst-case oracle complexities of $\Omega\left( \left( \frac{H}{\sigma}\right)^\frac{2}{3(p+\nu)-2}\left( \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}\right)^\frac{2(q-p-\nu)}{q(3(p+\nu)-2)}\right)$ in the first case with an $\ell_\infty$-ball-truncated-Gaussian smoothed hard function and $\Omega\left(\left(\frac{H}{\sigma}\right)^\frac{2}{3(p+\nu)-2}+ \log\log\left(\left(\frac{\sigma^{p+\nu}}{H^q}\right)^\frac{1}{p+\nu-q}\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$ in the second case, for reaching an $\epsilon$-approximate solution in terms of the optimality gap. Our analysis generalizes previous lower bounds for functions under first- and second-order smoothness as well as those for uniformly convex functions, and furthermore our results match the corresponding upper bounds in this general setting."
Poster,Tight Time Complexities in Parallel Stochastic Optimization with Arbitrary Computation Dynamics,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29045,Alexander Tyurin,"In distributed stochastic optimization, where parallel and asynchronous methods are employed, we establish optimal time complexities under virtually any computation behavior of workers/devices/CPUs/GPUs, capturing potential disconnections due to hardware and network delays, time-varying computation powers, and any possible fluctuations and trends of computation speeds. These real-world scenarios are formalized by our new universal computation model. Leveraging this model and new proof techniques, we discover tight lower bounds that apply to virtually all synchronous and asynchronous methods, including Minibatch SGD, Asynchronous SGD (Recht et al., 2011), and Picky SGD (Cohen et al., 2021). We show that these lower bounds, up to constant factors, are matched by the optimal Rennala SGD and Malenia SGD methods (Tyurin & Richtárik, 2023)."
