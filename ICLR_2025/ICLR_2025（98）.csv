Poster,Dream to Manipulate: Compositional World Models Empowering Robot Imitation Learning with Imagination,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31075,"Leonardo Barcellona, Andrii Zadaianchuk, Davide Allegro, Samuele Papa, Stefano Ghidoni, Efstratios Gavves","A world model provides an agent with a representation of its environment, enabling it to predict the causal consequences of its actions. Current world models typically cannot directly and explicitly imitate the actual environment in front of a robot, often resulting in unrealistic behaviors and hallucinations that make them unsuitable for real-world robotics applications. To overcome those challenges, we propose to rethink robot world models as learnable digital twins. We introduce DreMa, a new approach for constructing digital twins automatically using learned explicit representations of the real world and its dynamics, bridging the gap between traditional digital twins and world models.DreMa replicates the observed world and its structure by integrating Gaussian Splatting and physics simulators, allowing robots to imagine novel configurations of objects and to predict the future consequences of robot actions thanks to its compositionality.We leverage this capability to generate new data for imitation learning by applying equivariant transformations to a small set of demonstrations. Our evaluations across various settings demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and robustness by incrementing actions and object distributions, reducing the data needed to learn a policy and improving the generalization of the agents. As a highlight, we show that a real Franka Emika Panda robot, powered by DreMa’s imagination, can successfully learn novel physical tasks from just a single example per task variation (one-shot policy learning).Our project page can be found in: https://dreamtomanipulate.github.io/."
Poster,Dreamweaver: Learning Compositional World Models from Pixels,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28949,"Junyeob Baek, Yi-Fu Wu, Gautam Singh, Sungjin Ahn","Humans have an innate ability to decompose their perceptions of the world into objects and their attributes, such as colors, shapes, and movement patterns. This cognitive process enables us to imagine novel futures by recombining familiar concepts. However, replicating this ability in artificial intelligence systems has proven challenging, particularly when it comes to modeling videos into compositional concepts and generating unseen, recomposed futures without relying on auxiliary data, such as text, masks, or bounding boxes. In this paper, we propose __Dreamweaver__, a neural architecture designed to discover hierarchical and compositional representations from raw videos and generate compositional future simulations. Our approach leverages a novel Recurrent Block-Slot Unit (RBSU) to decompose videos into their constituent objects and attributes. In addition, Dreamweaver uses a multi-future-frame prediction objective to capture disentangled representations for dynamic concepts more effectively as well as static concepts. In experiments, we demonstrate our model outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines for world modeling when evaluated under the DCI framework across multiple datasets. Furthermore, we show how the modularized concept representations of our model enable compositional imagination, allowing the generation of novel videos by recombining attributes from previously seen objects.

Poster,DRESSing Up LLM: Efficient Stylized Question-Answering via Style Subspace Editing,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28469,"Xinyu Ma, Yifeng Xu, Yang Lin, Tianlong Wang, Xu Chu, Xin Gao, Junfeng Zhao, Yasha Wang","We introduce DRESS, a novel approach for generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses through representation editing. Existing methods like prompting and fine-tuning are either insufficient for complex style adaptation or computationally expensive, particularly in tasks like NPC creation or character role-playing. Our approach leverages the over-parameterized nature of LLMs to disentangle a style-relevant subspace within the model's representation space to conduct representation editing, ensuring a minimal impact on the original semantics. By applying adaptive editing strengths, we dynamically adjust the steering vectors in the style subspace to maintain both stylistic fidelity and semantic integrity. We develop two stylized QA benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of DRESS, and the results demonstrate significant improvements compared to baseline methods such as prompting and ITI. In short, DRESS is a lightweight, train-free solution for enhancing LLMs with flexible and effective style control, making it particularly useful for developing stylized conversational agents. Codes and benchmark datasets are available at https://github.com/ArthurLeoM/DRESS-LLM."
Poster,DriveTransformer: Unified Transformer for Scalable End-to-End Autonomous Driving,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29956,"Xiaosong Jia, Junqi You, Zhiyuan Zhang, Junchi Yan","End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a trend in the field of autonomous driving, promising a data-driven, scalable approach to system design. However, existing E2E-AD methods usually adopt the sequential paradigm of perception-prediction-planning, which leads to cumulative errors and training instability. The manual ordering of tasks also limits the system’s ability to leverage synergies between tasks (for example, planning-aware perception and game-theoretic interactive prediction and planning). Moreover, the dense BEV representation adopted by existing methods brings computational challenges for long-range perception and long-term temporal fusion.  To address these challenges, we present DriveTransformer, a simplified E2E-AD framework for the ease of scaling up, characterized  by three key features: Task Parallelism (All agent, map, and planning queries direct interact with each other at each block), Sparse Representation (Task queries direct interact with raw sensor features), and Streaming Processing (Task queries are stored and passed as history information). As a result, the new framework is composed of three unified operations: task self-attention, sensor cross-attention, temporal cross-attention, which significantly reduces the complexity of system and leads to better training stability. DriveTransformer achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulated closed-loop benchmark Bench2Drive and real world open-loop benchmark nuScenes with high FPS."
Poster,DRL: Decomposed Representation Learning for Tabular Anomaly Detection,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30521,"Hangting Ye, He Zhao, Wei Fan, Mingyuan Zhou, Dandan Guo, Yi Chang","Anomaly detection, indicating to identify the anomalies that significantly deviate from the majority normal instances of data, has been an important role in machine learning and related applications. Despite the significant success achieved in anomaly detection on image and text data, the accurate Tabular Anomaly Detection (TAD) has still been hindered due to the lack of clear prior semantic information in the tabular data. Most state-of-the-art TAD studies are along the line of reconstruction, which first reconstruct training data and then use reconstruction errors to decide anomalies; however, reconstruction on training data can still hardly distinguish anomalies due to the data entanglement in their representations. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel approach Decomposed Representation Learning (DRL), to re-map data into a tailor-designed constrained space, in order to capture the underlying shared patterns of normal samples and differ anomalous patterns for TAD.Specifically, we enforce the representation of each normal sample in the latent space to be decomposed into a weighted linear combination of randomly generated orthogonal basis vectors, where these basis vectors are both data-free and training-free.Furthermore, we enhance the discriminative capability between normal and anomalous patterns in the latent space by introducing a novel constraint that amplifies the discrepancy between these two categories, supported by theoretical analysis. Finally, extensive experiments on 40 tabular datasets and 16 competing tabular anomaly detection algorithms show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance."
Poster,DRoC: Elevating Large Language Models for Complex Vehicle Routing via Decomposed Retrieval of Constraints,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28142,"Xia Jiang, Yaoxin Wu, Chenhao Zhang, Yingqian Zhang","This paper proposes Decomposed Retrieval of Constraints (DRoC), a novel framework aimed at enhancing large language models (LLMs) in exploiting solvers to tackle vehicle routing problems (VRPs) with intricate constraints. While LLMs have shown promise in solving simple VRPs, their potential in addressing complex VRP variants is still suppressed, due to the limited embedded internal knowledge that is required to accurately reflect diverse VRP constraints. Our approach mitigates the issue by integrating external knowledge via a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach. More specifically, the DRoC decomposes VRP constraints, externally retrieves information relevant to each constraint, and synergistically combines internal and external knowledge to benefit the program generation for solving VRPs. The DRoC also allows LLMs to dynamically select between RAG and self-debugging mechanisms, thereby optimizing program generation without the need for additional training. Experiments across 48 VRP variants exhibit the superiority of DRoC, with significant improvements in the accuracy rate and runtime error rate delivered by the generated programs. The DRoC framework has the potential to elevate LLM performance in complex optimization tasks, fostering the applicability of LLMs in industries such as transportation and logistics."
Poster,DRoP: Distributionally Robust Data Pruning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28840,"Artem Vysogorets, Kartik Ahuja, Julia Kempe","In the era of exceptionally data-hungry models, careful selection of the training data is essential to mitigate the extensive costs of deep learning. Data pruning offers a solution by removing redundant or uninformative samples from the dataset, which yields faster convergence and improved neural scaling laws. However, little is known about its impact on classification bias of the trained models. We conduct the first systematic study of this effect and reveal that existing data pruning algorithms can produce highly biased classifiers. We present theoretical analysis of the classification risk in a mixture of Gaussians to argue that choosing appropriate class pruning ratios, coupled with random pruning within classes has potential to improve worst-class performance. We thus propose DRoP, a distributionally robust approach to pruning and empirically demonstrate its performance on standard computer vision benchmarks. In sharp contrast to existing algorithms, our proposed method continues improving distributional robustness at a tolerable drop of average performance as we prune more from the datasets."
Poster,Drop-Upcycling: Training Sparse Mixture of Experts with Partial Re-initialization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28794,"Taishi Nakamura, Takuya Akiba, Kazuki Fujii, Yusuke Oda, Rio Yokota, Jun Suzuki","The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture reduces the training and inference cost significantly compared to a dense model of equivalent capacity. Upcycling is an approach that initializes and trains an MoE model using a pre-trained dense model. While upcycling leads to initial performance gains, the training progresses slower than when trained from scratch, leading to suboptimal performance in the long term. We propose Drop-Upcycling - a method that effectively addresses this problem. Drop-Upcycling combines two seemingly contradictory approaches: utilizing the knowledge of pre-trained dense models while statistically re-initializing some parts of the weights. This approach strategically promotes expert specialization, significantly enhancing the MoE model's efficiency in knowledge acquisition. Extensive large-scale experiments demonstrate that Drop-Upcycling significantly outperforms previous MoE construction methods in the long term, specifically when training on hundreds of billions of tokens or more.As a result, our MoE model with 5.9B active parameters achieves comparable performance to a 13B dense model in the same model family, while requiring approximately 1/4 of the training FLOPs.All experimental resources, including source code, training data, model checkpoints and logs, are publicly available to promote reproducibility and future research on MoE."
Poster,DSBench: How Far Are Data Science Agents from Becoming Data Science Experts?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30458,"Liqiang Jing, Zhehui Huang, Xiaoyang Wang, Wenlin Yao, Wenhao Yu, Kaixin Ma, Hongming Zhang, Xinya Du, Dong Yu","Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive language/vision reasoning abilities, igniting the recent trend of building agents for targeted applications such as shopping assistants or AI software engineers. Recently, many data science benchmarks have been proposed to investigate their performance in the data science domain. However, existing data science benchmarks still fall short when compared to real-world data science applications due to their simplified settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce DSBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate data science agents with realistic tasks. This benchmark includes 466 data analysis tasks and 74 data modeling tasks, sourced from Eloquence and Kaggle competitions. DSBench offers a realistic setting by encompassing long contexts, multimodal task backgrounds, reasoning with large data files and multi-table structures, and performing end-to-end data modeling tasks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, LVLMs, and agents shows that they struggle with most tasks, with the best agent solving only 34.12% of data analysis tasks and achieving a 34.74% Relative Performance Gap (RPG). These findings underscore the need for further advancements in developing more practical, intelligent, and autonomous data science agents."
Poster,DS-LLM: Leveraging Dynamical Systems to Enhance Both Training and Inference of Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29827,"Ruibing Song, Chuan Liu, Chunshu Wu, Ang Li, Dongfang Liu, Yingnian Wu, Tong Geng","The training of large language models (LLMs) faces significant computational cost challenges, limiting their scalability toward artificial general intelligence (AGI) and broader adoption. With model sizes doubling approximately every 3.4 months and training costs escalating from 64 million USD for GPT-4 in 2020 to 191 million USD for Gemini Ultra in 2023, the economic burden has become unsustainable. While techniques such as quantization offer incremental improvements, they fail to address the fundamental computational bottleneck. In this work, we introduce DS-LLM, a novel framework that leverages dynamical system (DS)-based machines, which exploit Natural Annealing to rapidly converge to minimal energy states, yielding substantial efficiency gains. Unlike traditional methods, DS-LLM maps LLM components to optimization problems solvable via Hamiltonian configurations and utilizes continuous electric current flow in DS-machines for hardware-native gradient descent during training. We mathematically demonstrate the equivalence between conventional LLMs and DS-LLMs and present a method for transforming a trained LLM into a DS-LLM. Experimental evaluations across multiple model sizes demonstrate orders-of-magnitude improvements in speed and energy efficiency for both training and inference while maintaining consistent accuracy. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of the challenges and potential solutions associated with this emerging computing paradigm, aiming to lay a solid foundation for future research."
