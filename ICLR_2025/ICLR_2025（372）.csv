Poster,ViDiT-Q: Efficient and Accurate Quantization of Diffusion Transformers for Image and Video Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30429,"Tianchen Zhao, Tongcheng Fang, Haofeng Huang, Rui Wan, Widyadewi Soedarmadji, Enshu Liu, Shiyao Li, Zinan Lin, Guohao Dai, Shengen Yan, Huazhong Yang, Xuefei Ning, Yu Wang","Diffusion transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks, such as generating realistic images or videos based on textual instructions. However, larger model sizes and multi-frame processing for video generation lead to increased computational and memory costs, posing challenges for practical deployment on edge devices. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective method for reducing memory costs and computational complexity.When quantizing diffusion transformers, we find that existing quantization methods face challenges when applied to text-to-image and video tasks. To address these challenges, we begin by systematically analyzing the source of quantization error and conclude with the unique challenges posed by DiT quantization. Accordingly, we design an improved quantization scheme: ViDiT-Q (**V**ideo \& **I**mage **Di**ffusion **T**ransformer **Q**uantization), tailored specifically for DiT models. We validate the effectiveness of ViDiT-Q across a variety of text-to-image and video models, achieving W8A8 and W4A8 with negligible degradation in visual quality and metrics. Additionally, we implement efficient GPU kernels to achieve practical 2-2.5x memory optimization and a 1.4-1.7x end-to-end latency speedup."
Poster,VILA-U: a Unified Foundation Model Integrating Visual Understanding and Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31274,"Yecheng Wu, Zhuoyang Zhang, Junyu Chen, Haotian Tang, Dacheng Li, Yunhao Fang, Ligeng Zhu, Enze Xie, Hongxu Yin, Li Yi, Song Han, Yao Lu","VILA-U is a Unified foundation model that integrates Video, Image, Language understanding and generation. Traditional visual language models (VLMs) use separate modules for understanding and generating visual content, which can lead to misalignment and increased complexity. In contrast, VILA-U employs a single autoregressive next-token prediction framework for both tasks, eliminating the need for additional components like diffusion models. This approach not only simplifies the model but also achieves near state-of-the-art performance in visual language understanding and generation. The success of VILA-U is attributed to two main factors: the unified vision tower that aligns discrete visual tokens with textual inputs during pretraining, which enhances visual perception, and autoregressive image generation can achieve similar quality as diffusion models with high-quality dataset. This allows VILA-U to perform comparably to more complex models using a fully token-based autoregressive framework."
Poster,ViSAGe: Video-to-Spatial Audio Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30759,"Jaeyeon Kim, Heeseung Yun, Gunhee Kim","Spatial audio is essential for enhancing the immersiveness of audio-visual experiences, yet its production typically demands complex recording systems and specialized expertise. In this work, we address a novel problem of generating first-order ambisonics, a widely used spatial audio format, directly from silent videos. To support this task, we introduce YT-Ambigen, a dataset comprising 102K 5-second YouTube video clips paired with corresponding first-order ambisonics. We also propose new evaluation metrics to assess the spatial aspect of generated audio based on audio energy maps and saliency metrics. Furthermore, we present Video-to-Spatial Audio Generation (ViSAGe), an end-to-end framework that generates first-order ambisonics from silent video frames by leveraging CLIP visual features, autoregressive neural audio codec modeling with both directional and visual guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that ViSAGe produces plausible and coherent first-order ambisonics, outperforming two-stage approaches consisting of video-to-audio generation and audio spatialization. Qualitative examples further illustrate that ViSAGe generates temporally aligned high-quality spatial audio that adapts to viewpoint changes."
Poster,Vision and Language Synergy for Rehearsal Free Continual Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30681,"Muhammad Anwar Masum, Mahardhika Pratama, Savitha Ramasamy, Lin Liu, H Habibullah, Ryszard Kowalczyk","The prompt-based approach has demonstrated its success for continual learning problems. However, it still suffers from catastrophic forgetting due to inter-task vector similarity and unfitted new components of previously learned tasks. On the other hand, the language-guided approach falls short of its full potential due to minimum utilized knowledge and participation in the prompt tuning process. To correct this problem, we propose a novel prompt-based structure and algorithm that incorporate 4 key concepts (1) language as input for prompt generation (2) task-wise generators (3) limiting matching descriptors search space via soft task-id prediction (4) generated prompt as auxiliary data. Our experimental analysis shows the superiority of our method to existing SOTAs in CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, and CUB datasets with significant margins i.e. up to 30% final average accuracy, 24% cumulative average accuracy, 8% final forgetting measure, and 7% cumulative forgetting measure. Our historical analysis confirms our method successfully maintains the stability-plasticity trade-off in every task. Our robustness analysis shows the proposed method consistently achieves high performances in various prompt lengths, layer depths, and number of generators per task compared to the SOTAs. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, and complete numerical results in appendix sections. The method code is available in https://github.com/anwarmaxsum/LEAPGEN for further study."
Poster,Vision CNNs trained to estimate spatial latents learned similar ventral-stream-aligned representations,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28907,"Yudi Xie, Weichen Huang, Esther Alter, Jeremy Schwartz, Joshua B Tenenbaum, James DiCarlo","Studies of the functional role of the primate ventral visual stream have traditionally focused on object categorization, often ignoring -- despite much prior evidence -- its role in estimating ""spatial"" latents such as object position and pose. Most leading ventral stream models are derived by optimizing networks for object categorization, which seems to imply that the ventral stream is also derived under such an objective. Here, we explore an alternative hypothesis: Might the ventral stream be optimized for estimating spatial latents? And a closely related question: How different -- if at all -- are representations learned from spatial latent estimation compared to categorization? To ask these questions, we leveraged synthetic image datasets generated by a 3D graphic engine and trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to estimate different combinations of spatial and category latents. We found that models trained to estimate just a few spatial latents achieve neural alignment scores comparable to those trained on hundreds of categories, and the spatial latent performance of models strongly correlates with their neural alignment. Spatial latent and category-trained models have very similar -- but not identical -- internal representations, especially in their early and middle layers. We provide evidence that this convergence is partly driven by non-target latent variability in the training data, which facilitates the implicit learning of representations of those non-target latents. Taken together, these results suggest that many training objectives, such as spatial latents, can lead to similar models aligned neurally with the ventral stream. Thus, one should not assume that the ventral stream is optimized for object categorization only. As a field, we need to continue to sharpen our measures of comparing models to brains to better understand the functional roles of the ventral stream."
Poster,Vision Language Models are In-Context Value Learners,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28853,"Yecheng Jason Ma, Joey Hejna, Chuyuan Fu, Dhruv Shah, Jacky Liang, Zhuo Xu, Sean Kirmani, Peng Xu, Danny Driess, Ted Xiao, Osbert Bastani, Dinesh Jayaraman, Wenhao Yu, Tingnan Zhang, Dorsa Sadigh, Fei Xia","Predicting temporal progress from visual trajectories is important for intelligent robots that can learn, adapt, and improve. However, learning such progress estimator, or temporal value function, across different tasks and domains requires both a large amount of diverse data and methods which can scale and generalize. To address these challenges, we present Generative Value Learning (GVL), a universal value function estimator that leverages the world knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs) to predict task progress. Naively asking a VLM to predict values for a video sequence performs poorly due to the strong temporal correlation between successive frames. Instead, GVL poses value estimation as a temporal ordering problem over shuffled video frames; this seemingly more challenging task encourages VLMs to more fully exploit their underlying semantic and temporal grounding capabilities to differentiate frames based on their perceived task progress, consequently producing significantly better value predictions. Without any robot or task specific training, GVL can in-context zero-shot and few-shot predict effective values for more than 300 distinct real-world tasks across diverse robot platforms, including challenging bimanual manipulation tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GVL permits flexible multi-modal in-context learning via examples from heterogeneous tasks and embodiments, such as human videos. The generality of GVL enables various downstream applications pertinent to visuomotor policy learning, including dataset filtering, success detection, and value-weighted regression -- all without any model training or finetuning."
Poster,Vision-LSTM: xLSTM as Generic Vision Backbone,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29584,"Benedikt Alkin, Maximilian Beck, Korbinian Pöppel, Sepp Hochreiter, Johannes Brandstetter","Transformers are widely used as generic backbones in computer vision, despite initially introduced for natural language processing. Recently, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been extended to a scalable and performant architecture - the xLSTM - which overcomes long-standing LSTM limitations via exponential gating and parallelizable matrix memory structure. In this paper, we introduce Vision-LSTM (ViL), an adaption of the xLSTM building blocks to computer vision. ViL comprises a stack of xLSTM blocks where odd blocks process the sequence of patch tokens from top to bottom while even blocks go from bottom to top.ViL achieves strong performances on classification, transfer learning and segmentation tasks as well as a beneficial pre-training cost-to-performance trade-off. Experiments show that ViL holds promise to be further deployed as new generic backbone for computer vision architectures."
Poster,Vision-RWKV: Efficient and Scalable Visual Perception with RWKV-Like Architectures,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28412,"Yuchen Duan, Weiyun Wang, Zhe Chen, Xizhou Zhu, Lewei Lu, Tong Lu, Yu Qiao, Hongsheng Li, Jifeng Dai, Wenhai Wang","Transformers have revolutionized computer vision and natural language processing, but their high computational complexity limits their application in high-resolution image processing and long-context analysis. This paper introduces Vision-RWKV (VRWKV), a model that builds upon the RWKV architecture from the NLP field with key modifications tailored specifically for vision tasks. Similar to the Vision Transformer (ViT), our model demonstrates robust global processing capabilities, efficiently handles sparse inputs like masked images, and can scale up to accommodate both large-scale parameters and extensive datasets. Its distinctive advantage is its reduced spatial aggregation complexity, enabling seamless processing of high-resolution images without the need for window operations. Our evaluations demonstrate that VRWKV surpasses ViT's performance in image classification and has significantly faster speeds and lower memory usage processing high-resolution inputs. In dense prediction tasks, it outperforms window-based models, maintaining comparable speeds. These results highlight VRWKV's potential as a more efficient alternative for visual perception tasks.

Poster,VisRAG: Vision-based Retrieval-augmented Generation on Multi-modality Documents,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27679,"Shi Yu, Chaoyue Tang, Bokai Xu, Junbo Cui, Junhao Ran, Yukun Yan, Zhenghao Liu, Shuo Wang, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an effective technique that enables large language models (LLMs) to utilize external knowledge sources for generation.  However, current RAG systems are solely based on text, rendering it impossible to utilize vision information like layout and images that play crucial roles in real-world multi-modality documents.  In this paper, we introduce VisRAG, which tackles this issue by establishing a vision-language model (VLM)-based RAG pipeline.  In this pipeline, instead of first parsing the document to obtain text, the document is directly embedded using a VLM as an image and then retrieved to enhance the generation of a VLM. Compared to traditional text-based RAG, VisRAG maximizes the retention and utilization of the data information in the original documents, eliminating the information loss introduced during the parsing process. We collect both open-source and synthetic data to train the retriever in VisRAG and explore a variety of generation methods. Experiments demonstrate that VisRAG outperforms traditional RAG in both the retrieval and generation stages, achieving a 20–40% end-to-end performance gain over traditional text-based RAG pipeline. Further analysis reveals that VisRAG is efficient in utilizing training data and demonstrates strong generalization capability, positioning it as a promising solution for RAG on multi-modality documents.

Poster,VisualAgentBench: Towards Large Multimodal Models as Visual Foundation Agents,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31108,"Xiao Liu, Tianjie Zhang, Yu Gu, Iat Long Iong, Song XiXuan, Yifan Xu, Shudan Zhang, Hanyu Lai, Jiadai Sun, Xinyue Yang, Yu Yang, Zehan Qi, Shuntian Yao, Xueqiao Sun, Siyi Cheng, Qinkai Zheng, Hao Yu, Hanchen Zhang, Wenyi Hong, Ming Ding, Lihang Pan, Xiaotao Gu, Aohan Zeng, Zhengxiao Du, Chan Hee Song, Yu Su, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang","Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have ushered in a new era in artificial intelligence, merging capabilities in both language and vision to form highly capable \textbf{Visual Foundation Agents} that are postulated to excel across a myriad of tasks. However, existing benchmarks fail to sufficiently challenge or showcase the full potential of LMMs as visual foundation agents in complex, real-world environments. To address this gap, we introduce VisualAgentBench (VAB), a comprehensive and unified benchmark specifically designed to train and evaluate LMMs as visual foundation agents across diverse scenarios in one standard setting, including Embodied, Graphical User Interface, and Visual Design, with tasks formulated to probe the depth of LMMs' understanding and interaction capabilities. Through rigorous testing across 9 proprietary LMM APIs and 9 open models (18 in total), we demonstrate the considerable yet still developing visual agent capabilities of these models. Additionally, VAB explores the synthesizing of visual agent trajectory data through hybrid methods including Program-based Solvers, LMM Agent Bootstrapping, and Human Demonstrations, offering insights into obstacles, solutions, and trade-offs one may meet in developing open LMM agents. Our work not only aims to benchmark existing models but also provides an instrumental playground for future development into visual foundation agents.
