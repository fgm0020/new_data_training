Poster,Large-scale and Fine-grained Vision-language Pre-training for Enhanced CT Image Understanding,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28403,"Zhongyi Shui, Jianpeng Zhang, Weiwei Cao, Sinuo Wang, Ruizhe Guo, Le Lu, Lin Yang, Xianghua Ye, Tingbo Liang, Qi Zhang, Ling Zhang","Artificial intelligence (AI) shows great potential in assisting radiologists to improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical image interpretation and diagnosis. However, a versatile AI model requires large-scale data and comprehensive annotations, which are often impractical in medical settings. Recent studies leverage radiology reports as a naturally high-quality supervision for medical images, using contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) to develop language-informed models for radiological image interpretation. Nonetheless, these approaches typically contrast entire images with reports, neglecting the local associations between imaging regions and report sentences, which may undermine model performance and interoperability. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained vision-language model (fVLM) for anatomy-level CT image interpretation. Specifically, we explicitly match anatomical regions of CT images with corresponding descriptions in radiology reports and perform contrastive pre-training for each anatomy individually. Fine-grained alignment, however, faces considerable false-negative challenges, mainly from the abundance of anatomy-level healthy samples and similarly diseased abnormalities, leading to ambiguous patient-level pairings. To tackle this issue, we propose identifying false negatives of both normal and abnormal samples and calibrating contrastive learning from patient-level to disease-aware pairing. We curated the largest CT dataset to date, comprising imaging and report data from 69,086 patients, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 54 major and important disease (including several most deadly cancers) diagnosis tasks across 15 main anatomies. Experimental results demonstrate the substantial potential of fVLM in versatile medical image interpretation. In the zero-shot classification task, we achieved an average AUC of 81.3% on 54 diagnosis tasks, surpassing CLIP and supervised methods by 12.9% and 8.0%, respectively. Additionally, on the publicly available CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT benchmarks, our fVLM outperformed the current state-of-the-art methods with absolute AUC gains of 7.4% and 4.8%, respectively."
Poster,Large Scale Knowledge Washing,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28979,"Yu Wang, Ruihan Wu, Zexue He, Xiusi Chen, Julian McAuley","Large language models show impressive abilities in memorizing world knowledge, which leads to concerns regarding memorization of private information, toxic or sensitive knowledge, and copyrighted content. We introduce the problem of Large Scale Knowledge Washing, focusing on unlearning an extensive amount of factual knowledge. Previous unlearning methods usually define the reverse loss and update the model via backpropagation, which may affect the model's fluency and reasoning ability or even destroy the model due to extensive training with the reverse loss. Existing works introduce additional data from downstream tasks to prevent the model from losing capabilities, which requires downstream task awareness. Controlling the tradeoff of unlearning existing knowledge while maintaining existing capabilities is also challenging. To this end, we propose LaW (Large Scale Washing), where we update the MLP layers in decoder-only large language models to perform knowledge washing, as inspired by model editing methods. We derive a new objective with the knowledge to be unlearned to update the weights of certain MLP layers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LaW in forgetting target knowledge while maximally maintaining reasoning ability. The code will be open-sourced."
Poster,Large (Vision) Language Models are Unsupervised In-Context Learners,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28335,"Artyom Gadetsky, Andrei Atanov, Yulun Jiang, Zhitong Gao, Ghazal Hosseini Mighan, Amir Zamir, Maria Brbic","Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled zero-shot inference, allowing models to solve new tasks without task-specific training. Various adaptation techniques such as prompt engineering, In-Context Learning (ICL), and supervised fine-tuning can further enhance the model’s performance on a downstream task, but they require substantial manual effort to construct effective prompts or labeled examples. In this work, we introduce a joint inference framework for fully unsupervised adaptation, eliminating the need for manual prompt engineering and labeled examples. Unlike zero-shot inference, which makes independent predictions, the joint inference makes predictions simultaneously for all inputs in a given task. Since direct joint inference involves computationally expensive optimization, we develop efficient approximation techniques, leading to two unsupervised adaptation methods: unsupervised fine-tuning and unsupervised ICL. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across diverse tasks and models, including language-only Llama-3.1 on natural language processing tasks, reasoning-oriented Qwen2.5-Math on grade school math problems, vision-language OpenFlamingo on vision tasks, and the API-only access GPT-4o model on massive multi-discipline tasks. Our experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over the standard zero-shot approach, including 39% absolute improvement on the challenging GSM8K math reasoning dataset. Remarkably, despite being fully unsupervised, our framework often performs on par with supervised approaches that rely on ground truth labels."
Poster,LARP: Tokenizing Videos with a Learned Autoregressive Generative Prior,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29340,"Hanyu Wang, Saksham Suri, Yixuan Ren, Hao Chen, Abhinav Shrivastava","We present LARP, a novel video tokenizer designed to overcome limitations in current video tokenization methods for autoregressive (AR) generative models. Unlike traditional patchwise tokenizers that directly encode local visual patches into discrete tokens, LARP introduces a holistic tokenization scheme that gathers information from the visual content using a set of learned holistic queries. This design allows LARP to capture more global and semantic representations, rather than being limited to local patch-level information. Furthermore, it offers flexibility by supporting an arbitrary number of discrete tokens, enabling adaptive and efficient tokenization based on the specific requirements of the task. To align the discrete token space with downstream AR generation tasks, LARP integrates a lightweight AR transformer as a training-time prior model that predicts the next token on its discrete latent space. By incorporating the prior model during training, LARP learns a latent space that is not only optimized for video reconstruction but is also structured in a way that is more conducive to autoregressive generation. Moreover, this process defines a sequential order for the discrete tokens, progressively pushing them toward an optimal configuration during training, ensuring smoother and more accurate AR generation at inference time. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LARPs strong performance, achieving state-of-the-art FVD on the UCF101 class-conditional video generation benchmark. LARP enhances the compatibility of AR models with videos and opens up the potential to build unified high-fidelity multimodal large language models (MLLMs).

Poster,LASER: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Learning Spatio-Temporal Scene Graphs with Weak Supervision,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30236,"Jiani Huang, Ziyang Li, Mayur Naik, Ser-Nam Lim","Supervised approaches for learning spatio-temporal scene graphs (STSG) from video are greatly hindered due to their reliance on STSG-annotated videos, which are labor-intensive to construct at scale. Is it feasible to instead use readily available video captions as weak supervision? To address this question, we propose LASER, a neuro-symbolic framework to enable training STSG generators using only video captions. LASER employs large language models to first extract logical specifications with rich spatio-temporal semantic information from video captions. LASER then trains the underlying STSG generator to align the predicted STSG with the specification. The alignment algorithm overcomes the challenges of weak supervision by leveraging a differentiable symbolic reasoner and using a combination of contrastive, temporal, and semantics losses. The overall approach efficiently trains low-level perception models to extract a fine-grained STSG that conforms to the video caption. In doing so, it enables a novel methodology for learning STSGs without tedious annotations. We evaluate our method on three video datasets: OpenPVSG, 20BN, and MUGEN. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements over fully-supervised baselines, achieving a unary predicate prediction accuracy of 27.78% (+12.65%) and a binary recall@5 of 0.42 (+0.22) on OpenPVSG.  Additionally, LASER exceeds baselines by 7% on 20BN and 5.2% on MUGEN in terms of overall predicate prediction accuracy."
Poster,LASeR: Towards Diversified and Generalizable Robot Design with Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30803,"JUNRU SONG, Yang Yang, Huan Xiao, Wei Peng, Wen Yao, Feifei Wang","Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have stimulated a significant paradigm shift in evolutionary optimization, where hand-crafted search heuristics are gradually replaced with LLMs serving as intelligent search operators. However, these studies still bear some notable limitations, including a challenge to balance exploitation with exploration, often leading to inferior solution diversity, as well as poor generalizability of problem solving across different task settings. These unsolved issues render the prowess of LLMs in robot design automation largely untapped. In this work, we present LASeR -- Large Language Model-Aided Evolutionary Search for Robot Design Automation. Leveraging a novel reflection mechanism termed DiRect, we elicit more knowledgeable exploratory behaviors from LLMs based on past search trajectories, reshaping the exploration-exploitation tradeoff with dual improvements in optimization efficiency and solution diversity. Additionally, with evolution fully grounded in task-related background information, we unprecedentedly uncover the inter-task reasoning capabilities of LLMs, facilitating generalizable design processes that effectively inspire zero-shot robot proposals for new applications. Our simulated experiments on voxel-based soft robots showcase distinct advantages of LASeR over competitive baselines. Code at https://github.com/WoodySJR/LASeR."
Poster,Lasso Bandit with Compatibility Condition on Optimal Arm,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28898,"Harin Lee, Taehyun Hwang, Min-hwan Oh","We consider a stochastic sparse linear bandit problem where only a sparse subset of context features affects the expected reward function, i.e., the unknown reward parameter has a sparse structure.In the existing Lasso bandit literature, the compatibility conditions, together with additional diversity conditions on the context features are imposed to achieve regret bounds that only depend logarithmically on the ambient dimension $d$.In this paper, we demonstrate that even without the additional diversity assumptions, the \textit{compatibility condition on the optimal arm} is sufficient to derive a regret bound that depends logarithmically on $d$, and our assumption is strictly weaker than those used in the lasso bandit literature under the single-parameter setting.We propose an algorithm that adapts the forced-sampling technique and prove that the proposed algorithm achieves $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}\log dT)$ regret under the margin condition.To our knowledge, the proposed algorithm requires the weakest assumptions among Lasso bandit algorithms under the single-parameter setting that achieve $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}\log dT)$ regret.Through numerical experiments, we confirm the superior performance of our proposed algorithm."
Poster,Last Iterate Convergence of Incremental Methods as a Model of Forgetting,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28465,"Xufeng Cai, Jelena Diakonikolas","Incremental gradient and incremental proximal methods are a fundamental class of optimization algorithms used for solving finite sum problems, broadly studied in the literature. Yet, without strong convexity, their convergence guarantees have primarily been established for the ergodic (average) iterate. We establish the first nonasymptotic convergence guarantees for the last iterate of both incremental gradient and incremental proximal methods, in general convex smooth (for both) and convex Lipschitz (for the proximal variants) settings. Our oracle complexity bounds for the last iterate nearly match (i.e., match up to a square-root-log or a log factor) the best known oracle complexity bounds for the average iterate, for both classes of methods. We further obtain generalizations of our results to weighted averaging of the iterates with increasing weights and for randomly permuted ordering of updates. We study last iterate convergence of the incremental proximal method as a mathematical abstraction of forgetting in continual learning and prove a lower bound that certifies that a large amount of regularization is crucial to mitigating catastrophic forgetting---one of the key considerations in continual learning. Our results generalize last iterate guarantees for incremental methods compared to state of the art, as such results were previously known only for overparameterized linear models, which correspond to convex quadratic problems with infinitely many solutions."
Poster,Last-Iterate Convergence Properties of Regret-Matching Algorithms in Games,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29992,"Yang Cai, Gabriele Farina, Julien Grand-Clément, Christian Kroer, Chung-Wei Lee, Haipeng Luo, Weiqiang Zheng","We study last-iterate convergence properties of algorithms for solving two-player zero-sum games based on Regret Matching$^+$ (RM$^+$). Despite their widespread use for solving real games, virtually nothing is known about their last-iterate convergence. A major obstacle to analyzing RM-type dynamics is that their regret operators lack Lipschitzness and (pseudo)monotonicity.We start by showing numerically that several variants used in practice, such as RM$^+$, predictive RM$^+$ and alternating RM$^+$, all lack last-iterate convergence guarantees even on a simple $3\times 3$ matrix game.We then prove that recent variants of these algorithms based on a smoothing technique, extragradient RM$^{+}$ and smooth Predictive RM$^+$,  enjoy asymptotic last-iterate convergence (without a rate), $1/\sqrt{t}$ best-iterate convergence, and when combined with restarting, linear-rate last-iterate convergence. Our analysis builds on a new characterization of the geometric structure of the limit points of our algorithms, marking a significant departure from most of the literature on last-iterate convergence. We believe that our analysis may be of independent interest and offers a fresh perspective for studying last-iterate convergence in algorithms based on non-monotone operators."
Poster,Latent Action Pretraining from Videos,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29409,"Seonghyeon Ye, Joel Jang, Byeongguk Jeon, Se June Joo, Jianwei Yang, Baolin Peng, Ajay Mandlekar, Reuben Tan, Yu-Wei Chao, Bill Yuchen Lin, Lars Liden, Kimin Lee, Jianfeng Gao, Luke Zettlemoyer, Dieter Fox, Minjoon Seo","We introduce Latent Action Pretraining for general Action models (LAPA), the first unsupervised method for pretraining Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models without ground-truth robot action labels. Existing Vision-Language-Action models require action labels typically collected by human teleoperators during pretraining, which significantly limits possible data sources and scale. In this work, we propose a method to learn from internet-scale videos that do not have robot action labels. We first train an action quantization model leveraging VQ-VAE-based objective to learn discrete latent actions between image frames, then pretrain a latent VLA model to predict these latent actions from observations and task descriptions, and finally finetune the VLA on small-scale robot manipulation data to map from latent to robot actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing techniques that train robot manipulation policies from large-scale videos. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art VLA model trained with robotic action labels on real-world manipulation tasks that require language conditioning, generalization to unseen objects, and semantic generalization to unseen instructions. Training only on human manipulation videos also shows positive transfer, opening up the potential for leveraging web-scale data for robotics foundation models."
