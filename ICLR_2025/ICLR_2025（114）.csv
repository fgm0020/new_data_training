Poster,eQMARL: Entangled Quantum Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Cooperation over Quantum Channels,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29050,"Alexander DeRieux, Walid Saad","Collaboration is a key challenge in distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environments. Learning frameworks for these decentralized systems must weigh the benefits of explicit player coordination against the communication overhead and computational cost of sharing local observations and environmental data. Quantum computing has sparked a potential synergy between quantum entanglement and cooperation in multi-agent environments, which could enable more efficient distributed collaboration with minimal information sharing. This relationship is largely unexplored, however, as current state-of-the-art quantum MARL (QMARL) implementations rely on classical information sharing rather than entanglement over a quantum channel as a coordination medium. In contrast, in this paper, a novel framework dubbed entangled QMARL (eQMARL) is proposed. The proposed eQMARL is a distributed actor-critic framework that facilitates cooperation over a quantum channel and eliminates local observation sharing via a quantum entangled split critic. Introducing a quantum critic uniquely spread across the agents allows coupling of local observation encoders through entangled input qubits over a quantum channel, which requires no explicit sharing of local observations and reduces classical communication overhead. Further, agent policies are tuned through joint observation-value function estimation via joint quantum measurements, thereby reducing the centralized computational burden. Experimental results show that eQMARL with $\Psi^{+}$ entanglement converges to a cooperative strategy up to $17.8\\%$ faster and with a higher overall score compared to split classical and fully centralized classical and quantum baselines. The results also show that eQMARL achieves this performance with a constant factor of $25$-times fewer centralized parameters compared to the split classical baseline."
Poster,EqNIO: Subequivariant Neural Inertial Odometry,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30531,"Royina Karegoudra Jayanth, Yinshuang Xu, Ziyun Wang, Evangelos Chatzipantazis, Kostas Daniilidis, Daniel Gehrig","Neural network-based odometry using accelerometer and gyroscope readings from a single IMU can achieve robust, and low-drift localization capabilities, through the use of _neural displacement priors (NDPs)_. These priors learn to produce denoised displacement measurements but need to ignore data variations due to specific IMU mount orientation and motion directions, hindering generalization.This work introduces EqNIO, which addresses this challenge with _canonical displacement priors_, i.e., priors that are invariant to the orientation of the gravity-aligned frame in which the IMU data is expressed. We train such priors on IMU measurements, that are mapped into a learnable canonical frame, which is uniquely defined via three axes: the first is gravity, making the frame gravity aligned, while the second and third are predicted from IMU data.  The outputs (displacement and covariance) are mapped back to the original gravity-aligned frame. To maximize generalization, we find that these learnable frames must transform equivariantly with global gravity-preserving roto-reflections from the subgroup $O_g(3)\subset O(3)$, acting on the trajectory, rendering the NDP $O(3)$-_subequivariant_. We tailor specific linear, convolutional, and non-linear layers that commute with the actions of the group. Moreover, we introduce a bijective decomposition of angular rates into vectors that transform similarly to accelerations, allowing us to leverage both measurement types. Natively, angular rates would need to be inverted upon reflection, unlike acceleration, which hinders their joint processing. We highlight EqNIO's flexibility and generalization capabilities by applying it to both filter-based (TLIO), and end-to-end (RONIN) architectures, and outperforming existing methods that use _soft equivariance from auxiliary losses or data augmentation on various datasets. We believe this work paves the way for low-drift and generalizable neural inertial odometry on edge devices.

Poster,Equivariant Denoisers Cannot Copy Graphs: Align Your Graph Diffusion Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28333,"Najwa Laabid, Severi Rissanen, Markus Heinonen, Arno Solin, Vikas Garg","Graph diffusion models, dominant in graph generative modeling, remain underexplored for graph-to-graph translation tasks like chemical reaction prediction. We demonstrate that standard permutation equivariant denoisers face fundamental limitations in these tasks due to their inability to break symmetries in noisy inputs. To address this, we propose \emph{aligning} input and target graphs to break input symmetries while preserving permutation equivariance in non-matching graph portions. Using retrosynthesis (i.e., the task of predicting precursors for synthesis of a given target molecule) as our application domain, we show how alignment dramatically improves discrete diffusion model performance from $5$\% to a SOTA-matching $54.7$\% top-1 accuracy.

Poster,Equivariant Masked Position Prediction for Efficient Molecular Representation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29851,"Junyi An, Chao Qu, Yun-Fei Shi, XinHao Liu, Qianwei Tang, Fenglei Cao, Yuan Qi","Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown considerable promise in computational chemistry. However, the limited availability of molecular data raises concerns regarding GNNs' ability to effectively capture the fundamental principles of physics and chemistry, which constrains their generalization capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel self-supervised approach termed Equivariant Masked Position Prediction (EMPP), grounded in intramolecular potential and force theory. Unlike conventional attribute masking techniques, EMPP formulates a nuanced position prediction task that is more well-defined and enhances the learning of quantum mechanical features. EMPP also bypasses the approximation of the Gaussian mixture distribution commonly used in denoising methods, allowing for more accurate acquisition of physical properties. Experimental results indicate that EMPP significantly enhances performance of advanced molecular architectures, surpassing state-of-the-art self-supervised approaches. Our code is released in https://github.com/ajy112/EMPP."
Poster,Equivariant Neural Functional Networks for Transformers,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27995,"Viet-Hoang Tran, Thieu Vo, An Nguyen, Tho-Huu Tran, Minh-Khoi Nguyen-Nhat, Thanh Tran, Duy-Tung Pham, Tan Nguyen","This paper systematically explores neural functional networks (NFN) for transformer architectures. NFN are specialized neural networks that treat the weights, gradients, or sparsity patterns of a deep neural network (DNN) as input data and have proven valuable for tasks such as learnable optimizers, implicit data representations, and weight editing. While NFN have been extensively developed for MLP and CNN, no prior work has addressed their design for transformers, despite the importance of transformers in modern deep learning. This paper aims to address this gap by providing a systematic study of NFN for transformers. We first determine the maximal symmetric group of the weights in a multi-head attention module as well as a necessary and sufficient condition under which two sets of hyperparameters of the multi-head attention module define the same function. We then define the weight space of transformer architectures and its associated group action, which leads to the design principles for NFN in transformers. Based on these, we introduce Transformer-NFN, an NFN that is equivariant under this group action. Additionally, we release a dataset of more than 125,000 Transformers model checkpoints trained on two datasets with two different tasks, providing a benchmark for evaluating Transformer-NFN and encouraging further research on transformer training and performance."
Poster,Equivariant Symmetry Breaking Sets,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31458,"YuQing Xie, Tess Smidt","Equivariant neural networks (ENNs) have been shown to be extremely effective in applications involving underlying symmetries. By construction ENNs cannot produce lower symmetry outputs given a higher symmetry input. However, symmetry breaking occurs in many physical systems and we may obtain a less symmetric stable state from an initial highly symmetric one. Hence, it is imperative that we understand how to systematically break symmetry in ENNs. In this work, we propose a novel symmetry breaking framework that is fully equivariant and is the first which fully addresses spontaneous symmetry breaking. We emphasize that our approach is general and applicable to equivariance under any group. To achieve this, we introduce the idea of symmetry breaking sets (SBS). Rather than redesign existing networks, we design sets of symmetry breaking objects which we feed into our network based on the symmetry of our inputs and outputs. We show there is a natural way to define equivariance on these sets, which gives an additional constraint. Minimizing the size of these sets equates to data efficiency. We prove that minimizing these sets translates to a well studied group theory problem, and tabulate solutions to this problem for the point groups. Finally, we provide some examples of symmetry breaking to demonstrate how our approach works in practice. The code for these examples is available at \url{https://github.com/atomicarchitects/equivariant-SBS}."
Poster,Erasing Concept Combination from Text-to-Image Diffusion Model,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29839,"hongyi nie, Quanming Yao, Yang Liu, Zhen Wang, Yatao Bian","Advancements in the text-to-image diffusion model have raised security concerns due to their potential to generate images with inappropriate themes such as societal biases and copyright infringements. Current studies have made notable progress in preventing the model from generating images containing specific high-risk visual concepts. However, these methods neglect the issue that inappropriate themes may also arise from the combination of benign visual concepts. A crucial challenge arises because the same image theme can be represented through multiple distinct visual concept combinations, and the model's ability to generate individual concepts may become distorted when processing these combinations. Consequently, effectively erasing such visual concept combinations from the diffusion model remains a formidable challenge. To tackle this problem, we formalize the problem as the Concept Combination Erasing (CCE) problem and propose a Concept Graph-based high-level Feature Decoupling framework (CoGFD) to address CCE. CoGFD identifies and decomposes visual concept combinations with a consistent image theme from an LLM-induced concept logic graph, and erases these combinations through decoupling co-occurrent high-level features. These techniques enable CoGFD to eliminate undesirable visual concept combinations while minimizing adverse effects on the generative fidelity of related individual concepts, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Extensive experiments across diverse visual concept combination scenarios verify the effectiveness of CoGFD."
Poster,Error-quantified Conformal Inference for Time Series,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29659,"Junxi Wu, Dongjian Hu, Yajie Bao, Shu-Tao Xia, Changliang Zou","Uncertainty quantification in time series prediction is challenging due to the temporal dependence and distribution shift on sequential data. Conformal prediction provides a pivotal and flexible instrument for assessing the uncertainty of machine learning models through prediction sets. Recently, a series of online conformal inference methods updated thresholds of prediction sets by performing online gradient descent on a sequence of quantile loss functions. A drawback of such methods is that they only use the information of revealed non-conformity scores via miscoverage indicators but ignore error quantification, namely the distance between the non-conformity score and the current threshold. To accurately leverage the dynamic of miscoverage error, we propose Error-quantified Conformal Inference (ECI) by smoothing the quantile loss function. ECI introduces a continuous and adaptive feedback scale with the miscoverage error, rather than simple binary feedback in existing methods. We establish a long-term coverage guarantee for ECI under arbitrary dependence and distribution shift. The extensive experimental results show that ECI can achieve valid miscoverage control and output tighter prediction sets than other baselines."
Poster,ESE: Espresso Sentence Embeddings,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28282,"Xianming Li, Zongxi Li, Jing Li, Haoran Xie, Qing Li","High-quality sentence embeddings are fundamental in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as semantic textual similarity (STS) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, most existing methods leverage fixed-length sentence embeddings from full-layer language models, which lack the scalability to accommodate the diverse available resources across various applications. Viewing this gap, we propose a novel sentence embedding model Espresso Sentence Embeddings (ESE) with two learning processes. First, the learn-to-express process encodes more salient representations to shallow layers. Second, the learn-to-compress process compacts essential features into the initial dimensions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This way, ESE can scale model depth via the former process and embedding size via the latter. Extensive experiments on STS and RAG suggest that ESE can effectively produce high-quality sentence embeddings with less model depth and embedding size, enhancing inference efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/SeanLee97/AnglE/blob/main/README_ESE.md."
Poster,Estimating the Probabilities of Rare Outputs in Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30474,"Gabriel Wu, Jacob Hilton","We consider the problem of *low probability estimation*: given a machine learning model and a formally-specified input distribution, how can we estimate the probability of a binary property of the model's output, even when that probability is too small to estimate by random sampling? This problem is motivated by the need to improve worst-case performance, which distribution shift can make much more likely. We study low probability estimation in the context of argmax sampling from small transformer language models. We compare two types of methods: importance sampling, which involves searching for inputs giving rise to the rare output, and activation extrapolation, which involves extrapolating a probability distribution fit to the model's logits. We find that importance sampling outperforms activation extrapolation, but both outperform naive sampling. Finally, we explain how minimizing the probability estimate of an undesirable behavior generalizes adversarial training, and argue that new methods for low probability estimation are needed to provide stronger guarantees about worst-case performance."
