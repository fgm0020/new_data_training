Poster,MADGEN: Mass-Spec attends to De Novo Molecular generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30846,"Yinkai Wang, Xiaohui Chen, Liping Liu, Soha Hassoun","The annotation (assigning structural chemical identities) of MS/MS spectra remains a significant challenge due to the enormous molecular diversity in biological samples and the limited scope of reference databases.  Currently, the vast majority of spectral measurements remain in the ""dark chemical space"" without structural annotations.  To improve annotation, we propose MADGEN (Mass-spec Attends to De Novo Molecular GENeration), a scaffold-based method for de novo molecular structure generation guided by mass spectrometry data. MADGEN operates in two stages: scaffold retrieval and spectra-conditioned molecular generation starting with the scaffold. In the first stage, given an MS/MS spectrum, we formulate scaffold retrieval as a ranking problem and employ contrastive learning to align mass spectra with candidate molecular scaffolds. In the second stage, starting from the retrieved scaffold, we employ the MS/MS spectrum to guide an attention-based generative model to generate the final molecule. Our approach constrains the molecular generation search space, reducing its complexity and improving generation accuracy. We evaluate MADGEN on three datasets (NIST23, CANOPUS, and MassSpecGym) and  evaluate MADGEN's performance with a predictive scaffold retriever and with an oracle retriever. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using  attention to integrate spectral information throughout the generation process to achieve strong results with the oracle retriever."
Poster,MAD-TD: Model-Augmented Data stabilizes High Update Ratio RL,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30886,"Claas Voelcker, Marcel Hussing, ERIC EATON, Amir-massoud Farahmand, Igor Gilitschenski","Building deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents that find a good policy with few samples has proven notoriously challenging. To achieve sample efficiency, recent work has explored updating neural networks with large numbers of gradient steps for every new sample. While such high update-to-data (UTD) ratios have shown strong empirical performance, they also introduce instability to the training process.  Previous approaches need to rely on periodic neural network parameter resets to address this instability, but restarting the training process is infeasible in many real-world applications and requires tuning the resetting interval. In this paper, we focus on one of the core difficulties of stable training with limited samples: the inability of learned value functions to generalize to unobserved on-policy actions. We mitigate this issue directly by augmenting the off-policy RL training process with a small amount of data generated from a learned world model. Our method, Model-Augmented Data for TD Learning (MAD-TD) uses small amounts of generated data to stabilize high UTD training and achieve competitive performance on the most challenging tasks in the DeepMind control suite. Our experiments further highlight the importance of employing a good model to generate data, MAD-TD's ability to combat value overestimation, and its practical stability gains for continued learning."
Poster,MAESTRO: Masked Encoding Set Transformer with Self-Distillation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30353,"Matthew Lee, Jaesik Kim, Matei Ionita, Jonghyun Lee, Michelle McKeague, YONGHYUN NAM, Irene Khavin, Yidi Huang, Victoria Fang, Sokratis Apostolidis, Divij Mathew, Shwetank, Ajinkya Pattekar, Zahabia Rangwala, Amit Bar-Or, Benjamin Fensterheim, Benjamin Abramoff, Rennie Rhee, Damian Maseda, Allison Greenplate, John Wherry, Dokyoon Kim","The interrogation of cellular states and interactions in immunology research is an ever-evolving task, requiring adaptation to the current levels of high dimensionality. Cytometry enables high-dimensional profiling of immune cells, but its analysis is hindered by the complexity and variability of the data. We present MAESTRO, a self-supervised set representation learning model that generates vector representations of set-structured data, which we apply to learn immune profiles from cytometry data. Unlike previous studies only learn cell-level representations, whereas MAESTRO uses all of a sample's cells to learn a set representation. MAESTRO leverages specialized attention mechanisms to handle sets of variable number of cells and ensure permutation invariance, coupled with an online tokenizer by self-distillation framework. We benchmarked our model against existing cytometry approaches and other existing machine learning methods that have never been applied in cytometry. Our model outperforms existing approaches in retrieving cell-type proportions and capturing clinically relevant features for downstream tasks such as disease diagnosis and immune cell profiling."
Poster,MaestroMotif: Skill Design from Artificial Intelligence Feedback,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28331,"Martin Klissarov, Mikael Henaff, Roberta Raileanu, Shagun Sodhani, Pascal Vincent, Amy Zhang, Pierre-Luc Bacon, Doina Precup, Marlos C. Machado, Pierluca D&#x27;Oro","Describing skills in natural language has the potential to provide an accessible way to inject human knowledge about decision-making into an AI system. We present MaestroMotif, a method for AI-assisted skill design, which yields high-performing and adaptable agents. MaestroMotif leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively create and reuse skills. It first uses an LLM's feedback to automatically design rewards corresponding to each skill, starting from their natural language description. Then, it employs an LLM's code generation abilities, together with reinforcement learning, for training the skills and combining them to implement complex behaviors specified in language. We evaluate MaestroMotif using a suite of complex tasks in the NetHack Learning Environment (NLE), demonstrating that it surpasses existing approaches in both performance and usability."
Poster,MAGE: Model-Level Graph Neural Networks Explanations via Motif-based Graph Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27883,"Zhaoning Yu, Hongyang Gao","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in molecular tasks, yet their interpretability remains challenging. Traditional model-level explanation methods like XGNN and GNNInterpreter often fail to identify valid substructures like rings, leading to questionable interpretability. This limitation stems from XGNN's atom-by-atom approach and GNNInterpreter's reliance on average graph embeddings, which overlook the essential structural elements crucial for molecules. To address these gaps, we introduce an innovative **M**otif-b**A**sed **G**NN **E**xplainer (MAGE) that uses motifs as fundamental units for generating explanations. Our approach begins with extracting potential motifs through a motif decomposition technique. Then, we utilize an attention-based learning method to identify class-specific motifs. Finally, we employ a motif-based graph generator for each class to create molecular graph explanations based on these class-specific motifs. This novel method not only incorporates critical substructures into the explanations but also guarantees their validity, yielding results that are human-understandable. Our proposed method's effectiveness is demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative assessments conducted on six real-world molecular datasets."
Poster,MagicDec: Breaking the Latency-Throughput Tradeoff for Long Context Generation with Speculative Decoding,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30513,"Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Jian Chen, Zhuoming Chen, Vashisth Tiwari, Ruihang Lai, Jinyuan Shi, Ian Yen, Avner May, Tianqi Chen, Beidi Chen","Large Language Models (LLMs) have become more prevalent in long-context applications such as interactive chatbots, document analysis, and agent workflows, but it is challenging to serve long-context requests with low latency and high throughput. Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to reduce latency losslessly, but the conventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly, an intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing batch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy SD more effectively for high throughput inference. We leverage draft model with sparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck, which scales with both sequence length and batch size. Additionally, we propose a theoretical model to select the optimal drafting strategy for maximum speedup. Our work highlights the broad applicability of speculative decoding in long-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without compromising accuracy. For moderate to long sequences, we demonstrate up to 2.51x speedup for LLaMA-3.1-8B when serving batch sizes ranging from 32 to 256 on various types of hardware and tasks."
Poster,MagicPIG: LSH Sampling for Efficient LLM Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30638,"Zhuoming Chen, Ranajoy Sadhukhan, Zihao Ye, Yang Zhou, Jianyu Zhang, Niklas Nolte, Yuandong Tian, Matthijs Douze, Leon Bottou, Zhihao Jia, Beidi Chen","Large language models (LLMs) with long context windows have gained significant attention. However, the KV cache, stored to avoid re-computation, becomes a bottleneck. Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attention approximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight that attention is sparse. In this paper, we first show that TopK attention itself suffers from quality degradation in certain downstream tasks because attention is not always as sparse as expected. Rather than selecting the keys and values with the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees can provide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-based approximation practical in LLM generation, we propose MagicPIG, a heterogeneous system based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantly reduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracy for diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attention computation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and larger batch sizes with high approximation accuracy. MagicPIG can improve decoding throughput by up to $5\times$ across various GPU hardware and achieve 54ms decoding latency on a single RTX 4090 for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with a context of 96k tokens."
Poster,Magnetic Preference Optimization: Achieving Last-iterate Convergence for Language Model Alignment,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29766,"Mingzhi Wang, Chengdong Ma, Qizhi Chen, Linjian Meng, Yang Han, Jiancong Xiao, Zhaowei Zhang, Jing Huo, Weijie Su, Yaodong Yang","Self-play methods have demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing model capabilities across various domains. In the context of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), self-play not only boosts Large Language Model (LLM) performance but also overcomes the limitations of traditional Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumptions by finding the Nash equilibrium (NE) of a preference-based, two-player constant-sum game. However, existing methods either guarantee only average-iterate convergence, incurring high storage and inference costs, or converge to the NE of a regularized game, failing to accurately reflect true human preferences. In this paper, we introduce Magnetic Preference Optimization (MPO), a novel approach capable of achieving last-iterate convergence to the NE of the original game, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing methods. Building upon Magnetic Mirror Descent (MMD), MPO attains a linear convergence rate, making it particularly suitable for fine-tuning LLMs. To ensure our algorithm is both theoretically sound and practically viable, we present a simple yet effective implementation that adapts the theoretical insights to the RLHF setting. Empirical results demonstrate that MPO can significantly enhance the performance of LLMs, highlighting the potential of self-play methods in alignment."
Poster,MAGNet: Motif-Agnostic Generation of Molecules from Scaffolds,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30958,"Leon Hetzel, Johanna Sommer, Bastian Rieck, Fabian Theis, Stephan Günnemann","Recent advances in machine learning for molecules exhibit great potential for facilitating drug discovery from in silico predictions.Most models for molecule generation rely on the decomposition of molecules into frequently occurring substructures (motifs), from which they generate novel compounds. While motif representations greatly aid in learning molecular distributions, such methods fail to represent substructures beyond their known motif set, posing a fundamental limitation for discovering novel compounds.To address this limitation and enhance structural expressivity, we propose to separate structure from features by abstracting motifs to scaffolds and, subsequently, allocating atom and bond types. To this end, we introduce a novel factorisation of the molecules' data distribution that considers the entire molecular context and facilitates learning adequate assignments of atoms and bonds to scaffolds. Complementary to this, we propose MAGNet, the first model to freely learn motifs. Importantly, we demonstrate that MAGNet's improved expressivity leads to molecules with more structural diversity and, at the same time, diverse atom and bond assignments."
Poster,Magpie: Alignment Data Synthesis from Scratch by Prompting Aligned LLMs with Nothing,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29730,"Zhangchen Xu, Fengqing Jiang, Luyao Niu, Yuntian Deng, Radha Poovendran, Yejin Choi, Bill Yuchen Lin","High-quality instruction data is critical for aligning large language models (LLMs). Although some models, such as Llama-3-Instruct, have open weights, their alignment data remain private, which hinders the democratization of AI. High human labor costs and a limited, predefined scope for prompting prevent existing open-source data creation methods from scaling effectively, potentially limiting the diversity and quality of public alignment datasets. Is it possible to synthesize high-quality instruction data at scale by extracting it directly from an aligned LLM? We present a self-synthesis method for generating large-scale alignment data named Magpie.  Our key observation is that aligned LLMs like Llama-3-Instruct can generate a user query when we input only the pre-query templates up to the position reserved for user messages, thanks to their auto-regressive nature.  We use this method to prompt Llama-3-Instruct and generate 4 million instructions along with their corresponding responses. We further introduce extensions of Magpie for filtering, generating multi-turn, preference optimization, domain-specific and multilingual datasets. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the Magpie-generated data. To compare Magpie-generated data with other public instruction datasets (e.g., ShareGPT, WildChat, Evol-Instruct, UltraChat, OpenHermes, Tulu-V2-Mix, GenQA), we fine-tune Llama-3-8B-Base with each dataset and evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned models. Our results indicate that using Magpie for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) solely can surpass the performance of previous public datasets utilized for both SFT and preference optimization, such as direct preference optimization with UltraFeedback. We also show that in some tasks, models supervised fine-tuned with Magpie perform comparably to the official Llama-3-8B-Instruct, despite the latter being enhanced with 10 million data points through SFT and subsequent preference optimization. This advantage is evident on alignment benchmarks such as AlpacaEval, ArenaHard, and WildBench."
