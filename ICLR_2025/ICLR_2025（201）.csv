Poster,Long-time asymptotics of noisy SVGD outside the population limit,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29322,"Victor Priser, PASCAL BIANCHI, Adil Salim","Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) is a widely used sampling algorithm that has been successfully applied in several areas of Machine Learning. SVGD operates by iteratively moving a set of $n$ interacting particles (which represent the samples) to approximate the target distribution. Despite recent studies on the complexity of SVGD and its variants, their long-time asymptotic behavior (i.e., after numerous iterations $k$) is still not understood in the finite number of particles regime. We study the long-time asymptotic behavior of a noisy variant of SVGD. First, we establish that the limit set of noisy SVGD for large $k$ is well-defined. We then characterize this limit set, showing that it approaches the target distribution as $n$ increases. In particular, noisy SVGD avoids the variance collapse observed for SVGD. Our approach involves demonstrating that the trajectories of noisy SVGD closely resemble those described by a McKean-Vlasov process."
Poster,LongVILA: Scaling Long-Context Visual Language Models for Long Videos,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27865,"Yukang Chen, Fuzhao Xue, Dacheng Li, Qinghao Hu, Ligeng Zhu, Xiuyu Li, Yunhao Fang, Haotian Tang, Shang Yang, Zhijian Liu, Ethan He, Hongxu Yin, Pavlo Molchanov, Jan Kautz, Jim Fan, Yuke Zhu, Yao Lu, Song Han","Long-context capability is critical for multi-modal foundation models, especially for long video understanding. We introduce LongVILA, a full-stack solution for long-context visual-language models by co-designing the algorithm and system. For model training, we upgrade existing VLMs to support long video understanding by incorporating two additional stages, i.e., long context extension and long video supervised fine-tuning. However, training on long video is computationally and memory intensive. We introduce the long-context Multi-Modal Sequence Parallelism (MM-SP) system that efficiently parallelizes long video training and inference, enabling 2M context length training on 256 GPUs without any gradient checkpointing. LongVILA efficiently extends the number of video frames of VILA from 8 to 2048, achieving 99.8% accuracy in 6,000-frame (more than 1 million tokens) video needle-in-a-haystack. LongVILA-7B demonstrates strong accuracy on 9 popular video benchmarks, e.g., 65.1% VideoMME with subtitle. Besides, MM-SP is 2.1x - 5.7x faster than ring style sequence parallelism and 1.1x - 1.4x faster than Megatron with a hybrid context and tensor parallelism. Moreover, it seamlessly integrates with Hugging Face Transformers."
Poster,"LongWriter: Unleashing 10,000+ Word Generation from Long Context LLMs",https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28586,"Yushi Bai, Jiajie Zhang, Xin Lv, Linzhi Zheng, Siqi Zhu, Lei Hou, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang, Juanzi Li","Current long context large language models (LLMs) can process inputs up to 100,000 tokens, yet struggle to generate outputs exceeding even a modest length of 2,000 words. Through controlled experiments, we find that the model's effective generation length is inherently bounded by the sample it has seen during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In other words, their output limitation is due to the scarcity of long-output examples in existing SFT datasets. To address this, we introduce AgentWrite, an agent-based pipeline that decomposes ultra-long generation tasks into subtasks, enabling off-the-shelf LLMs to generate coherent outputs exceeding 20,000 words. Leveraging AgentWrite, we construct LongWriter-6k, a dataset containing 6,000 SFT data with output lengths ranging from 2k to 32k words. By incorporating this dataset into model training, we successfully scale the output length of existing models to over 10,000 words while maintaining output quality. We also develop LongBench-Write, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating ultra-long generation capabilities. Our 9B parameter model, further improved through DPO, achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark, surpassing even much larger proprietary models. In general, our work demonstrates that existing long context LLM already possesses the potential for a larger output window--all you need is data with extended output during model alignment to unlock this capability."
Poster,Look Before You Leap: Universal Emergent Mechanism for Retrieval in Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28935,"Alexandre Variengien, Eric Winsor","When solving challenging problems, language models (LMs) are able to identify relevant information from long and complicated contexts. To study how LMs solve retrieval tasks in diverse situations, we introduce ORION, a collection of structured retrieval tasks spanning six domains, from text understanding to coding. Each task in ORION can be represented abstractly by a request (e.g. a question) that retrieves an attribute (e.g. the character name) from a context (e.g. a story). We apply causal analysis on 18 open-source language models with sizes ranging from 125 million to 70 billion parameters. We find that LMs internally decompose retrieval tasks in a modular way: middle layers at the last token position process the request, while late layers retrieve the correct entity from the context. After causally enforcing this decomposition, models are still able to solve the original task, preserving 70% of the original correct token probability in 98 of the 106 studied model-task pairs. We connect our macroscopic decomposition with a microscopic description by performing a fine-grained case study of a question-answering task on Pythia-2.8b. Building on our high-level understanding, we demonstrate a proof of concept application for scalable internal oversight of LMs to mitigate prompt-injection while requiring human supervision on only a single input. Our solution improves accuracy drastically (from 15.5% to 97.5% on Pythia-12b). This work presents evidence of a universal emergent modular processing of tasks across varied domains and models and is a pioneering effort in applying interpretability for scalable internal oversight of LMs."
Poster,Looking Backward: Retrospective Backward Synthesis for Goal-Conditioned GFlowNets,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28879,"Haoran He, Can Chang, Huazhe Xu, Ling Pan","Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), a new family of probabilistic samplers, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities to generate diverse sets of high-reward candidates, in contrast to standard return maximization approaches (e.g., reinforcement learning) which often converge to a single optimal solution. Recent works have focused on developing goal-conditioned GFlowNets, which aim to train a single GFlowNet capable of achieving different outcomes as the task specifies. However, training such models is challenging due to extremely sparse rewards, particularly in high-dimensional problems. Moreover, previous methods suffer from the limited coverage of explored trajectories during training, which presents more pronounced challenges when only offline data is available. In this work, we propose a novel method called \textbf{R}etrospective \textbf{B}ackward \textbf{S}ynthesis (\textbf{RBS}) to address these critical problems. Specifically, RBS synthesizes new backward trajectories in goal-conditioned GFlowNets to enrich training trajectories with enhanced quality and diversity, thereby introducing copious learnable signals for effectively tackling the sparse reward problem. Extensive empirical results show that our method improves sample efficiency by a large margin and outperforms strong baselines on various standard evaluation benchmarks.

Poster,Looking Backward: Streaming Video-to-Video Translation with Feature Banks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/32105,"Feng Liang, Akio Kodaira, Chenfeng Xu, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Kurt Keutzer, Diana Marculescu","This paper introduces StreamV2V, a diffusion model that achieves real-time streaming video-to-video (V2V) translation with user prompts.   Unlike prior V2V methods using batches to process limited frames, we opt to process frames in a streaming fashion, to support unlimited frames.  At the heart of StreamV2V lies a backward-looking principle that relates the present to the past.   This is realized by maintaining a feature bank, which archives information from past frames.  For incoming frames, StreamV2V extends self-attention to include banked keys and values, and directly fuses similar past features into the output.  The feature bank is continually updated by merging stored and new features, making it compact yet informative.  StreamV2V stands out for its adaptability and efficiency, seamlessly integrating with image diffusion models without fine-tuning.  It can run 20 FPS on one A100 GPU, being 15$\times$, 46$\times$, 108$\times$, and 158$\times$ faster than FlowVid, CoDeF, Rerender, and TokenFlow, respectively.   Quantitative metrics and user studies confirm StreamV2V's exceptional ability to maintain temporal consistency."
Poster,Looking into User’s Long-term Interests through the Lens of Conservative Evidential Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28375,"Dingrong Wang, Krishna Neupane, Ervine Zheng, Qi Yu","Reinforcement learning (RL) provides an effective means to capture users' evolving preferences, leading to improved recommendation performance over time. However, existing RL approaches primarily rely on standard exploration strategies, which are less effective for a large item space with sparse reward signals given the limited interactions for most users. Therefore, they may not be able to learn the optimal policy that effectively captures user's evolving preferences and achieves the maximum expected reward over the long term. In this paper, we propose a novel evidential conservative Q-learning framework (ECQL) that learns an effective and conservative recommendation policy by integrating evidence-based uncertainty and conservative learning. ECQL conducts evidence-aware explorations to discover items that are located beyond current observations but reflect users' long-term interests. It offers an uncertainty-aware conservative view on policy evaluation to discourage deviating too much from users' current interests. Two central components of ECQL include a uniquely designed sequential state encoder and a novel conservative evidential-actor-critic (CEAC) module. The former generates the current state of the environment by aggregating historical information and a sliding window that contains the current user interactions as well as newly recommended items from RL exploration that may represent short and long-term interests respectively. The latter performs an evidence-based rating prediction by maximizing the conservative evidential Q-value and leverages an uncertainty-aware ranking score to explore the item space for a more diverse and valuable recommendation. Experiments on multiple real-world dynamic datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ECQL and its capability to capture users' long-term interests."
Poster,Looking Inward: Language Models Can Learn About Themselves by Introspection,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28917,"Felix Jedidja Binder, James Chua, Tomek Korbak, Henry Sleight, John Hughes, Robert Long, Ethan Perez, Miles Turpin, Owain Evans","Humans acquire knowledge by observing the external world, but also by introspection. Introspection gives a person privileged access to their current state of mind (e.g. thoughts and feelings) that are not accessible to external observers. Do LLMs have this introspective capability of privileged access? If they do, this would show that LLMs can acquire knowledge not contained in or inferable from training data.We investigate LLMs predicting properties of their own behavior in hypothetical situations. If a model M1 has this capability, it should outperform a different model M2 in predicting M1's behavior—even if M2 is trained on M1's ground-truth behavior.The idea is that M1 has privileged access to its own behavioral tendencies, and this enables it to predict itself better than M2 (even if M2 is generally stronger).In experiments with GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Llama-3 models, we find that the model M1 outperforms M2 in predicting itself, providing evidence for privileged access. Further experiments and ablations provide additional evidence.Our results show that LLMs can offer reliable self-information independent of external data in certain domains. By demonstrating this, we pave the way for further work on introspection in more practical domains, which would have significant implications for model transparency and explainability. However, while we successfully show introspective capabilities in simple tasks, we are unsuccessful on more complex tasks or those requiring out-of-distribution generalization."
Poster,Looped Transformers for Length Generalization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31126,"Ying Fan, Yilun Du, Kannan Ramchandran, Kangwook Lee","Recent work has shown that Transformers trained from scratch can successfully solve various arithmetic and algorithmic tasks, such as adding numbers and computing parity. While these Transformers generalize well on unseen inputs of the same length, they struggle with length generalization, i.e., handling inputs of unseen lengths. In this work, we demonstrate that looped Transformers with an adaptive number of steps significantly improve length generalization. We focus on tasks with a known iterative solution, involving multiple iterations of a RASP-L operation—a length-generalizable operation that can be expressed by a finite-sized Transformer. We train looped Transformers using our proposed learning algorithm and observe that they learn highly length-generalizable solutions for various tasks."
Poster,Loopy: Taming Audio-Driven Portrait Avatar with Long-Term Motion Dependency,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/32049,"Jianwen Jiang, Chao Liang, Jiaqi Yang, Gaojie Lin, Tianyun Zhong, Yanbo Zheng","With the introduction of video diffusion model, audio-conditioned human video generation has recently achieved significant breakthroughs in both the naturalness of motion and the synthesis of portrait details. Due to the limited control of audio signals in driving human motion, existing methods often add auxiliary spatial signals such as movement regions to stabilize movements, which compromise the naturalness and freedom of motion. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end audio-only conditioned video diffusion model named Loopy. Specifically, we designed two key modules: an inter- and intra-clip temporal module and an audio-to-latents module. These enable the model to better utilize long-term motion dependencies and establish a stronger audio-portrait movement correlation. Consequently, the model can generate more natural and stable portrait videos with subtle facial expressions, without the need for manually setting movement constraints. Extensive experiments show that Loopy outperforms recent audio-driven portrait diffusion models, delivering more lifelike and high-quality results across various scenarios.
