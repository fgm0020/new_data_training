Poster,Language-Assisted Feature Transformation for Anomaly Detection,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31115,"EungGu Yun, Heonjin Ha, Yeongwoo Nam, Bryan Lee","This paper introduces LAFT, a novel feature transformation method designed to incorporate user knowledge and preferences into anomaly detection using natural language. Accurately modeling the boundary of normality is crucial for distinguishing abnormal data, but this is often challenging due to limited data or the presence of nuisance attributes. While unsupervised methods that rely solely on data without user guidance are common, they may fail to detect anomalies of specific interest. To address this limitation, we propose Language-Assisted Feature Transformation (LAFT), which leverages the shared image-text embedding space of vision-language models to transform visual features according to user-defined requirements. Combined with anomaly detection methods, LAFT effectively aligns visual features with user preferences, allowing anomalies of interest to be detected. Extensive experiments on both toy and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method."
Poster,Language Guided Skill Discovery,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28721,"Seungeun Rho, Laura Smith, Tianyu Li, Sergey Levine, Xue Bin Peng, Sehoon Ha","Skill discovery methods enable agents to learn diverse emergent behaviors without explicit rewards. To make learned skills useful for downstream tasks, obtaining a semantically diverse repertoire of skills is crucial. While some approaches use discriminators to acquire distinguishable skills and others focus on increasing state coverage, the direct pursuit of ‘semantic diversity’ in skills remains underexplored. We hypothesize that leveraging the semantic knowledge of large language models (LLM) can lead us to improve semantic diversity of resulting behaviors. In this sense, we introduce Language Guided Skill Discovery (LGSD), a skill discovery framework that aims to directly maximize the semantic diversity between skills. LGSD takes user prompts as input and outputs a set of semantically distinctive skills. The prompts serve as a means to constrain the search space into a semantically desired subspace, and the generated LLM outputs guide the agent to visit semantically diverse states within the subspace. We demonstrate that LGSD enables legged robots to visit different user-intended areas on a plane by simply changing the prompt. Furthermore, we show that language guidance aids in discovering more diverse skills compared to five existing skill discovery methods in robot-arm manipulation environments. Lastly, LGSD provides a simple way of utilizing learned skills via natural language."
Poster,Language-Image Models with 3D Understanding,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27715,"Jang Hyun Cho, Boris Ivanovic, Yulong Cao, Edward Schmerling, Yue Wang, Xinshuo Weng, Boyi Li, Yurong You, Philipp Krähenbühl, Yan Wang, Marco Pavone","Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown incredible capabilities in a variety of 2D vision and language tasks. We extend MLLMs’ perceptual capabilities to ground and reason about images in 3-dimensional space. To that end, we first develop a large-scale pretraining dataset for 2D and 3D called LV3D by combining multiple existing 2D and 3D recognition datasets under a common task formulation: as multi-turn question-answering. Next, we introduce a new MLLM named CUBE-LLM and pre-train it on LV3D. We show that pure data scaling makes a strong 3D perception capability without 3D specific architectural design or training objective. CUBE-LLM exhibits intriguing properties similar to LLMs: (1) CUBE-LLM can apply chain-of-thought prompting to improve 3D understanding from 2D context information. (2) CUBE-LLM can follow complex and diverse instructions and adapt to versatile input and output formats. (3) CUBE-LLM can be visually prompted such as 2D box or a set of candidate 3D boxes from specialists. Our experiments on outdoor benchmarks demonstrate that CUBE-LLM significantly outperforms existing baselines by 21.3 points of AP-BEV on the Talk2Car dataset for 3D grounded reasoning and 17.7 points on the DriveLM dataset for complex reasoning about driving scenarios, respectively. CUBE-LLM also shows competitive results in general MLLM benchmarks such as refCOCO for 2D grounding with (87.0) average score, as well as visual question answering benchmarks such as VQAv2, GQA, SQA, POPE, etc. for complex reasoning."
Poster,Language Imbalance Driven Rewarding for Multilingual Self-improving,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30045,"Wen Yang, Junhong Wu, Chen Wang, Chengqing Zong, Jiajun Zhang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across numerous tasks. However, these advancements have predominantly benefited ""first-class"" languages such as English and Chinese, leaving many other languages underrepresented. This imbalance, while limiting broader applications, generates a natural preference ranking between languages, offering an opportunity to bootstrap the multilingual capabilities of LLM in a self-improving manner. Thus, we propose $\textit{Language Imbalance Driven Rewarding}$, where the inherent imbalance between dominant and non-dominant languages within LLMs is leveraged as a reward signal. Iterative DPO training demonstrates that this approach not only enhances LLM performance in non-dominant languages but also improves the dominant language's capacity, thereby yielding an iterative reward signal. Fine-tuning Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct over two iterations of this approach results in continuous improvements in multilingual performance across instruction-following and arithmetic reasoning tasks, evidenced by an average improvement of 7.46\% win rate on the X-AlpacaEval leaderboard and 13.9\% accuracy on the MGSM benchmark. This work serves as an initial exploration, paving the way for multilingual self-improvement of LLMs."
Poster,Language Model Alignment in Multilingual Trolley Problems,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/32081,"Zhijing Jin, Max Kleiman-Weiner, Giorgio Piatti, Sydney Levine, Jiarui Liu, Fernando Gonzalez Adauto, Francesco Ortu, András Strausz, Mrinmaya Sachan, Rada Mihalcea, Yejin Choi, Bernhard Schölkopf","We evaluate the moral alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences in multilingual trolley problems. Building on the Moral Machine experiment, which captures over 40 million human judgments across 200+ countries, we develop a cross-lingual corpus of moral dilemma vignettes in over 100 languages called MultiTP. This dataset enables the assessment of LLMs' decision-making processes in diverse linguistic contexts. Our analysis explores the alignment of 19 different LLMs with human judgments, capturing preferences across six moral dimensions: species, gender, fitness, status, age, and the number of lives involved. By correlating these preferences with the demographic distribution of language speakers and examining the consistency of LLM responses to various prompt paraphrasings, our findings provide insights into cross-lingual and ethical biases of LLMs and their intersection. We discover significant variance in alignment across languages, challenging the assumption of uniform moral reasoning in AI systems and highlighting the importance of incorporating diverse perspectives in AI ethics. The results underscore the need for further research on the integration of multilingual dimensions in responsible AI research to ensure fair and equitable AI interactions worldwide."
Poster,Language Models are Advanced Anonymizers,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30788,"Robin Staab, Mark Vero, Mislav Balunovic, Martin Vechev","Recent privacy research on large language models (LLMs) has shown that they achieve near-human-level performance at inferring personal data from online texts. With ever-increasing model capabilities, existing text anonymization methods are currently lacking behind regulatory requirements and adversarial threats. In this work, we take two steps to bridge this gap: First, we present a new setting for evaluating anonymization in the face of adversarial LLM inferences, allowing for a natural measurement of anonymization performance while remedying some of the shortcomings of previous metrics. Then, within this setting, we develop a novel LLM-based adversarial anonymization framework leveraging the strong inferential capabilities of LLMs to inform our anonymization procedure. We conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation of adversarial anonymization across 13 LLMs on real-world and synthetic online texts, comparing it against multiple baselines and industry-grade anonymizers. Our evaluation shows that adversarial anonymization outperforms current commercial anonymizers both in terms of the resulting utility and privacy. We support our findings with a human study (n=50) highlighting a strong and consistent human preference for LLM-anonymized texts."
Poster,Language Models Are Implicitly Continuous,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29613,"Samuele Marro, Davide Evangelista, X. Huang, Emanuele La Malfa, Michele Lombardi, Michael Wooldridge","Language is typically modelled with discrete sequences. However, the most successful approaches to language modelling, namely neural networks, are continuous and smooth function approximators.In this work, we show that Transformer-based language models implicitly learn to represent sentences as continuous-time functions defined over a continuous input space. This phenomenon occurs in most state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including Llama2, Llama3, Phi3, Gemma, Gemma2, and Mistral, and suggests that LLMs reason about language in ways that fundamentally differ from humans.Our work formally extends Transformers to capture the nuances of time and space continuity in both input and output space.Our results challenge the traditional interpretation of how LLMs understand language, with several linguistic and engineering implications."
Poster,Language Models Learn to Mislead Humans via RLHF,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27791,"Jiaxin Wen, Ruiqi Zhong, Akbir Khan, Ethan Perez, Jacob Steinhardt, Minlie Huang, Sam Bowman, He He, Shi Feng","Language models (LMs) can produce errors that are hard to detect for humans, especially when the task is complex.RLHF, the most popular post-training method, may exacerbate this problem: to achieve higher rewards, LMs might get better at convincing humans that they are right even when they are wrong. We study this phenomenon under a standard RLHF pipeline, calling it ``U-Sophistry'' since it is \textbf{U}nintended by model developers. Specifically, we ask time-constrained (e.g., 3-10 minutes) human subjects to evaluate the correctness of model outputs and calculate humans' accuracy against gold labels. On a question-answering task (QuALITY) and programming task (APPS), RLHF makes LMs better at convincing our subjects but not at completing the task correctly. RLHF also makes the model harder to evaluate: our subjects' false positive rate increases by 24.1% on QuALITY and 18.3% on APPS.Finally, we show that probing, a state-of-the-art approach for detecting \textbf{I}ntended Sophistry (e.g.~backdoored LMs), does not generalize to U-Sophistry. Our results highlight an important failure mode of RLHF and call for more research in assisting humans to align them."
Poster,Language Models Need Inductive Biases to Count Inductively,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28148,"Yingshan Chang, Yonatan Bisk","Counting constitutes a core skill underlying a wide range of tasks, such as formal language recognition, multi-hop reasoning and simulating algorithms. Generaliz- ing counting inductively is central to task success on out-of-distribution (OOD) instances where testing inputs are longer than those seen in training. While there is a large body of literature reporting poor length generalization in language models, few papers have tried to distill the “reasoning” failure to the simplest case of count- ing failure. We aim to provide a broader picture on whether various language model architectures can a) learn to count, and b) generalize counting inductively. This work provides extensive empirical results on architectures ranging from RNNs, Transformers, State-Space Models and RWKV. We present carefully-designed task formats, auxiliary tasks and positional embeddings to avoid limitations in general- ization with OOD-position and OOD-vocabulary. We find that while traditional RNNs trivially achieve inductive counting, Transformers have to rely on positional embeddings (PEs) to count OOD. Further analyses on interpreting the learned solution reveal that different PEs encode different inductive biases that facilitate counting in different task formats. As counting is the basis for many arguments concerning the expressivity of Transformers, our finding calls for the community to reexamine the application scope of primitive functions defined in formal charac- terizations. Finally, modern RNNs also largely underperform traditional RNNs in generalizing counting inductively, hinting at the tradeoff modern RNNs struggle to balance between parallelized training and maintaining their recurrent nature."
Poster,Language models scale reliably with over-training and on downstream tasks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28688,"Samir Yitzhak Gadre, Georgios Smyrnis, Vaishaal Shankar, Suchin Gururangan, Mitchell Wortsman, Rulin Shao, Jean Mercat, Alex Fang, Jeffrey Li, Sedrick Keh, Rui Xin, Marianna Nezhurina, Igor Vasiljevic, Luca Soldaini, Jenia Jitsev, Alex Dimakis, Gabriel Ilharco, Pang Wei Koh, Shuran Song, Thomas Kollar, Yair Carmon, Achal Dave, Reinhard Heckel, Niklas Muennighoff, Ludwig Schmidt","Scaling laws are useful guides for derisking expensive training runs, as they predict performance of large models using cheaper, small-scale experiments. However, there remain gaps between current scaling studies and how language models are ultimately trained and evaluated. For instance, scaling is usually studied in the compute-optimal training regime (i.e., ""Chinchilla optimal"" regime). In contrast, models are often over-trained to reduce inference costs. Moreover, scaling laws mostly predict loss on next-token prediction, but models are usually compared on downstream task performance. To address both shortcomings, we create a testbed of 104 models with 0.011B to 6.9B parameters trained with various numbers of tokens on three data distributions. First, we fit scaling laws that extrapolate in both the amount of over-training and the number of model parameters. This enables us to predict the validation loss of a 1.4B parameter, 900B token run (i.e., 32$\times$ over-trained) and a 6.9B parameter, 138B token run (i.e., a compute-optimal run)––each from experiments that take 300$\times$ less compute. Second, we relate the perplexity of a language model to its downstream task performance by proposing a power law. We use this law to predict top-1 error averaged over downstream tasks for the two aforementioned models, using experiments that take 20$\times$ less compute."
