Poster,Beyond-Expert Performance with Limited Demonstrations: Efficient Imitation Learning with Double Exploration,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30314,"Heyang Zhao, Xingrui Yu, David Bossens, Ivor Tsang, Quanquan Gu","Imitation learning is a central problem in reinforcement learning where the goal is to learn a policy that mimics the expert's behavior. In practice, it is often challenging to learn the expert policy from a limited number of demonstrations accurately due to the complexity of the state space. Moreover, it is essential to explore the environment and collect data to achieve beyond-expert performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel imitation learning algorithm called Imitation Learning with Double Exploration (ILDE), which implements exploration in two aspects: (1) optimistic policy optimization via an exploration bonus that rewards state-action pairs with high uncertainty to potentially improve the convergence to the expert policy, and (2) curiosity-driven exploration of the states that deviate from the demonstration trajectories to potentially yield beyond-expert performance. Empirically, we demonstrate that ILDE outperforms the state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and achieves beyond-expert performance on Atari and MuJoCo tasks with fewer demonstrations than in previous work. We also provide a theoretical justification of ILDE as an uncertainty-regularized policy optimization method with optimistic exploration, leading to a regret growing sublinearly in the number of episodes."
Poster,Beyond FVD: An Enhanced Evaluation Metrics for Video Generation Distribution Quality,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29066,"Ge Ya Luo, Gian M Favero, Zhi Hao Luo, Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau, Christopher Pal","The Fréchet Video Distance (FVD) is a widely adopted metric for evaluating video generation distribution quality. However, its effectiveness relies on critical assumptions. Our analysis reveals three significant limitations: (1) the non-Gaussianity of the Inflated 3D Convnet (I3D) feature space; (2) the insensitivity of I3D features to temporal distortions; (3) the impractical sample sizes required for reliable estimation. These findings undermine FVD's reliability and show that FVD falls short as a standalone metric for video generation evaluation. After extensive analysis of a wide range of metrics and backbone architectures, we propose JEDi, the JEPA Embedding Distance, based on features derived from a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture, measured using Maximum Mean Discrepancy with polynomial kernel.  Our experiments on multiple open-source datasets show clear evidence that it is a superior alternative to the widely used FVD metric, requiring only 16% of the samples to reach its steady value, while increasing alignment with human evaluation by 34%, on average.Project page: https://oooolga.github.io/JEDi.github.io/."
Poster,Beyond Graphs: Can Large Language Models Comprehend Hypergraphs?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31158,"Yifan Feng, Chengwu Yang, Xingliang Hou, Shaoyi Du, Shihui Ying, Zongze Wu, Yue Gao","Existing benchmarks like NLGraph and GraphQA evaluate LLMs on graphs by focusing mainly on pairwise relationships, overlooking the high-order correlations found in real-world data. Hypergraphs, which can model complex beyond-pairwise relationships, offer a more robust framework but are still underexplored in the context of LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce LLM4Hypergraph, the first comprehensive benchmark comprising 21,500 problems across eight low-order, five high-order, and two isomorphism tasks, utilizing both synthetic and real-world hypergraphs from citation networks and protein structures. We evaluate six prominent LLMs, including GPT-4o, demonstrating our benchmark’s effectiveness in identifying model strengths and weaknesses. Our specialized prompt- ing framework incorporates seven hypergraph languages and introduces two novel techniques, Hyper-BAG and Hyper-COT, which enhance high-order reasoning and achieve an average 4% (up to 9%) performance improvement on structure classification tasks. This work establishes a foundational testbed for integrating hypergraph computational capabilities into LLMs, advancing their comprehension."
Poster,Beyond Interpretability: The Gains of Feature Monosemanticity on Model Robustness,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28835,"Qi Zhang, Yifei Wang, Jingyi Cui, Xiang Pan, Qi Lei, Stefanie Jegelka, Yisen Wang","Deep learning models often suffer from a lack of interpretability due to \emph{polysemanticity}, where individual neurons are activated by multiple unrelated semantics, resulting in unclear attributions of model behavior. Recent advances in \emph{monosemanticity}, where neurons correspond to consistent and distinct semantics, have significantly improved interpretability but are commonly believed to compromise accuracy. In this work, we challenge the prevailing belief of the accuracy-interpretability tradeoff, showing that monosemantic features not only enhance interpretability but also bring concrete gains in model performance of {\color{black} robustness-related tasks}. Across multiple robust learning scenarios—including input and label noise, few-shot learning, and out-of-domain generalization—our results show that models leveraging monosemantic features significantly outperform those relying on polysemantic features. Furthermore, we provide empirical and theoretical understandings on the robustness gains of feature monosemanticity. Our preliminary analysis suggests that monosemanticity, by promoting better separation of feature representations, leads to more robust decision boundaries {\color{black} under noise}. This diverse evidence highlights the \textbf{generality} of monosemanticity in improving model robustness. As a first step in this new direction, we embark on exploring the learning benefits of monosemanticity beyond interpretability, supporting the long-standing hypothesis of linking interpretability and robustness.

Poster,Beyond Linear Approximations: A Novel Pruning Approach for Attention Matrix,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28105,"Yingyu Liang, Jiangxuan Long, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song, Yufa Zhou","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown immense potential in enhancing various aspects of our daily lives, from conversational AI to search and AI assistants. However, their growing capabilities come at the cost of extremely large model sizes, making deployment on edge devices challenging due to memory and computational constraints. This paper introduces a novel approach to LLM weight pruning that directly optimizes for approximating the attention matrix, a core component of transformer architectures. Unlike existing methods that focus on linear approximations, our approach accounts for the non-linear nature of the Softmax attention mechanism. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of our Gradient Descent-based optimization method to a near-optimal pruning mask solution. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our non-linear pruning approach in maintaining model performance while significantly reducing computational costs, which is beyond the current state-of-the-art methods, i.e., SparseGPT and Wanda, by a large margin. This work establishes a new theoretical foundation for pruning algorithm design in LLMs, potentially paving the way for more efficient LLM inference on resource-constrained devices."
Poster,Beyond Mere Token Analysis: A Hypergraph Metric Space Framework for Defending Against Socially Engineered LLM Attacks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28172,"Manohar Kaul, Aditya Saibewar, Sadbhavana Babar","Recent jailbreak attempts on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shifted from algorithm-focused to human-like social engineering attacks, with persuasion-based techniques emerging as a particularly effective subset. These attacks evolve rapidly, demonstrate high creativity, and boast superior attack success rates. To combat such threats, we propose a promising approach to enhancing LLM safety by leveraging the underlying geometry of input prompt token embeddings using hypergraphs. This approach allows us to model the differences in information flow between benign and malicious LLM prompts.In our approach, each LLM prompt is represented as a metric hypergraph, forming a compact metric space. We then construct a higher-order metric space over these compact metric hypergraphs using the Gromov-Hausdorff distance as a generalized metric. Within this space of metric hypergraph spaces, our safety filter learns to classify between harmful and benign prompts. Our study presents theoretical guarantees on the classifier's generalization error for novel and unseen LLM input prompts. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms both existing state-of-the-art generic defense mechanisms and naive baselines. Notably, our approach also achieves comparable performance to specialized defenses against algorithm-focused attacks."
Poster,Beyond Model Collapse: Scaling Up with Synthesized Data Requires Verification,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29933,"Yunzhen Feng, Elvis Dohmatob, Pu Yang, François Charton, Julia Kempe","Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly trained on data generated by other LLMs, either because generated text and images become part of the pre-training corpus, or because synthetized data is used as a replacement for expensive human-annotation. This raises concerns about *model collapse*, a drop in model performance when their training sets include generated data. Considering that it is easier for both humans and machines to tell between good and bad examples than to generate high-quality samples, we investigate the use of verification on synthesized data to prevent model collapse. We provide a theoretical characterization using Gaussian mixtures, linear classifiers, and linear verifiers to  derive conditions with measurable proxies to assess whether the verifier can effectively select synthesized data that leads to optimal performance. We experiment with two practical tasks -- computing matrix eigenvalues with transformers and news summarization with LLMs -- which both exhibit model collapse when trained on generated data, and show that verifiers, even imperfect ones, can indeed be harnessed to prevent model collapse and that our proposed proxy measure strongly correlates with performance."
Poster,Beyond Next Token Prediction: Patch-Level Training for Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28998,"Chenze Shao, Fandong Meng, Jie Zhou","The prohibitive training costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a significant bottleneck in the development of next-generation LLMs. In this paper, we show that it is possible to significantly reduce the training costs of LLMs without sacrificing their performance. Specifically, we introduce patch-level training for LLMs, in which multiple tokens are aggregated into a unit of higher information density, referred to as a `patch', to serve as the fundamental text unit for training LLMs. During patch-level training, we feed the language model shorter sequences of patches and train it to predict the next patch, thereby processing the majority of the training data at a significantly reduced cost. Following this, the model continues token-level training on the remaining training data to align with the inference mode. Experiments on a diverse range of models (370M-2.7B parameters) demonstrate that patch-level training can reduce the overall training costs to 0.5$\times$, without compromising the model performance compared to token-level training.

Poster,Beyond Random Augmentations: Pretraining with Hard Views,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30639,"Fabio Ferreira, Ivo Rapant, Jörg Franke, Frank Hutter","Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods typically rely on random image augmentations, or views, to make models invariant to different transformations. We hypothesize that the efficacy of pretraining pipelines based on conventional random view sampling can be enhanced by explicitly selecting views that benefit the learning progress. A simple yet effective approach is to select hard views that yield a higher loss. In this paper, we propose Hard View Pretraining (HVP), a learning-free strategy that extends random view generation by exposing models to more challenging samples during SSL pretraining. HVP encompasses the following iterative steps: 1) randomly sample multiple views and forward each view through the pretrained model, 2) create pairs of two views and compute their loss, 3) adversarially select the pair yielding the highest loss according to the current model state, and 4) perform a backward pass with the selected pair. In contrast to existing hard view literature, we are the first to demonstrate hard view pretraining's effectiveness at scale, particularly training on the full ImageNet-1k dataset, and evaluating across multiple SSL methods, Convolutional Networks, and Vision Transformers. As a result, HVP sets a new state-of-the-art on DINO ViT-B/16, reaching 78.8% linear evaluation accuracy (a 0.6% improvement) and consistent gains of 1% for both 100 and 300 epoch pretraining, with similar improvements across transfer tasks in DINO, SimSiam, iBOT, and SimCLR."
Poster,Beyond Random Masking: When Dropout meets Graph Convolutional Networks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29723,"Yuankai Luo, Xiao-Ming Wu, Hao Zhu","Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning on graph-structured data, yet the behavior of dropout in these models remains poorly understood. This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical analysis of dropout in GCNs, revealing that its primary role differs fundamentally from standard neural networks - preventing oversmoothing rather than co-adaptation. We demonstrate that dropout in GCNs creates dimension-specific stochastic sub-graphs, leading to a form of structural regularization not present in standard neural networks. Our analysis shows that dropout effects are inherently degree-dependent, resulting in adaptive regularization that considers the topological importance of nodes. We provide new insights into dropout's role in mitigating oversmoothing and derive novel generalization bounds that account for graph-specific dropout effects. Furthermore, we analyze the synergistic interaction between dropout and batch normalization in GCNs, uncovering a mechanism that enhances overall regularization. Our theoretical findings are validated through extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level tasks across 14 datasets. Notably, GCN with dropout and batch normalization outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, demonstrating the practical impact of our theoretical insights."
