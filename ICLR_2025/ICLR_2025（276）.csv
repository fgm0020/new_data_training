Poster,R2Det: Exploring Relaxed Rotation Equivariance in 2D Object Detection,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30402,"Zhiqiang Wu, Yingjie Liu, Hanlin Dong, Xuan Tang, Jian Yang, Bo Jin, Mingsong Chen, Xian Wei","Group Equivariant Convolution (GConv) empowers models to explore underlying symmetry in data, improving performance. However, real-world scenarios often deviate from ideal symmetric systems caused by physical permutation, characterized by non-trivial actions of a symmetry group, resulting in asymmetries that affect the outputs, a phenomenon known as Symmetry Breaking. Traditional GConv-based methods are constrained by rigid operational rules within group space, assuming data remains strictly symmetry after limited group transformations. This limitation makes it difficult to adapt to Symmetry-Breaking and non-rigid transformations. Motivated by this, we mainly focus on a common scenario: Rotational Symmetry-Breaking. By relaxing strict group transformations within Strict Rotation-Equivariant group $\mathbf{C}_n$, we redefine a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant group $\mathbf{R}_n$ and introduce a novel Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant GConv (R2GConv) with only a minimal increase of $4n$ parameters compared to GConv. Based on R2GConv, we propose a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant Network (R2Net) as the backbone and develop a Relaxed Rotation-Equivariant Object Detector (R2Det) for 2D object detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed R2GConv in natural image classification, and R2Det achieves excellent performance in 2D object detection with improved generalization capabilities and robustness. The code is available in \texttt{https://github.com/wuer5/r2det}."
Poster,Radar: Fast Long-Context Decoding for Any Transformer,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29218,"Yongchang Hao, Mengyao Zhai, Hossein Hajimirsadeghi, Sepidehsadat Hosseini, Frederick Tung","Transformer models have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of applications. Though forming the foundation of Transformer models, the dot-product attention does not scale well to long-context data since its time requirement grows quadratically with context length. In this work, we propose Radar, a training-free approach that accelerates inference by dynamically searching for the most important context tokens. For any pre-trained Transformer, Radar can reduce the decoding time complexity without training or heuristically evicting tokens. Moreover, we provide theoretical justification for our approach, demonstrating that Radar can reliably identify the most important tokens with high probability. We conduct extensive comparisons with the previous methods on a wide range of tasks. The results demonstrate that Radar achieves the state-of-the-art performance across different architectures with reduced time complexity, offering a practical solution for efficient long-context processing of Transformers. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/BorealisAI/radar-decoding."
Poster,RAFT: Reward rAnked FineTuning for Generative Foundation Model Alignment,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31508,"Jipeng Zhang, Hanze Dong, Tong Zhang, Wei Xiong, Deepanshu Goyal, Yihan Zhang, Winnie Chow, KaShun SHUM, Shizhe Diao, Rui Pan","Generative foundation models are susceptible to implicit biases that can arise from extensive unsupervised training data. Such biases can produce suboptimal samples, skewed outcomes, and unfairness, with potentially serious consequences. Consequently, aligning these models with human ethics and preferences is an essential step toward ensuring their responsible and effective deployment in real-world applications. Prior research has primarily employed Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to address this problem, where generative models are fine-tuned with RL algorithms guided by a human-feedback-informed reward model. However, the inefficiencies and instabilities associated with RL algorithms frequently present substantial obstacles to the successful alignment, necessitating the development of a more robust and streamlined approach. To this end, we introduce a new framework, Reward rAnked FineTuning (RAFT), designed to align generative models effectively. Utilizing a reward model and a sufficient number of samples, our approach selects the high-quality samples, discarding those that exhibit undesired behavior, and subsequently enhancing the model by fine-tuning on these filtered samples. Our studies show that RAFT can effectively improve the model performance in both reward learning and other automated metrics in both large language models and diffusion models."
Poster,RAG-DDR: Optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation Using Differentiable Data Rewards,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29729,"Xinze Li, Sen Mei, Zhenghao Liu, Yukun Yan, Shuo Wang, Shi Yu, Zheni Zeng, Hao Chen, Ge Yu, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun, Chenyan Xiong","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving knowledge from external resources. To adapt LLMs for the RAG systems, current approaches use instruction tuning to optimize LLMs, improving their ability to utilize retrieved knowledge. This supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach focuses on equipping LLMs to handle diverse RAG tasks using different instructions. However, it trains RAG modules to overfit training signals and overlooks the varying data preferences among agents within the RAG system. In this paper, we propose a Differentiable Data Rewards (DDR) method, which end-to-end trains RAG systems by aligning data preferences between different RAG modules. DDR works by collecting the rewards to optimize each agent in the RAG system with the rollout method, which prompts agents to sample some potential responses as perturbations, evaluates the impact of these perturbations on the whole RAG system, and subsequently optimizes the agent to produce outputs that improve the performance of the RAG system. Our experiments on various knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate that DDR significantly outperforms the SFT method, particularly for LLMs with smaller-scale parameters that depend more on the retrieved knowledge. Additionally, DDR exhibits a stronger capability to align the data preference between RAG modules. The DDR method makes the generation module more effective in extracting key information from documents and mitigating conflicts between parametric memory and external knowledge.

Poster,RAG-SR: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Neural Symbolic Regression,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29868,"Hengzhe Zhang, Qi Chen, Bing XUE, Wolfgang Banzhaf, Mengjie Zhang","Symbolic regression is a key task in machine learning, aiming to discover mathematical expressions that best describe a dataset. While deep learning has increased interest in using neural networks for symbolic regression, many existing approaches rely on pre-trained models. These models require significant computational resources and struggle with regression tasks involving unseen functions and variables. A pre-training-free paradigm is needed to better integrate with search-based symbolic regression algorithms. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for symbolic regression that integrates evolutionary feature construction with a neural network, without the need for pre-training. Our approach adaptively generates symbolic trees that align with the desired semantics in real-time using a language model trained via online supervised learning, providing effective building blocks for feature construction. To mitigate hallucinations from the language model, we design a retrieval-augmented generation mechanism that explicitly leverages searched symbolic expressions. Additionally, we introduce a scale-invariant data augmentation technique that further improves the robustness and generalization of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across 25 regression algorithms and 120 regression tasks."
Poster,RainbowPO: A Unified Framework for Combining Improvements in Preference Optimization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28018,"Hanyang Zhao, Genta Winata, Anirban Das, Shi-Xiong Zhang, David Yao, Wenpin Tang, Sambit Sahu","Recently, numerous preference optimization algorithms have been introduced as extensions to the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) family. While these methods have successfully aligned models with human preferences, there is a lack of understanding regarding the contributions of their additional components. Moreover, fair and consistent comparisons are scarce, making it difficult to discern which components genuinely enhance downstream performance. In this work, we propose RainbowPO, a unified framework that demystifies the effectiveness of existing DPO methods by categorizing their key components into seven broad directions. We integrate these components into a single cohesive objective, enhancing the performance of each individual element. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RainbowPO outperforms existing DPO variants. Additionally, we provide insights to guide researchers in developing new DPO methods and assist practitioners in their implementations."
Poster,RandLoRA: Full rank parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30212,"Paul Albert, Frederic Zhang, Hemanth Saratchandran, Cristian Rodriguez-Opazo, Anton Hengel, Ehsan Abbasnejad","Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants have shown impressive results in reducing the number of trainable parameters and memory requirements of large transformer networks while maintaining fine-tuning performance. The low-rank nature of the weight update inherently limits the representation power of fine-tuned models, however, thus potentially compromising performance on complex tasks. This raises a critical question: when a performance gap between LoRA and standard fine-tuning is observed, is it due to the reduced number of train-able parameters or the rank deficiency? This paper aims to answer this question by introducing RandLoRA, a parameter-efficient method that performs full-rank updates using a learned linear combinations of low-rank, non-trainable random matrices. Our method limits the number of trainable parameters by restricting optimization to diagonal scaling matrices applied to the fixed random matrices. This allows us to effectively overcome the low-rank limitations while maintaining parameter and memory efficiency during training. Through extensive experimen-tation across vision, language, and vision-language benchmarks, we systematically evaluate the limitations of LoRA and existing random basis methods. Our findings reveal that full-rank updates are beneficial across vision and language tasks individually, and even more so for vision-language tasks, where RandLoRA significantly reduces—and sometimes eliminates—the performance gap between standard fine-tuning and LoRA, demonstrating its efficacy."
Poster,Random Is All You Need: Random Noise Injection on Feature Statistics for Generalizable Deep Image Denoising,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27690,"Zhengwei Yin, Hongjun Wang, Guixu Lin, Weihang Ran, Yinqiang Zheng","Recent advancements in generalizable deep image denoising have catalyzed the development of robust noise-handling models. The current state-of-the-art, Masked Training (MT), constructs a masked swinir model which is trained exclusively on Gaussian noise ($\sigma$=15) but can achieve commendable denoising performance across various noise types (*i.e.* speckle noise, poisson noise). However, this method, while focusing on content reconstruction, often produces over-smoothed images and poses challenges in mask ratio optimization, complicating its integration with other methodologies. In response, this paper introduces RNINet, a novel architecture built on a streamlined encoder-decoder framework to enhance both efficiency and overall performance. Initially, we train a pure RNINet (only simple encoder-decoder) on individual noise types, observing that feature statistics such as mean and variance shift in response to different noise conditions. Leveraging these insights, we incorporate a noise injection block that injects random noise into feature statistics within our framework, significantly improving generalization across unseen noise types. Our framework not only simplifies the architectural complexity found in MT but also delivers superior performance. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms MT in various unseen noise conditions in terms of denoising effectiveness and computational efficiency (lower MACs and GPU memory usage), achieving up to 10 times faster inference speeds and underscoring it's capability for large scale deployments."
Poster,Random-Set Neural Networks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28286,"Shireen Kudukkil Manchingal, Muhammad Mubashar, Kaizheng Wang, Keivan Shariatmadar, Fabio Cuzzolin","Machine learning is increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains where erroneous predictions may lead to potentially catastrophic consequences, highlighting the need for learning systems to be aware of how confident they are in their own predictions: in other words, 'to know when they do not know’. In this paper, we propose a novel Random-Set Neural Network (RS-NN) approach to classification which predicts *belief functions* (rather than classical probability vectors) over the class list using the mathematics of *random sets*, i.e., distributions over the collection of *sets* of classes. RS-NN encodes the 'epistemic' uncertainty induced by training sets that are insufficiently representative or limited in size via the size of the convex set of probability vectors associated with a predicted belief function. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art Bayesian and Ensemble methods in terms of accuracy, uncertainty estimation and out-of-distribution (OoD) detection on multiple benchmarks (CIFAR-10 vs SVHN/Intel-Image, MNIST vs FMNIST/KMNIST, ImageNet vs ImageNet-O). RS-NN also scales up effectively to large-scale architectures (e.g. WideResNet-28-10, VGG16, Inception V3, EfficientNetB2 and ViT-Base-16),exhibits remarkable robustness to adversarial attacks and can provide statistical guarantees in a conformal learning setting."
Poster,"Range, not Independence, Drives Modularity in Biologically Inspired Representations",https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30538,"Will Dorrell, Kyle Hsu, Luke Hollingsworth, Jin Hwa Lee, Jiajun Wu, Chelsea Finn, Peter Latham, Timothy Behrens, James Whittington","Why do biological and artificial neurons sometimes modularise, each encoding a single meaningful variable, and sometimes entangle their representation of many variables? In this work, we develop a theory of when biologically inspired networks---those that are nonnegative and energy efficient---modularise their representation of source variables (sources). We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on a sample of sources that determine whether the neurons in an optimal biologically-inspired linear autoencoder modularise. Our theory applies to any dataset, extending far beyond the case of statistical independence studied in previous work. Rather we show that sources modularise if their support is ``sufficiently spread''. From this theory, we extract and validate predictions in a variety of empirical studies on how data distribution affects modularisation in nonlinear feedforward and recurrent neural networks trained on supervised and unsupervised tasks. Furthermore, we apply these ideas to neuroscience data, showing that range independence can be used to understand the mixing or modularising of spatial and reward information in entorhinal recordings in seemingly conflicting experiments. Further, we use these results to suggest alternate origins of mixed-selectivity, beyond the predominant theory of flexible nonlinear classification. In sum, our theory prescribes precise conditions on when neural activities modularise, providing tools for inducing and elucidating modular representations in brains and machines."
