Poster,PALMBENCH: A COMPREHENSIVE BENCHMARK OF COMPRESSED LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS ON MOBILE PLATFORMS,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27755,"Yilong Li, Jingyu Liu, Hao Zhang, Badri Narayanan Murali Krishnan, Utkarsh Sharma, Shuai Zhang, Yijing Zeng, Jayaram Raghuram, Suman Banerjee","Deploying large language models (LLMs) locally on mobile devices is advantageous in scenarios where transmitting data to remote cloud servers is either undesirable due to privacy concerns or impractical due to network connection. Recent advancements have facilitated the local deployment of LLMs. However, local deployment also presents challenges, particularly in balancing quality (generative performance), latency, and throughput within the hardware constraints of mobile devices. In this paper, we introduce our lightweight, all-in-one automated benchmarking framework that allows users to evaluate LLMs on mobile devices. We provide a comprehensive benchmark of various popular LLMs with different quantization configurations (both weights and activations) across multiple mobile platforms with varying hardware capabilities. Unlike traditional benchmarks that assess full-scale models on high-end GPU clusters, we focus on evaluating resource efficiency (memory and power consumption) and harmful output for compressed models on mobile devices. Our key observations include: i) differences in energy efficiency and throughput across mobile platforms; ii) the impact of quantization on memory usage, GPU execution time, and power consumption; and iii) accuracy and performance degradation of quantized models compared to their non-quantized counterparts; and iv) the frequency of hallucinations and toxic content generated by compressed LLMs onmobile devices."
Poster,PAL: Sample-Efficient Personalized Reward Modeling for Pluralistic Alignment,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31187,"Daiwei Chen, Yi Chen, Aniket Rege, Zhi Wang, Ramya Vinayak","Foundation models trained on internet-scale data benefit from extensive alignment to human preferences before deployment. However, existing methods typically assume a homogeneous preference shared by all individuals, overlooking the diversity inherent in human values. In this work, we propose a general reward modeling framework for pluralistic alignment (PAL), which incorporates diverse preferences from the ground up. PAL has a modular design that leverages commonalities across users while catering to individual personalization, enabling efficient few-shot localization of preferences for new users. Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that PAL matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both text-to-text and text-to-image tasks: on Reddit TL;DR Summary, PAL is 1.7% more accurate for seen users and 36% more accurate for unseen users compared to the previous best method, with 100× less parameters. On Pick-a-Pic v2, PAL is 2.5% more accurate than the best method with 156× fewer learned parameters. Finally, we provide theoretical analysis for generalization of rewards learned via PAL framework showcasing the reduction in number of samples needed per user."
Poster,Palu: KV-Cache Compression with Low-Rank Projection,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29993,"Chi-Chih Chang, Wei-Cheng Lin, Chien-Yu Lin, Chong-Yan Chen, Yu-Fang Hu, Pei-Shuo Wang, Ning-Chi Huang, Luis Ceze, Mohamed Abdelfattah, Kai-Chiang Wu","Post-training KV-Cache compression methods typically either sample a subset of effectual tokens or quantize the data into lower numerical bit width. However, these methods cannot exploit redundancy in the hidden dimension of the KV tenors. This paper presents a hidden dimension compression approach called Palu, a KV-Cache compression framework that utilizes low-rank projection to reduce inference-time LLM memory usage. Palu decomposes the linear layers into low-rank matrices, caches compressed intermediate states, and reconstructs the full keys and values on the fly. To improve accuracy, compression rate, and efficiency, Palu further encompasses (1) a medium-grained low-rank decomposition scheme, (2) an efficient rank search algorithm, (3) low-rank-aware quantization compatibility enhancements, and (4) an optimized GPU kernel with matrix fusion. Extensive experiments with popular LLMs show that Palu compresses KV-Cache by 50% while maintaining strong accuracy and delivering up to 1.89× speedup on the RoPE-based attention module. When combined with quantization, Palu’sinherent quantization-friendly design yields small to negligible extra accuracy degradation while saving additional memory than quantization-only methods and achieving up to 2.91× speedup for the RoPE-based attention. Moreover, it maintains comparable or even better accuracy (up to 1.19 lower perplexity) compared to quantization-only methods. These results demonstrate Palu’s superior capability to effectively address the efficiency and memory challenges of LLM inference posed by KV-Cache.

Poster,Pangea: A Fully Open Multilingual Multimodal LLM for 39 Languages,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29188,"Xiang Yue, Yueqi Song, Akari Asai, Seungone Kim, JEAN NYANDWI, Simran Khanuja, Anjali Kantharuban, Lintang Sutawika, Sathyanarayanan Ramamoorthy, Graham Neubig","Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their development has predominantly focused on English- and western-centric datasets and tasks, leaving most of the world's languages and diverse cultural contexts underrepresented.  This paper introduces PANGEA, a multilingual multimodal LLM trained on PANGEAINS, a diverse 6M instruction dataset spanning 39 languages. PANGEAINS features: 1) high-quality English instructions, 2) carefully machine-translated instructions, and 3) culturally relevant multimodal tasks to ensure cross-cultural coverage. To rigorously assess models' capabilities, we introduce PANGEABENCH, a holistic evaluation suite encompassing 14 datasets covering 47 languages. Results show that PANGEA significantly outperforms existing open-source models in multilingual settings and diverse cultural contexts. Ablation studies further reveal the importance of English data proportions, language popularity, and the number of multimodal training samples on overall performance.  We fully open-source our data, code, and trained checkpoints, to facilitate the development of inclusive and robust multilingual MLLMs, promoting equity and accessibility across a broader linguistic and cultural spectrum."
Poster,PaPaGei: Open Foundation Models for Optical Physiological Signals,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28573,"Arvind Pillai, Dimitris Spathis, Fahim Kawsar, Mohammad Malekzadeh","Photoplethysmography (PPG) is the leading non-invasive technique for monitoring biosignals and cardiovascular health, with widespread adoption in both clinical settings and consumer wearable devices. While machine learning models trained on PPG signals have shown promise, they tend to be task-specific and struggle with generalization. Current research is limited by the use of single-device datasets, insufficient exploration of out-of-domain generalization, and a lack of publicly available models, which hampers reproducibility. To address these limitations, we present PaPaGei, the first open foundation model for PPG signals. The model is pre-trained on over 57,000 hours of data, comprising 20 million unlabeled PPG segments from publicly available datasets. We introduce a novel representation learning approach that leverages domain knowledge of PPG signal morphology across individuals, enabling the capture of richer representations compared to traditional contrastive learning methods. We evaluate PaPaGei against state-of-the-art time-series foundation models and self-supervised learning benchmarks across 20 tasks from 10 diverse datasets, spanning cardiovascular health, sleep disorders, pregnancy monitoring, and wellbeing assessment. Our model demonstrates superior performance, improving classification and regression metrics by 6.3% and 2.9% respectively in at least 14 tasks. Notably, PaPaGei achieves these results while being more data- and parameter-efficient, outperforming models that are 70x larger. Beyond accuracy, we examine model robustness across different skin tones, establishing a benchmark for bias evaluation in future models. PaPaGei can serve as both a feature extractor and an encoder for multimodal models, opening up new opportunities for multimodal health monitoring.

Poster,Param$\Delta$ for Direct Mixing: Post-Train Large Language Model At Zero Cost,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27886,"Sheng Cao, Mingrui Wu, Karthik Prasad, Yuandong Tian, Zechun Liu","The post-training phase of large language models is essential for enhancing capabilities such as instruction-following, reasoning, and alignment with human preferences. However, it demands extensive high-quality data and poses risks like overfitting, alongside significant computational costs due to repeated post-training and evaluation after each base model update. This paper introduces Param$\Delta$, a novel method that streamlines post-training by transferring knowledge from an existing post-trained model to a newly updated base model with \textbf{zero} additional training. By computing the difference between post-trained model weights ($\Theta_\text{post}$) and base model weights ($\Theta_\text{base}$), and adding this to the updated base model ($\Theta_\text{base}'$), we define Param$\Delta$ Model as: $\Theta_{\text{Param}\Delta} = \Theta_\text{post} - \Theta_\text{base} + \Theta_\text{base}'$. This approach surprisingly equips the new base model with post-trained capabilities, achieving performance comparable to direct post-training. We did analysis on LLama3, Llama3.1, Qwen, and DeepSeek-distilled models. Results indicate Param$\Delta$ Model effectively replicates traditional post-training. For example, the Param$\Delta$ Model obtained from 70B Llama3-inst, Llama3-base, Llama3.1-base models attains approximately 95\% of Llama3.1-inst model's performance on average. Param$\Delta$ brings a new perspective on how to fully leverage models in the open-weight community, where checkpoints for base and instruct models are readily available and frequently updated, by providing a cost-free framework to accelerate the iterative cycle of model development."
Poster,Parameter and Memory Efficient Pretraining via Low-rank Riemannian Optimization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28725,"Zhanfeng Mo, Long-Kai Huang, Sinno Jialin Pan","Pretraining large language models often requires significant computational resources and memory due to their vast parameter amount. An effective approach to enhance parameter efficiency in both training and inference is to parameterize each full-size weight as the product of two trainable low-rank factors. While low-rank fine-tuning has achieved great success, low-rank pretraining remains challenging as it requires learning extensive knowledge from scratch under the restrictive low-rank parameterization. During standard low-rank pretraining, separately optimizing the low-rank factors introduces redundant information from the full gradient, which hinders the learning process. To achieve efficient yet effective low-rank pretraining, we propose a **Lo**w-rank **R**iemannian **O**ptimizer (**LORO**). At each LORO update step, the low-rank factor pairs are jointly updated to ensure their full-size product moves along the steepest descent direction on the low-rank manifold, without the need to compute any memory-intensive full-size matrices or gradients. Hence, our LORO finds low-rank models that achieve high performance comparable to full-size pretrained models, while significantly reducing memory usage and accelerating both training and inference. A LLaMA 1B model pretrained with LORO achieves a perplexity score of 2\% better than the full-size baseline, with a 54\% reduction in model memory, a $\times1.8$ speedup in training, and a $\times2.2$ speedup in inference. The code is available on https://github.com/mzf666/LORO-main."
Poster,Parameter Expanded Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28902,"Hyunsu Kim, Giung Nam, Chulhee Yun, Hongseok Yang, Juho Lee","Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide a promising framework for modeling predictive uncertainty and enhancing out-of-distribution robustness (OOD) by estimating the posterior distribution of network parameters. Stochastic Gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SGMCMC) is one of the most powerful methods for scalable posterior sampling in BNNs, achieving efficiency by combining stochastic gradient descent with second-order Langevin dynamics. However, SGMCMC often suffers from limited sample diversity in practice, which affects uncertainty estimation and model performance. We propose a simple yet effective approach to enhance sample diversity in SGMCMC without the need for tempering or running multiple chains. Our approach reparameterizes the neural network by decomposing each of its weight matrices into a product of matrices, resulting in a sampling trajectory that better explores the target parameter space. This approach produces a more diverse set of samples, allowing faster mixing within the same computational budget. Notably, our sampler achieves these improvements without increasing the inference cost compared to the standard SGMCMC. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks, including OOD robustness, diversity, loss surface analyses, and a comparative study with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach."
Poster,PaRa: Personalizing Text-to-Image Diffusion via Parameter Rank Reduction,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30047,"Shangyu Chen, Zizheng Pan, Jianfei Cai, Dinh Phung","Personalizing a large-scale pretrained Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model is chal-lenging as it typically struggles to make an appropriate trade-off between its trainingdata distribution and the target distribution, i.e., learning a novel concept with only afew target images to achieve personalization (aligning with the personalized target)while preserving text editability (aligning with diverse text prompts). In this paper,we propose PaRa, an effective and efficient Parameter Rank Reduction approachfor T2I model personalization by explicitly controlling the rank of the diffusionmodel parameters to restrict its initial diverse generation space into a small andwell-balanced target space. Our design is motivated by the fact that taming a T2Imodel toward a novel concept such as a specific art style implies a small generationspace. To this end, by reducing the rank of model parameters during finetuning, wecan effectively constrain the space of the denoising sampling trajectories towardsthe target. With comprehensive experiments, we show that PaRa achieves greatadvantages over existing finetuning approaches on single/multi-subject generationas well as single-image editing. Notably, compared to the prevailing fine-tuningtechnique LoRA, PaRa achieves better parameter efficiency (2× fewer learnableparameters) and much better target image alignment."
Poster,ParaSolver: A Hierarchical Parallel Integral Solver for Diffusion Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31147,"Jianrong Lu, Zhiyu Zhu, Junhui Hou","This paper explores the challenge of accelerating the sequential inference process of Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs). We tackle this critical issue from a dynamic systems perspective, in which the inherent sequential nature is transformed into a parallel sampling process. Specifically, we propose a unified framework that generalizes the sequential sampling process of DPMs as solving a system of banded nonlinear equations. Under this generic framework, we reveal that the Jacobian of the banded nonlinear equations system possesses a unit-diagonal structure, enabling further approximation for acceleration. Moreover, we theoretically propose an effective initialization approach for parallel sampling methods. Finally, we construct \textit{ParaSolver}, a hierarchical parallel sampling technique that enhances sampling speed without compromising quality. Extensive experiments show that ParaSolver achieves up to \textbf{12.1× speedup} in terms of wall-clock time. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/Jianrong-Lu/ParaSolver.git."
