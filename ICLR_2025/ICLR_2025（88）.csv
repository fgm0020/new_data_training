Poster,Diffusion On Syntax Trees For Program Synthesis,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27850,"Shreyas Kapur, Erik Jenner, Stuart Russell","Large language models generate code one token at a time. Their autoregressive generation process lacks the feedback of observing the program's output. Training LLMs to suggest edits directly can be challenging due to the scarcity of rich edit data. To address these problems, we propose neural diffusion models that operate on syntax trees of any context-free grammar. Similar to image diffusion models, our method also inverts ""noise"" applied to syntax trees. Rather than generating code sequentially, we iteratively edit it while preserving syntactic validity, which makes it easy to combine this neural model with search. We apply our approach to inverse graphics tasks, where our model learns to convert images into programs that produce those images. Combined with search, our model is able to write graphics programs, see the execution result, and debug them to meet the required specifications. We additionally show how our system can write graphics programs for hand-drawn sketches. Video results can be found at https://tree-diffusion.github.io."
Poster,Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28475,"Allen Ren, Justin Lidard, Lars Ankile, Anthony Simeonov, Pulkit Agrawal, Anirudha Majumdar, Benjamin Burchfiel, Hongkai Dai, Max Simchowitz","We introduce Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization, DPPO, an algorithmic framework including best practices for fine-tuning diffusion-based policies (e.g. Diffusion Policy) in continuous control and robot learning tasks using the policy gradient (PG) method from reinforcement learning (RL). PG methods are ubiquitous in training RL policies with other policy parameterizations; nevertheless, they had been conjectured to be less efficient for diffusion-based policies. Surprisingly, we show that DPPO achieves the strongest overall performance and efficiency for fine-tuning in common benchmarks compared to other RL methods for diffusion-based policies and also compared to PG fine-tuning of other policy parameterizations. Through experimental investigation, we find that DPPO takes advantage of unique synergies between RL fine-tuning and the diffusion parameterization, leading to structured and on-manifold exploration, stable training, and strong policy robustness. We further demonstrate the strengths of DPPO in a range of realistic settings, including simulated robotic tasks with pixel observations, and via zero-shot deployment of simulation-trained policies on robot hardware in a long-horizon, multi-stage manipulation task."
Poster,Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient for Inverse Problems,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28584,"Rayhan Zirvi, Bahareh Tolooshams, anima anandkumar","Recent advancements in diffusion models have been effective in learning data priors for solving inverse problems. They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.

Poster,Diffusion Transformer Captures Spatial-Temporal Dependencies: A Theory for Gaussian Process Data,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29925,"Hengyu Fu, Zehao Dou, Jiawei Guo, Mengdi Wang, Minshuo Chen","Diffusion Transformer, the backbone of Sora for video generation, successfully scales the capacity of diffusion models, pioneering new avenues for high-fidelity sequential data generation. Unlike static data such as images, sequential data consists of consecutive data frames indexed by time, exhibiting rich spatial and temporal dependencies. These dependencies represent the underlying dynamic model and are critical to validate the generated data. In this paper, we make the first theoretical step towards bridging diffusion transformers for capturing spatial-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we establish score approximation and distribution estimation guarantees of diffusion transformers for learning Gaussian process data with covariance functions of various decay patterns. We highlight how the spatial-temporal dependencies are captured and affect learning efficiency. Our study proposes a novel transformer approximation theory, where the transformer acts to unroll an algorithm. We support our theoretical results by numerical experiments, providing strong evidence that spatial-temporal dependencies are captured within attention layers, aligning with our approximation theory."
Poster,Diffusion Transformers for Tabular Data Time Series Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29095,"Fabrizio Garuti, Enver Sangineto, Simone Luetto, Lorenzo Forni, Rita Cucchiara","Tabular data generation has recently attracted a growing interest due to its different application scenarios. However, generating time series of tabular data, where each element of the series depends on the others,remains a largely unexplored domain. This gap is probably due to the difficulty of jointly solving different problems, the main of which are the heterogeneity of tabular data (a problem common to non-time-dependent approaches) and the variable length of a time series.In this paper, we propose a Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) based approach for tabular data series generation. Inspired by the recent success of DiTs in image and video generation, we extend this framework to deal with heterogeneous data and variable-length sequences. Using extensive experiments on six datasets, we show that the proposed approach  outperforms previous work by a large margin."
Poster,Digi-Q: Learning VLM Q-Value Functions for Training Device-Control Agents,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30502,"Hao Bai, Yifei Zhou, Li Li, Sergey Levine, Aviral Kumar","While a number of existing approaches for building foundation model agents rely on prompting or fine-tuning with human demonstrations, it is not sufficient in dynamic environments (e.g., mobile device control). On-policy reinforcement learning (RL) should address these limitations, but collecting actual rollouts in an environment is often undesirable in truly open-ended agentic problems such as mobile device control or interacting with humans, where each unit of interaction is associated with a cost. In such scenarios, a method for policy learning that can utilize off-policy experience by learning a trained action-value function is much more effective. In this paper, we develop an approach, called Digi-Q, to train VLM-based action-value Q-functions which are then used to extract the agent policy. We study our approach in the mobile device control setting. Digi-Q trains the Q-function using offline temporal-difference (TD) learning, on top of frozen, intermediate-layer features of a VLM. Compared to fine-tuning the whole VLM, this approach saves us compute and enhances scalability. To make the VLM features amenable for representing the Q-function, we need to employ an initial phase of fine-tuning to amplify coverage over actionable information needed for value function. Once trained, we use this Q-function via a Best-of-N policy extraction operator that imitates the best action out of multiple candidate actions from the current policy as ranked by the value function, enabling policy improvement without environment interaction. Digi-Q outperforms several prior methods on user-scale device control tasks in Android-in-the-Wild, attaining 21.2% improvement over prior best-performing method. In some cases, our Digi-Q ap-proach already matches state-of-the-art RL methods that require interaction. The project is open-sourced at https://github.com/DigiRL-agent/digiq"
Poster,Dimension Agnostic Neural Processes,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27989,"Hyungi Lee, Chaeyun Jang, Dong Bok Lee, Juho Lee","Meta-learning aims to train models that can generalize to new tasks with limited labeled data by extracting shared features across diverse task datasets. Additionally, it accounts for prediction uncertainty during both training and evaluation, a concept known as uncertainty-aware meta-learning. Neural Process (NP) is a well-known uncertainty-aware meta-learning method that constructs implicit stochastic processes using parametric neural networks, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks. However, existing NP methods face challenges in accommodating diverse input dimensions and learned features, limiting their broad applicability across regression tasks. To address these limitations and advance the utility of NP models as general regressors, we introduce Dimension Agnostic Neural Process (DANP). DANP incorporates Dimension Aggregator Block (DAB) to transform input features into a fixed-dimensional space, enhancing the model's ability to handle diverse datasets. Furthermore, leveraging the Transformer architecture and latent encoding layers, DANP learns a wider range of features that are generalizable across various tasks. Through comprehensive experimentation on various synthetic and practical regression tasks, we empirically show that DANP outperforms previous NP variations, showcasing its effectiveness in overcoming the limitations of traditional NP models and its potential for broader applicability in diverse regression scenarios."
Poster,DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31510,"Pierre Fernandez, Piotr Bojanowski, Gabriel Synnaeve, Marc Szafraniec, Maxime Oquab, Armand Joulin, Hu Xu, Wojciech Galuba, Vasu Sharma, Timothée Darcet, Michael Rabbat, Russell Howes, Ishan Misra, Shang-Wen Li, Mahmoud Assran, Alaaeldin Ali, Herve Jegou, Po-Yao Huang, Nicolas Ballas, Théo Moutakanni, Huy Vo, Vasil Khalidov, Daniel HAZIZA, Francisco Massa, Patrick Labatut, Julien Mairal","The recent breakthroughs in natural language processing for model pretraining on large quantities of data have opened the way for similar foundation models in computer vision. These models could greatly simplify the use of images in any system by producing all-purpose visual features, i.e., features that work across image distributions and tasks without finetuning. This work shows that existing pretraining methods, especially self-supervised methods, can produce such features if trained on enough curated data from diverse sources. We revisit existing approaches and combine different techniques to scale our pretraining in terms of data and model size. Most of the technical contributions aim at accelerating and stabilizing the training at scale. In terms of data, we propose an automatic pipeline to build a dedicated, diverse, and curated image dataset instead of uncurated data, as typically done in the self-supervised literature. In terms of models, we train a ViT model with 1B parameters and distill it into a series of smaller models that surpass the best available all-purpose features, OpenCLIP on most of the benchmarks at image and pixel levels."
Poster,Direct Distributional Optimization for Provable Alignment of Diffusion Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29849,"Ryotaro Kawata, Kazusato Oko, Atsushi Nitanda, Taiji Suzuki","We introduce a novel alignment method for diffusion models from distribution optimization perspectives while providing rigorous convergence guarantees.We first formulate the problem as a generic regularized loss minimization over probability distributions and directly optimize the distribution using the Dual Averaging method.Next, we enable sampling from the learned distribution by approximating its score function via Doob's $h$-transform technique.The proposed framework is supported by rigorous convergence guarantees and an end-to-end bound on the sampling error, which imply that when the original distribution's score is known accurately, the complexity of sampling from shifted distributions is independent of isoperimetric conditions.This framework is broadly applicable to general distribution optimization problems, including alignment tasks in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO). We empirically validate its performance on synthetic and image datasets using the DPO objective."
Poster,Directional Gradient Projection for Robust Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28802,"Chengyue Huang, Junjiao Tian, Brisa Maneechotesuwan, Shivang Chopra, Zsolt Kira","Robust fine-tuning aims to adapt large foundation models to downstream tasks while preserving their robustness to distribution shifts. Existing methods primarily focus on constraining and projecting current model towards the pre-trained initialization based on the magnitudes between fine-tuned and pre-trained weights, which often require extensive hyper-parameter tuning and can sometimes result in underfitting. In this work, we propose $\textbf{Di}$rectional $\textbf{Gra}$dient $\textbf{P}$rojection (DiGraP), a novel layer-wise trainable method that incorporates directional information from gradients to bridge regularization and multi-objective optimization. Besides demonstrating our method on image classification, as another contribution we generalize this area to the multi-modal evaluation settings for robust fine-tuning. Specifically, we first bridge the uni-modal and multi-modal gap by performing analysis on Image Classification reformulated Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks and further categorize ten out-of-distribution (OOD) VQA datasets by distribution shift types and degree (i.e. near versus far OOD). Experimental results show that DiGraP consistently outperforms existing baselines across Image Classfication and VQA tasks with discriminative and generative backbones, improving both in-distribution (ID) generalization and OOD robustness."
