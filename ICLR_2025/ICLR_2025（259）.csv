Poster,PharmacoMatch: Efficient 3D Pharmacophore Screening via Neural Subgraph Matching,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31161,"Daniel Rose, Oliver Wieder, Thomas Seidel, Thierry Langer","The increasing size of screening libraries poses a significant challenge for the development of virtual screening methods for drug discovery, necessitating a re-evaluation of traditional approaches in the era of big data. Although 3D pharmacophore screening remains a prevalent technique, its application to very large datasets is limited by the computational cost associated with matching query pharmacophores to database molecules. In this study, we introduce PharmacoMatch, a novel contrastive learning approach based on neural subgraph matching. Our method reinterprets pharmacophore screening as an approximate subgraph matching problem and enables efficient querying of conformational databases by encoding query-target relationships in the embedding space. We conduct comprehensive investigations of the learned representations and evaluate PharmacoMatch as pre-screening tool in a zero-shot setting. We demonstrate significantly shorter runtimes and comparable performance metrics to existing solutions, providing a promising speed-up for screening very large datasets."
Poster,"Phidias: A Generative Model for Creating 3D  Content from Text, Image, and 3D Conditions with Reference-Augmented  Diffusion",https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29554,"zhenwei Wang, Tengfei Wang, Zexin He, Gerhard Hancke, Ziwei Liu, Rynson W Lau","Generative 3D modeling has made significant advances recently, but it remains constrained by its inherently ill-posed nature, leading to challenges in quality and controllability. Inspired by the real-world workflow that designers typically refer to existing 3D models when creating new ones, we propose Phidias, a novel generative model that uses diffusion for reference-augmented 3D generation. Given an image, our method leverages a retrieved or user-provided 3D reference model to guide the generation process, thereby enhancing the generation quality, generalization ability, and controllability. Phidias integrates three key components: 1) meta-ControlNet to dynamically modulate the conditioning strength, 2) dynamic reference routing to mitigate misalignment between the input image and 3D reference, and 3) self-reference augmentations to enable self-supervised training with a progressive curriculum.  Collectively, these designs result in significant generative improvements over existing methods. Phidias forms a unified framework for 3D generation using text, image, and 3D conditions, offering versatile applications."
Poster,PhiNets: Brain-inspired Non-contrastive Learning Based on Temporal Prediction Hypothesis,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30926,"Satoki Ishikawa, Makoto Yamada, Han Bao, Yuki Takezawa","Predictive coding has been established as a promising neuroscientific theory to describe the mechanism of information processing in the retina or cortex.This theory hypothesises that cortex predicts sensory inputs at various levels of abstraction to minimise prediction errors.  Inspired by predictive coding, Chen et al. (2024) proposed another theory, temporal prediction hypothesis, to claim that sequence memory residing in hippocampus has emerged through predicting input signals from the past sensory inputs.  Specifically, they supposed that the CA3 predictor in hippocampus creates synaptic delay between input signals, which is compensated by the following CA1 predictor.  Though recorded neural activities were replicated based on the temporal prediction hypothesis, its validity has not been fully explored.  In this work, we aim to explore the temporal prediction hypothesis from the perspective of self-supervised learning (SSL).  Specifically, we focus on non-contrastive learning, which generates two augmented views of an input image and predicts one from another.  Non-contrastive learning is intimately related to the temporal prediction hypothesis because the synaptic delay is implicitly created by StopGradient.  Building upon a popular non-contrastive learner, SimSiam, we propose PhiNet, an extension of SimSiam to have two predictors explicitly corresponding to the CA3 and CA1, respectively.  Through studying the PhiNet model, we discover two findings.  First, meaningful data representations emerge in PhiNet more stably than in SimSiam.  This is initially supported by our learning dynamics analysis: PhiNet is more robust to the representational collapse.  Second, PhiNet adapts more quickly to newly incoming patterns in online and continual learning scenarios.  For practitioners, we additionally propose an extension called X-PhiNet integrated with a momentum encoder, excelling in continual learning.  All in all, our work reveals that the temporal prediction hypothesis is a reasonable model in terms of the robustness and adaptivity."
Poster,PhyloLM: Inferring the Phylogeny of Large Language Models and Predicting their Performances in Benchmarks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28195,"Nicolas Yax, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer, Stefano Palminteri","This paper introduces PhyloLM, a method adapting phylogenetic algorithms to Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore whether and how they relate to each other and to predict their performance characteristics. Our method calculates a phylogenetic distance metric based on the similarity of LLMs' output. The resulting metric is then used to construct dendrograms, which satisfactorily capture  known relationships across a set of 111 open-source and 45 closed models. Furthermore, our phylogenetic distance predicts performance in standard benchmarks, thus demonstrating its functional validity and paving the way for  a time and cost-effective estimation of LLM capabilities. To sum up, by translating population genetic concepts to machine learning, we propose and validate a tool to evaluate LLM development,  relationships and capabilities, even in the absence of transparent training information."
Poster,PhyloVAE: Unsupervised Learning of Phylogenetic Trees via Variational Autoencoders,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29234,"Tianyu Xie, David Harry Tyensoung Richman, Jiansi Gao, Frederick A Matsen, Cheng Zhang","Learning informative representations of phylogenetic tree structures is essential for analyzing evolutionary relationships. Classical distance-based methods have been widely used to project phylogenetic trees into Euclidean space, but they are often sensitive to the choice of distance metric and may lack sufficient resolution. In this paper, we introduce *phylogenetic variational autoencoders* (PhyloVAEs), an unsupervised learning framework designed for representation learning and generative modeling of tree topologies. Leveraging an efficient encoding mechanism inspired by autoregressive tree topology generation, we develop a deep latent-variable generative model that facilitates fast, parallelized topology generation. PhyloVAE combines this generative model with a collaborative inference model based on learnable topological features, allowing for high-resolution representations of phylogenetic tree samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate PhyloVAE's robust representation learning capabilities and fast generation of phylogenetic tree topologies."
Poster,PhyMPGN: Physics-encoded Message Passing Graph Network for spatiotemporal PDE systems,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28878,"Bocheng Zeng, Qi Wang, Mengtao Yan, Yang Liu, Ruizhi Chengze, Yi Zhang, Hongsheng Liu, Zidong Wang, Hao Sun","Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) serves as a cornerstone for modeling complex dynamical systems. Recent progresses have demonstrated grand benefits of data-driven neural-based models for predicting spatiotemporal dynamics (e.g., tremendous speedup gain compared with classical numerical methods). However, most existing neural models rely on rich training data, have limited extrapolation and generalization abilities, and suffer to produce precise or reliable physical prediction under intricate conditions (e.g., irregular mesh or geometry, complex boundary conditions, diverse PDE parameters, etc.). To this end, we propose a new graph learning approach, namely, Physics-encoded Message Passing Graph Network (PhyMPGN), to model spatiotemporal PDE systems on irregular meshes given small training datasets. Specifically, we incorporate a GNN into a numerical integrator to approximate the temporal marching of spatiotemporal dynamics for a given PDE system. Considering that many physical phenomena are governed by diffusion processes, we further design a learnable Laplace block, which encodes the discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator, to aid and guide the GNN learning in a physically feasible solution space. A boundary condition padding strategy is also designed to improve the model convergence and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhyMPGN is capable of accurately predicting various types of spatiotemporal dynamics on coarse unstructured meshes, consistently achieves the state-of-the-art results, and outperforms other baselines with considerable gains."
Poster,PhysBench: Benchmarking and Enhancing Vision-Language Models for Physical World Understanding,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/32088,"Wei Chow, Jiageng Mao, Boyi Li, Daniel Seita, Vitor Campagnolo Guizilini, Yue Wang","Understanding the physical world is a fundamental challenge in embodied AI, critical for enabling agents to perform complex tasks and operate safely in real-world environments. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited.To close this gap, we introduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' physical world understanding capability across a diverse set of tasks. PhysBench contains 10,002 entries of interleaved video-image-text data, categorized into four major domains: physical object properties, physical object relationships, physical scene understanding, and physics-based dynamics, further divided into 19 subclasses and 8 distinct capability dimensions.Our extensive experiments, conducted on 75 representative VLMs, reveal that while these models excel in common-sense reasoning, they struggle with understanding the physical world---likely due to the absence of physical knowledge in their training data and the lack of embedded physical priors.To tackle the shortfall, we introduce PhysAgent, a novel framework that combines the generalization strengths of VLMs with the specialized expertise of vision models, significantly enhancing VLMs' physical understanding across a variety of tasks, including an 18.4\% improvement on GPT-4o.Furthermore, our results demonstrate that enhancing VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can help embodied agents such as MOKA.We believe that PhysBench and PhysAgent offer valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between VLMs and physical world understanding.

Poster,Physics-aligned field reconstruction with diffusion bridge,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30484,"Zeyu Li, Hongkun Dou, Shen Fang, Wang Han, Yue Deng, Lijun Yang","The reconstruction of physical fields from sparse measurements is pivotal in both scientific research and engineering applications. Traditional methods are increasingly supplemented by deep learning models due to their efficacy in extracting features from data. However, except for the low accuracy on complex physical systems, these models often fail to comply with essential physical constraints, such as governing equations and boundary conditions. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel data-driven field reconstruction framework, termed the Physics-aligned Schr\""{o}dinger Bridge (PalSB). This framework leverages a diffusion bridge mechanism that is specifically tailored to align with physical constraints. The PalSB approach incorporates a dual-stage training process designed to address both local reconstruction mapping and global physical principles. Additionally, a boundary-aware sampling technique is implemented to ensure adherence to physical boundary conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PalSB through its application to three complex nonlinear systems: cylinder flow from Particle Image Velocimetry experiments, two-dimensional turbulence, and a reaction-diffusion system. The results reveal that PalSB not only achieves higher accuracy but also exhibits enhanced compliance with physical constraints compared to existing methods. This highlights PalSB's capability to generate high-quality representations of intricate physical interactions, showcasing its potential for advancing field reconstruction techniques.

Poster,Physics-Informed Deep Inverse Operator Networks for Solving PDE Inverse Problems,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31262,"Sung Woong Cho, Hwijae Son","Inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) can be seen as discovering a mapping from measurement data to unknown quantities, often framed within an operator learning approach. However, existing methods typically rely on large amounts of labeled training data, which is impractical for most real-world applications. Moreover, these supervised models may fail to capture the underlying physical principles accurately. To address these limitations, we propose a novel architecture called Physics-Informed Deep Inverse Operator Networks (PI-DIONs), which can learn the solution operator of PDE-based inverse problems without any labeled training data. We extend the stability estimates established in the inverse problem literature to the operator learning framework, thereby providing a robust theoretical foundation for our method. These estimates guarantee that the proposed model, trained on a finite sample and grid, generalizes effectively across the entire domain and function space. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that PI-DIONs can effectively and accurately learn the solution operators of the inverse problems without the need for labeled data."
Poster,Physics-Informed Diffusion Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28020,"Jan-Hendrik Bastek, WaiChing Sun, Dennis Kochmann","Generative models such as denoising diffusion models are quickly advancing their ability to approximate highly complex data distributions. They are also increasingly leveraged in scientific machine learning, where samples from the implied data distribution are expected to adhere to specific governing equations. We present a framework that unifies generative modeling and partial differential equation fulfillment by introducing a first-principle-based loss term that enforces generated samples to fulfill the underlying physical constraints. Our approach reduces the residual error by up to two orders of magnitudes compared to previous work in a fluid flow case study and outperforms task-specific frameworks in relevant metrics for structural topology optimization. We also present numerical evidence that our extended training objective acts as a natural regularization mechanism against overfitting. Our framework is simple to implement and versatile in its applicability for imposing equality and inequality constraints as well as auxiliary optimization objectives.
