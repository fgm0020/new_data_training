Poster,Retrieval Augmented Diffusion Model for Structure-informed Antibody Design and Optimization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29186,"Zichen Wang, Yaokun Ji, Jianing Tian, Shuangjia Zheng","Antibodies are essential proteins responsible for immune responses in organisms, capable of specifically recognizing antigen molecules of pathogens. Recent advances in generative models have significantly enhanced rational antibody design. However, existing methods mainly create antibodies from scratch without template constraints, leading to model optimization challenges and unnatural sequences. To address these issues, we propose a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework, termed RADAb, for efficient antibody design. Our method leverages a set of structural homologous motifs that align with query structural constraints to guide the generative model in inversely optimizing antibodies according to desired design criteria. Specifically, we introduce a structure-informed retrieval mechanism that integrates these exemplar motifs with the input backbone through a novel dual-branch denoising module, utilizing both structural and evolutionary information. Additionally, we develop a conditional diffusion model that iteratively refines the optimization process by incorporating both global context and local evolutionary conditions. Our approach is agnostic to the choice of generative models. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple antibody inverse folding and optimization tasks, offering a new perspective on biomolecular generative models."
Poster,Retrieval Head Mechanistically Explains Long-Context Factuality,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30373,"Wenhao Wu, Yizhong Wang, Guangxuan Xiao, Hao Peng, Yao Fu","Despite the recent progress in long-context language models, it remains elusive how transformer-based models exhibit the capability to retrieve relevant information from arbitrary locations within the long context. This paper aims to address this question. Our systematic investigation across a wide spectrum of models reveals that a special type of attention heads are largely responsible for retrieving information, which we dub retrieval heads. We identify intriguing properties of retrieval heads:(1) universal: all the explored models with long-context capability have a set of retrieval heads; (2) sparse: only a small portion (less than 5\%) of the attention heads are retrieval. (3) intrinsic: retrieval heads already exist in models pretrained with short context. When extending the context length by continual pretraining, it is still the same set of heads that perform information retrieval. (4) dynamically activated: take Llama-2 7B for example, 12 retrieval heads always attend to the required information no matter how the context is changed. The rest of the retrieval heads are activated in different contexts. (5) causal: completely pruning retrieval heads leads to failure in retrieving relevant information and results in hallucination, while pruning random non-retrieval heads does not affect the model's retrieval ability. We further show that retrieval heads strongly influence chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, where the model needs to frequently refer back the question and previously-generated context. Conversely, tasks where the model directly generates the answer using its intrinsic knowledge are less impacted by masking out retrieval heads. These observations collectively explain which internal part of the model seeks information from the input tokens. We believe our insights will foster future research on reducing hallucination, improving reasoning, and compressing the KV cache."
Poster,RetroInText: A Multimodal Large Language Model Enhanced Framework for Retrosynthetic Planning via In-Context Representation Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30129,"Chenglong Kang, Xiaoyi Liu, Fei Guo","Development of robust and effective strategies for retrosynthetic planning requires a deep understanding of the synthesis process. A critical step in achieving this goal is accurately identifying synthetic intermediates. Current machine learning-based methods often overlook the valuable context from the overall route, focusing only on predicting reactants from the product, requiring cost annotations for every reaction step, and ignoring the multi-faced nature of molecular, resulting in inaccurate synthetic route predictions. Therefore, we introduce RetroInText, an advanced end-to-end framework based on a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), featuring in-context learning with TEXT descriptions of synthetic routes. First, RetroInText including ChatGPT presents detailed descriptions of the reaction procedure. It learns the distinct compound representations in parallel with corresponding molecule encoders to extract multi-modal representations including 3D features. Subsequently, we propose an attention-based mechanism that offers a fusion module to complement these multi-modal representations with in-context learning and a fine-tuned language model for a single-step model. As a result, RetroInText accurately represents and effectively captures the complex relationship between molecules and the synthetic route. In experiments on the USPTO pathways dataset RetroBench, RetroInText outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 5% improvement in Top-1 test accuracy, particularly for long synthetic routes. These results demonstrate the superiority of RetroInText by integrating with context information over routes. They also demonstrate its potential for advancing pathway design and facilitating the development of organic chemistry. Code is available at https://github.com/guofei-tju/RetroInText."
Poster,Revealing and Mitigating Over-Attention in Knowledge Editing,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30995,"Pinzheng Wang, Zecheng Tang, Keyan Zhou, Juntao Li, Qiaoming Zhu, Min Zhang","Large Language Models~(LLMs) have demonstrated superior performance across a wide range of tasks, but they still exhibit undesirable errors due to incorrect knowledge learned from the training data. To avoid this, knowledge editing methods emerged to precisely edit the specific model knowledge via efficiently modifying a very small percentage of parameters. However, those methods can lead to the problem of **Specificity Failure**, where the existing knowledge and capabilities are severely degraded due to editing.Our preliminary indicates that Specificity Failure primarily stems from the model's attention heads assigning excessive attention scores to entities related to the edited knowledge, thereby unduly focusing on specific snippets within the context, which we denote as the **Attention Drift** phenomenon.To mitigate such Attention Drift issue, we introduce a simple yet effective method **S**elective **A**ttention **D**rift **R**estriction(**SADR**), which introduces an additional regularization term during the knowledge editing process to restrict changes in the attention weight distribution, thereby preventing undue focus on the edited entity.Experiments on five frequently-used strong LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where SADR can significantly mitigate Specificity Failure in the predominant knowledge editing tasks."
Poster,Revealing and Reducing Gender Biases in Vision and Language Assistants (VLAs),https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28356,"Leander Girrbach, Stephan Alaniz, Yiran Huang, trevor darrell, Zeynep Akata","Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have been reliably integrated with visual input for multimodal tasks. The widespread adoption of instruction-tuned image-to-text vision-language assistants (VLAs) like LLaVA and InternVL necessitates evaluating gender biases. We study gender bias in 22 popular open-source VLAs with respect to personality traits, skills, and occupations. Our results show that VLAs replicate human biases likely present in the data, such as real-world occupational imbalances. Similarly, they tend to attribute more skills and positive personality traits to women than to men, and we see a consistent tendency to associate negative personality traits with men. To eliminate the gender bias in these models, we find that fine-tuning-based debiasing methods achieve the best trade-off between debiasing and retaining performance on downstream tasks. We argue for pre-deploying gender bias assessment in VLAs and motivate further development of debiasing strategies to ensure equitable societal outcomes.

Poster,Revealing the 3D Cosmic Web through Gravitationally Constrained Neural Fields,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30603,"Brandon Zhao, Aviad Levis, Liam Connor, Pratul Srinivasan, Katherine Bouman","Weak gravitational lensing is the slight distortion of galaxy shapes caused primarily by the gravitational effects of dark matter in the universe. In our work, we seek to invert the weak lensing signal from 2D telescope images to reconstruct a 3D map of the universe’s dark matter field. While inversion typically yeilds a 2D projection of the dark matter field, accurate 3D maps of the dark matter distribution are essential for localizing structures of interest and testing theories of our universe. However, 3D inversion poses signficant challenges. First, unlike standard 3D reconstruction that relies on multiple viewpoints, in this case, images are only observed from a single viewpoint. This challenge can be partially addressed by observing how galaxy emitters throughout the volume are lensed. However, this leads to the second challenge: the shapes and exact locations of unlensed galaxies are unknown, and can only be estimated with a very large degree of uncertainty. This introduces an overwhelming amount of noise which nearly drowns out the lensing signal completely. Previous approaches tackle this by imposing strong assumptions about the structures in the volume.  We instead propose a methodology using a gravitationally-constrained neural field to flexibly model the continuous matter distribution. We take an analysis-by-synthesis approach, optimizing the weights of the neural network through a fully differentiable physical forward model to reproduce the lensing signal present in image measurements. We showcase our method on simulations, including realistic simulated measurements of dark matter distributions that mimic data from upcoming telescope surveys. Our results show that our method can not only outperform previous methods, but importantly is also able to recover potentially surprising dark matter structures."
Poster,Reveal Object in Lensless Photography via Region Gaze and Amplification,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30401,"Xiangjun Yin, Huihui Yue","Detecting concealed objects, such as in vivo lesions or camouflage, requires customized imaging systems. Lensless cameras, being compact and flexible, offer a promising alternative to bulky lens systems. However, the absence of lenses leads to measurements lacking visual semantics, posing significant challenges for concealed object detection (COD). To tackle this issue, we propose a region gaze-amplification network (RGANet) for progressively exploiting concealed objects from lensless imaging measurements. Specifically, a region gaze module (RGM) is proposed to mine spatial-frequency cues informed by biological and psychological mechanisms, and a region amplifier (RA) is designed to amplify the details of object regions to enhance COD performance. Furthermore, we contribute the first relevant dataset as a benchmark to prosper the lensless imaging community. Extensive experiments demonstrate the exciting performance of our method. Our codes will be released in \url{https://github.com/YXJ-NTU/Lensless-COD}."
Poster,RevisEval: Improving LLM-as-a-Judge via Response-Adapted References,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31178,"Qiyuan Zhang, Yufei Wang, Tiezheng YU, Yuxin Jiang, Chuhan Wu, Liangyou Li, Yasheng Wang, Xin Jiang, Lifeng Shang, Ruiming Tang, Fuyuan Lyu, Chen Ma","With significant efforts in recent studies, LLM-as-a-Judge has become a cost-effective alternative to human evaluation for assessing text generation quality in a wide range of tasks. However, there still remains a reliability gap between LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluation. One important reason is the lack of guided oracles in the evaluation process. Motivated by the role of reference pervasively used in classic text evaluation, we introduce RevisEval, a novel text generation evaluation paradigm via the response-adapted references. RevisEval is driven by the key observation that an ideal reference should maintain the necessary relevance to the response to be evaluated. Specifically, RevisEval leverages the text revision capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adaptively revise the response, then treat the revised text as the reference (response-adapted reference) for the subsequent evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RevisEval outperforms traditional reference-free and reference-based evaluation paradigms that use LLM-as-a-Judge across NLG tasks and open-ended instruction-following tasks. More importantly, our response-adapted references can further boost the classical text metrics, e.g., BLEU and BERTScore, compared to traditional references and even rival the LLM-as-a-Judge. A detailed analysis is also conducted to confirm RevisEval's effectiveness in bias reduction, the impact of inference cost, and reference relevance."
Poster,Revisiting a Design Choice in Gradient Temporal Difference Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31094,"Xiaochi Qian, Shangtong Zhang","Off-policy learning enables a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to reason counterfactually about policies that are not executed and is one of the most important ideas in RL. It, however, can lead to instability when combined with function approximation and bootstrapping, two arguably indispensable ingredients for large-scale reinforcement learning. This is the notorious deadly triad. The seminal work Sutton et al. (2008) pioneers Gradient Temporal Difference learning (GTD) as the first solution to the deadly triad, which has enjoyed massive success thereafter. During the derivation of GTD, some intermediate algorithm, called $A^\top$TD, was invented but soon deemed inferior. In this paper, we revisit this $A^\top$TD and prove that a variant of $A^\top$TD, called $A_t^\top$TD, is also an effective solution to the deadly triad. Furthermore, this $A_t^\top$TD only needs one set of parameters and one learning rate. By contrast, GTD has two sets of parameters and two learning rates, making it hard to tune in practice.  We provide asymptotic analysis for $A^\top_t$TD and finite sample analysis for a variant of $A^\top_t$TD that additionally involves a projection operator. The convergence rate of this variant is on par with the canonical on-policy temporal difference learning."
Poster,Revisiting Convolution Architecture in the Realm of DNA Foundation Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30599,"Yu Bo, Weian Mao, Daniel Shao, Weiqiang Bai, Peng Ye, Xinzhu Ma, Junbo Zhao, Hao Chen, Chunhua Shen","In recent years, A variety of methods based on Transformer and state space model (SSM) architectures have been proposed, advancing foundational DNA language models. However, there is a lack of comparison between these recent approaches and the classical architecture—convolutional networks (CNNs)—on foundation model benchmarks.This raises the question: are CNNs truly being surpassed by these recent approaches based on transformer and SSM architectures? In this paper, we develop a simple but well-designed CNN-based method, termed ConvNova. ConvNova identifies and proposes three effective designs: 1) dilated convolutions, 2) gated convolutions, and 3) a dual-branch framework for gating mechanisms. Through extensive empirical experiments, we demonstrate that ConvNova significantly outperforms recent methods on more than half of the tasks across several foundation model benchmarks. For example, in histone-related tasks, ConvNova exceeds the second-best method by an average of 5.8\%, while generally utilizing fewer parameters and enabling faster computation.  In addition, the experiments observed findings that may be related to biological characteristics. This indicates that CNNs are still a strong competitor compared to Transformers and SSMs. We anticipate that this work will spark renewed interest in CNN-based methods for DNA foundation models."
