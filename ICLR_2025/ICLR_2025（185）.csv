Poster,Learning Continually by Spectral Regularization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30217,"Alex Lewandowski, Michał Bortkiewicz, Saurabh Kumar, Andras Gyorgy, Dale Schuurmans, Mateusz Ostaszewski, Marlos C. Machado","Loss of plasticity is a phenomenon where neural networks can become more difficult to train over the course of learning. Continual learning algorithms seek to mitigate this effect by sustaining good performance while maintaining network trainability. We develop a new technique for improving continual learning inspired by the observation that the singular values of the neural network parameters at initialization are an important factor for trainability during early phases of learning. From this perspective, we derive a new spectral regularizer for continual learning that better sustains these beneficial initialization properties throughout training. In particular, the regularizer keeps the maximum singular value of each layer close to one. Spectral regularization directly ensures that gradient diversity is maintained throughout training, which promotes continual trainability, while minimally interfering with performance in a single task. We present an experimental analysis that shows how the proposed spectral regularizer can sustain trainability and performance across a range of model architectures in continual supervised and reinforcement learning settings. Spectral regularization is less sensitive to hyperparameters while demonstrating better training in individual tasks, sustaining trainability as new tasks arrive, and achieving better generalization performance.."
Poster,Learning Diagrams: A Graphical Language for Compositional Training Regimes,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28962,"Mason Lary, Richard Samuelson, Alexander Wilentz, Alina Zare, Matthew Klawonn, James Fairbanks","Motivated by deep learning regimes with multiple interacting yet distinct model components, we introduce learning diagrams, graphical depictions of training setups that capture parameterized learning as data rather than code. A learning diagram compiles to a unique loss function on which component models are trained. The result of training on this loss is a collection of models whose predictions ``agree"" with one another. We show that a number of popular learning setups such as few-shot multi-task learning, knowledge distillation, and multi-modal learning can be depicted as learning diagrams. We further implement learning diagrams in a library that allows users to build diagrams of PyTorch and Flux.jl models. By implementing some classic machine learning use cases, we demonstrate how learning diagrams allow practitioners to build complicated models as compositions of smaller components, identify relationships between workflows, and manipulate models during or after training. Leveraging a category theoretic framework, we introduce a rigorous semantics for learning diagrams that puts such operations on a firm mathematical foundation."
Poster,Learning Distributions of Complex Fluid Simulations with Diffusion Graph Networks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27985,"Mario Lino, Tobias Pfaff, Nils Thuerey","Physical systems with complex unsteady dynamics, such as fluid flows, are often poorly represented by a single mean solution. For many practical applications, it is crucial to access the full distribution of possible states, from which relevant statistics (e.g., RMS and two-point correlations) can be derived. Here, we propose a graph-based latent diffusion model that enables direct sampling of states from their equilibrium distribution, given a mesh discretization of the system and its physical parameters. This allows for the efficient computation of flow statistics without running long and expensive numerical simulations. The graph-based structure enables operations on unstructured meshes, which is critical for representing complex geometries with spatially localized high gradients, while latent-space diffusion modeling with a multi-scale GNN allows for efficient learning and inference of entire distributions of solutions. A key finding of our work is that the proposed networks can accurately learn full distributions even when trained on incomplete data from relatively short simulations. We apply this method to a range of fluid dynamics tasks, such as predicting pressure distributions on 3D wing models in turbulent flow, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency in challenging scenarios. The ability to directly sample accurate solutions, and capturing their diversity from short ground-truth simulations, is highly promising for complex scientific modeling tasks."
Poster,Learning Diverse Attacks on Large Language Models for Robust Red-Teaming and Safety Tuning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31186,"Seanie Lee, Minsu Kim, Lynn Cherif, David Dobre, Juho Lee, Sung Ju Hwang, Kenji Kawaguchi, Gauthier Gidel, Yoshua Bengio, Nikolay Malkin, Moksh Jain","Red-teaming, or identifying prompts that elicit harmful responses, is a critical step in ensuring the safe and responsible deployment of large language models (LLMs). Developing effective protection against many modes of attack prompts requires discovering diverse attacks. Automated red-teaming typically uses reinforcement learning to fine-tune an attacker language model to generate prompts that elicit undesirable responses from a target LLM, as measured, for example, by an auxiliary toxicity classifier. We show that even with explicit regularization to favor novelty and diversity, existing approaches suffer from mode collapse or fail to generate effective attacks. As a flexible and probabilistically principled alternative, we propose to use GFlowNet fine-tuning, followed by a secondary smoothing phase, to train the attacker model to generate *diverse* and *effective* attack prompts. We find that the attacks generated by our method are effective against a wide range of target LLMs, both with and without safety tuning, and transfer well between target LLMs. Finally, we demonstrate that models safety-tuned using a dataset of red-teaming prompts generated by our method are robust to attacks from other RL-based red-teaming approaches."
Poster,Learning Dynamics of Deep Matrix Factorization Beyond the Edge of Stability,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30132,"Avrajit Ghosh, Soo Min Kwon, Rongrong Wang, Saiprasad Ravishankar, Qing Qu","Deep neural networks trained using gradient descent with a fixed learning rate $\eta$ often operate in the regime of ``edge of stability'' (EOS), where the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian equilibrates about the stability threshold $2/\eta$. In this work, we present a fine-grained analysis of the learning dynamics of (deep) linear networks (DLNs) within the deep matrix factorization loss beyond EOS. For DLNs, loss oscillations beyond EOS follow a period-doubling route to chaos. We theoretically analyze the regime of the 2-period orbit and show that the loss oscillations occur within a small subspace, with the dimension of the subspace precisely characterized by the learning rate. The crux of our analysis lies in showing that the symmetry-induced conservation law for gradient flow, defined as the balancing gap among the singular values across layers, breaks at EOS and decays monotonically to zero. Overall, our results contribute to explaining two key phenomena in deep networks: (i) shallow models and simple tasks do not always exhibit EOS; and (ii) oscillations occur within top features}. We present experiments to support our theory, along with examples demonstrating how these phenomena occur in nonlinear networks and how they differ from those which have benign landscape such as in DLNs."
Poster,Learning Dynamics of LLM Finetuning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28056,"YI REN, Danica Sutherland","Learning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influences the model's predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language models during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of how influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a uniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algorithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypothetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning, e.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question A, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We also extend our framework and highlight a unique ``squeezing effect'' to explain a previously observed phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running DPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides insights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analysis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM's finetuning but also inspires a simple, effective method to improve alignment performance."
Poster,Learning Efficient Positional Encodings with Graph Neural Networks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30628,"Charilaos Kanatsoulis, Evelyn Choi, Stefanie Jegelka, Jure Leskovec, Alejandro Ribeiro","Positional encodings (PEs) are essential for effective graph representation learning because they provide position awareness in inherently position-agnostic transformer architectures and increase the expressive capacity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, designing powerful and efficient PEs for graphs poses significant challenges due to the absence of canonical node ordering and the scale of the graph. In this work, we identify four key properties that graph PEs should satisfy: stability, expressive power, scalability, and genericness. We find that existing eigenvector-based PE methods often fall short of jointly satisfying these criteria. To address this gap, we introduce PEARL, a novel framework of learnable PEs for graphs. Our primary insight is that message-passing GNNs function as nonlinear mappings of eigenvectors, enabling the design of GNN architectures for generating powerful and efficient PEs. A crucial challenge lies in initializing node features in a manner that is both expressive and permutation equivariant. We tackle this by initializing GNNs with random node inputs or standard basis vectors, thereby unlocking the expressive power of message-passing operations, while employing statistical pooling functions to maintain permutation equivariance. Our analysis demonstrates that PEARL approximates equivariant functions of eigenvectors with linear complexity, while rigorously establishing its stability and high expressive power. Experimental evaluations show that PEARL outperforms lightweight versions of eigenvector-based PEs and achieves comparable performance to full eigenvector-based PEs, but with one or two orders of magnitude lower complexity. Our code is available at https://github.com/ehejin/Pearl-PE."
Poster,Learning Equivariant Non-Local Electron Density Functionals,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30333,"Nicholas Gao, Eike Eberhard, Stephan Günnemann","The accuracy of density functional theory hinges on the approximation of non-local contributions to the exchange-correlation (XC) functional. To date, machine-learned and human-designed approximations suffer from insufficient accuracy, limited scalability, or dependence on costly reference data. To address these issues, we introduce Equivariant Graph Exchange Correlation (EG-XC), a novel non-local XC functional based on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs). Where previous works relied on semi-local functionals or fixed-size descriptors of the density, we compress the electron density into an SO(3)-equivariant nuclei-centered point cloud for efficient non-local atomic-range interactions. By applying an equivariant GNN on this point cloud, we capture molecular-range interactions in a scalable and accurate manner. To train EG-XC, we differentiate through a self-consistent field solver requiring only energy targets. In our empirical evaluation, we find EG-XC to accurately reconstruct `gold-standard' CCSD(T) energies on MD17. On out-of-distribution conformations of 3BPA, EG-XC reduces the relative MAE by 35% to 50%. Remarkably, EG-XC excels in data efficiency and molecular size extrapolation on QM9, matching force fields trained on 5 times more and larger molecules. On identical training sets, EG-XC yields on average 51% lower MAEs."
Poster,Learning Evolving Tools for Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27814,"Guoxin Chen, Zhong Zhang, Xin Cong, Fangda Guo, Yesai Wu, Yankai Lin, Wenzheng Feng, Yasheng Wang","Tool learning enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with external tools and APIs, greatly expanding the application scope of LLMs. However, due to the dynamic nature of external environments, these tools and APIs may become outdated over time, preventing LLMs from correctly invoking tools. Existing research primarily focuses on static environments and overlooks this issue, limiting the adaptability of LLMs in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose ToolEVO, a novel framework designed to enhance the adaptive and reflective capabilities of LLMs against tool variability. By leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search, ToolEVO facilitates active exploration and interaction of LLMs within dynamic environments, allowing for autonomous self-reflection and self-updating of tool usage based on environmental feedback. Additionally, we introduce ToolQA-D, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the impact of tool variability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our approach, highlighting the importance of adaptability to tool variability for effective tool learning."
Poster,Learning Fine-Grained Representations through Textual Token Disentanglement in Composed Video Retrieval,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27859,"Yue Wu, Zhaobo Qi, Yiling Wu, Junshu Sun, Yaowei Wang, Shuhui Wang","With the explosive growth of video data, finding videos that meet detailed requirements in large datasets has become a challenge. To address this, the composed video retrieval task has been introduced, enabling users to retrieve videos using complex queries that involve both visual and textual information. However, the inherent heterogeneity between the modalities poses significant challenges. Textual data are highly abstract, while video content contains substantial redundancy. The modality gap in information representation makes existing methods struggle with the modality fusion and alignment required for fine-grained composed retrieval. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce FineCVR-1M, a fine-grained composed video retrieval dataset containing 1,010,071 video-text triplets with detailed textual descriptions. This dataset is constructed through an automated process that identifies key concept changes between video pairs to generate textual descriptions for both static and action concepts. For fine-grained retrieval methods, the key challenge lies in understanding the detailed requirements. Text description serves as clear expressions of intent, but it requires models to distinguish subtle differences in the description of video semantics. Therefore, we propose a textual Feature Disentanglement and Cross-modal Alignment framework (FDCA) that disentangles features at both the sentence and token levels. At the sequence level, we separate text features into retained and injected features. At the token level, an Auxiliary Token Disentangling mechanism is proposed to disentangle texts into retained, injected, and excluded tokens. The disentanglement at both levels extracts fine-grained features, which are aligned and fused with the reference video to extract global representations for video retrieval. Experiments on FineCVR-1M dataset demonstrate the superior performance of FDCA. Our code and dataset are available at: https://may2333.github.io/FineCVR/."
