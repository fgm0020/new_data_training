Poster,Improving Pretraining Data Using Perplexity Correlations,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28733,"Tristan Thrush, Christopher Potts, Tatsunori Hashimoto","Quality pretraining data is often seen as the key to high-performance language models. However, progress in understanding pretraining data has been slow due to the costly pretraining runs required for data selection experiments. We present a framework that avoids these costs and selects high-quality pretraining data without any LLM training of our own.  Our work is based on a simple observation: LLM losses on many pretraining texts are correlated with downstream benchmark performance, and selecting high-correlation documents is an effective pretraining data selection method. We build a new statistical framework for data selection centered around estimates of perplexity-benchmark correlations and perform data selection using a sample of 90 LLMs taken from the Open LLM Leaderboard on texts from tens of thousands of web domains. In controlled pretraining experiments at the 160M parameter scale on 8 benchmarks, our approach outperforms DSIR on every benchmark, while matching the best data selector found in DataComp-LM, a hand-engineered bigram classifier. We have now also updated this paper to include results from preregistered experiments with new pretraining data on an aggregation of 22 benchmarks up to the 1.4B scale, showing increasing improvements of our method over others with more scale.

Poster,Improving Probabilistic Diffusion Models With Optimal Diagonal Covariance Matching,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28877,"Zijing Ou, Mingtian Zhang, Andi Zhang, Tim Xiao, Yingzhen Li, David Barber","The probabilistic diffusion model has become highly effective across various domains. Typically, sampling from a diffusion model involves using a denoising distribution characterized by a Gaussian with a learned mean and either fixed or learned covariances. In this paper, we leverage the recently proposed covariance moment matching technique and introduce a novel method for learning the diagonal covariances. Unlike traditional data-driven covariance approximation approaches, our method involves directly regressing the optimal analytic covariance using a new, unbiased objective named Optimal Covariance Matching (OCM). This approach can significantly reduce the approximation error in covariance prediction. We demonstrate how our method can substantially enhance the sampling efficiency, recall rate and likelihood of both diffusion models and latent diffusion models."
Poster,Improving Reasoning Performance in Large Language Models via Representation Engineering,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30146,"Bertram Højer, Oliver Jarvis, Stefan Heinrich","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have resulted in increasingly anthropomorphic language concerning the ability of LLMs to reason. Whether \textit{reasoning} in LLMs should be understood to be inherently different is, however, widely debated. We propose utilizing a representation engineering approach wherein model activations are read from the residual stream of an LLM when processing a reasoning task. The activations are used to derive a control vector that is applied to the model as an inference-time intervention, modulating the representational space of the model, to improve performance on the specified task. We publish the code for deriving control vectors and analyzing model representations. The method allows us to improve performance on reasoning benchmarks and assess how control vectors influence the final logit distribution of a model via metrics such as KL divergence and entropy. We apply control vectors to Mistral-7B-Instruct and a range of Pythia models on an inductive, a deductive and mathematical reasoning task. We show that an LLM can, to a certain degree, be controlled to improve its perceived reasoning ability by modulating activations. The intervention is dependent upon the ability to reliably extract the model's typical state when correctly solving a task. Our results suggest that reasoning performance can be modulated in the same manner as other information-processing tasks performed by LLMs and demonstrate that we are capable of improving performance on specific tasks via a simple intervention on the residual stream with no additional training."
Poster,Improving Semantic Understanding in Speech Language Models via Brain-tuning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30063,"Omer Moussa, Dietrich Klakow, Mariya Toneva","Speech language models align with human brain responses to natural language to an impressive degree. However, current models rely heavily on low-level speech features, indicating they lack brain-relevant semantics which limits their utility as model organisms of semantic processing in the brain. In this work, we address this limitation by inducing brain-relevant bias directly into the models via fine-tuning with fMRI recordings of people listening to natural stories--a process we name brain-tuning. After testing it on 3 different pretrained model families, we show that brain-tuning not only improves overall alignment with new brain recordings in semantic language regions, but also reduces the reliance on low-level speech features for this alignment. Excitingly, we further show that brain-tuning leads to 1) consistent improvements in performance on semantic downstream tasks and 2) a representational space with increased semantic preference. Our results provide converging evidence, for the first time, that incorporating brain signals into the training of language models improves the models’ semantic understanding."
Poster,Improving Text-to-Image Consistency via Automatic Prompt Optimization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31459,"Melissa Hall, Michal Drozdzal, Oscar Mañas, Pietro Astolfi, Jack Urbanek, Adina Williams, Aishwarya Agrawal, Candace Ross, Adriana Romero-Soriano","Impressive advances in text-to-image (T2I) generative models have yielded a plethora of high performing models which are able to generate aesthetically appealing, photorealistic images. Despite the progress, these models still struggle to produce images that are consistent with the input prompt, oftentimes failing to capture object quantities, relations and attributes properly. Existing solutions to improve prompt-image consistency suffer from the following challenges: (1) they oftentimes require model fine-tuning, (2) they only focus on nearby prompt samples, and (3) they are affected by unfavorable trade-offs among image quality, representation diversity, and prompt-image consistency. In this paper, we address these challenges and introduce a T2I optimization-by-prompting framework, OPT2I, which leverages a large language model (LLM) to improve prompt-image consistency in T2I models. Our framework starts from a user prompt and iteratively generates revised prompts with the goal of maximizing a consistency score. Our extensive validation on two datasets, MSCOCO and PartiPrompts, shows that OPT2I can boost the initial consistency score by up to 24.9% in terms of DSG score while preserving the FID and increasing the recall between generated and real data. Our work paves the way toward building more reliable and robust T2I systems by harnessing the power of LLMs."
Poster,Improving the Sparse Structure Learning of Spiking Neural Networks from the View of Compression Efficiency,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28809,"Jiangrong Shen, Qi Xu, Gang Pan, Badong Chen","The human brain utilizes spikes for information transmission and dynamically reorganizes its network structure to boost energy efficiency and cognitive capabilities throughout its lifespan. Drawing inspiration from this spike-based computation, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been developed to construct event-driven models that emulate this efficiency. Despite these advances, deep SNNs continue to suffer from over-parameterization during training and inference, a stark contrast to the brain’s ability to self-organize. Furthermore, existing sparse SNNs are challenged by maintaining optimal pruning levels due to a static pruning ratio, resulting in either under or over-pruning.In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage dynamic structure learning approach for deep SNNs, aimed at maintaining effective sparse training from scratch while optimizing compression efficiency. The first stage evaluates the compressibility of existing sparse subnetworks within SNNs using the PQ index, which facilitates an adaptive determination of the rewiring ratio for synaptic connections based on data compression insights. In the second stage, this rewiring ratio critically informs the dynamic synaptic connection rewiring process, including both pruning and regrowth. This approach significantly improves the exploration of sparse structures training in deep SNNs, adapting sparsity dynamically from the point view of compression efficiency.Our experiments demonstrate that this sparse training approach not only aligns with the performance of current deep SNNs models but also significantly improves the efficiency of compressing sparse SNNs. Crucially, it preserves the advantages of initiating training with sparse models and offers a promising solution for implementing Edge AI on neuromorphic hardware."
Poster,Improving Uncertainty Estimation through Semantically Diverse Language Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30224,"Lukas Aichberger, Kajetan Schweighofer, Mykyta Ielanskyi, Sepp Hochreiter","Large language models (LLMs) can suffer from hallucinations when generating text. These hallucinations impede various applications in society and industry by making LLMs untrustworthy. Current LLMs generate text in an autoregressive fashion by predicting and appending text tokens. When an LLM is uncertain about the semantic meaning of the next tokens to generate, it is likely to start hallucinating. Thus, it has been suggested that predictive uncertainty is one of the main causes of hallucinations. We introduce Semantically Diverse Language Generation (SDLG) to quantify predictive uncertainty in LLMs. SDLG steers the LLM to generate semantically diverse yet likely alternatives for an initially generated text. This approach provides a precise measure of aleatoric semantic uncertainty, detecting whether the initial text is likely to be hallucinated. Experiments on question-answering tasks demonstrate that SDLG consistently outperforms existing methods while being the most computationally efficient, setting a new standard for uncertainty estimation in LLMs."
Poster,Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28229,"Junjie Chen, Xiangheng He, Yusuke Miyao, Danushka Bollegala","Unsupervised constituency parsers organize phrases within a sentence into a tree-shaped syntactic constituent structure that reflects the organization of sentence semantics. However, the traditional objective of maximizing sentence log-likelihood (LL) does not explicitly account for the close relationship between the constituent structure and the semantics, resulting in a weak correlation between LL values and parsing accuracy.In this paper, we introduce a novel objective that trains parsers by maximizing SemInfo, the semantic information encoded in constituent structures.We introduce a bag-of-substrings model to represent the semantics and estimate the SemInfo value using the probability-weighted information metric.We apply the SemInfo maximization objective to training Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) parsers and develop a Tree Conditional Random Field (TreeCRF)-based model to facilitate the training. Experiments show that SemInfo correlates more strongly with parsing accuracy than LL, establishing SemInfo as a better unsupervised parsing objective.As a result, our algorithm significantly improves parsing accuracy by an average of 7.85 sentence-F1 scores across five PCFG variants and in four languages, achieving state-of-the-art level results in three of the four languages."
Poster,ImpScore: A Learnable Metric For Quantifying The Implicitness Level of Sentences,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28811,"Yuxin Wang, Xiaomeng Zhu, Weimin Lyu, Saeed Hassanpour, Soroush Vosoughi","Handling implicit language is essential for natural language processing systems to achieve precise text understanding and facilitate natural interactions with users. Despite its importance, the absence of a metric for accurately measuring the implicitness of language significantly constrains the depth of analysis possible in evaluating models' comprehension capabilities. This paper addresses this gap by developing a scalar metric that quantifies the implicitness level of language without relying on external references. Drawing on principles from traditional linguistics, we define ""implicitness"" as the divergence between semantic meaning and pragmatic interpretation. To operationalize this definition, we introduce ImpScore, a reference-free metric formulated through an interpretable regression model. This model is trained using pairwise contrastive learning on a specially curated dataset consisting of (*implicit sentence*, *explicit sentence*) pairs. We validate ImpScore through a user study that compares its assessments with human evaluations on out-of-distribution data, demonstrating its accuracy and strong correlation with human judgments. Additionally, we apply ImpScore to hate speech detection datasets, illustrating its utility and highlighting significant limitations in current large language models' ability to understand highly implicit content. Our metric is publicly available at https://github.com/audreycs/ImpScore."
Poster,Imputation for prediction: beware of diminishing returns.,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30481,"Marine Le Morvan, Gael Varoquaux","Missing values are prevalent across various fields, posing challenges for training and deploying predictive models. In this context, imputation is a common practice, driven by the hope that accurate imputations will enhance predictions. However, recent theoretical and empirical studies indicate that simple constant imputation can be consistent and competitive. This empirical study aims at clarifying *if* and *when* investing in advanced imputation methods yields significantly better predictions. Relating imputation and predictive accuracies across combinations of imputation and predictive models on 19 datasets, we show that imputation accuracy matters less i) when using expressive models, ii) when incorporating missingness indicators as complementary inputs, iii) matters much more for generated linear outcomes than for real-data outcomes. Interestingly, we also show that the use of the missingness indicator is beneficial to the prediction performance, even in MCAR scenarios. Overall, on real-data with powerful models, imputation quality has only a minor effect on prediction performance. Thus, investing in better imputations for improved predictions often offers limited benefits."
