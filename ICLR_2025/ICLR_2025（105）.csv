Poster,Efficient Diffusion Transformer Policies with Mixture of Expert Denoisers for Multitask Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28417,"Moritz Reuss, Jyothish Pari, Pulkit Agrawal, Rudolf Lioutikov","Diffusion Policies have become widely used in Imitation Learning, offering several appealing properties, such as generating multimodal and discontinuous behavior.As models are becoming larger to capture more complex capabilities, their computational demands increase, as shown by recent scaling laws. Therefore, continuing with the current architectures will present a computational roadblock. To address this gap, we propose Mixture-of-Denoising Experts (MoDE) as a novel policy for Imitation Learning.MoDE surpasses current state-of-the-art Transformer-based Diffusion Policies while enabling parameter-efficient scaling through sparse experts and noise-conditioned routing, reducing both active parameters by 40\% and inference costs by 90\% via expert caching.Our architecture combines this efficient scaling with noise-conditioned self-attention mechanism, enabling more effective denoising across different noise levels. MoDE achieves state-of-the-art performance on 134 tasks in four established imitation learning benchmarks (CALVIN and LIBERO). Notably, by pretraining MoDE on diverse robotics data, we achieve 4.01 on CALVIN ABC and 0.95 on LIBERO-90. It surpasses both CNN-based and Transformer Diffusion Policies by an average of $57\%$ across 4 benchmarks, while using 90\% fewer FLOPs and fewer active parameters compared to default Diffusion Transformer architectures. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablations on MoDE's components, providing insights for designing efficient and scalable Transformer architectures for Diffusion Policies.

Poster,Efficient Discovery of Pareto Front for Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28888,"Ruohong Liu, Yuxin Pan, Linjie Xu, Lei Song, Pengcheng You, Yize Chen, Jiang Bian","Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) excels at handling rapidly changing preferences in tasks that involve multiple criteria, even for unseen preferences. However, previous dominating MORL methods typically generate a fixed policy set or preference-conditioned policy through multiple training iterations exclusively for sampled preference vectors, and cannot ensure the efficient discovery of the Pareto front. Furthermore, integrating preferences into the input of policy or value functions presents scalability challenges, in particular as the dimension of the state and preference space grow, which can complicate the learning process and hinder the algorithm's performance on more complex tasks. To address these issues, we propose a two-stage Pareto front discovery algorithm called Constrained MORL (C-MORL), which serves as a seamless bridge between constrained policy optimization and MORL. Concretely, a set of policies is trained in parallel in the initialization stage, with each optimized towards its individual preference over the multiple objectives. Then, to fill the remaining vacancies in the Pareto front, the constrained optimization steps are employed to maximize one objective while constraining the other objectives to exceed a predefined threshold. Empirically, compared to recent advancements in MORL methods, our algorithm achieves more consistent and superior performances in terms of hypervolume, expected utility, and sparsity on both discrete and continuous control tasks, especially with numerous objectives (up to nine objectives in our experiments)."
Poster,Efficient Distribution Matching of Representations via Noise-Injected Deep InfoMax,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28477,"Ivan Butakov, Alexander Semenenko, Alexander Tolmachev, Andrey Gladkov, Marina Munkhoeva, Alexey Frolov","Deep InfoMax (DIM) is a well-established method for self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) based on maximization of the mutual information between the input and the output of a deep neural network encoder. Despite the DIM and contrastive SSRL in general being well-explored, the task of learning representations conforming to a specific distribution (i.e., distribution matching, DM) is still under-addressed. Motivated by the importance of DM to several downstream tasks (including generative modeling, disentanglement, outliers detection and other), we enhance DIM to enable automatic matching of learned representations to a selected prior distribution. To achieve this, we propose injecting an independent noise into the normalized outputs of the encoder, while keeping the same InfoMax training objective. We show that such modification allows for learning uniformly and normally distributed representations, as well as representations of other absolutely continuous distributions. Our approach is tested on various downstream tasks. The results indicate a moderate trade-off between the performance on the downstream tasks and quality of DM."
Poster,Efficient Diversity-Preserving Diffusion Alignment via Gradient-Informed GFlowNets,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30600,"Zhen Liu, Tim Xiao, Weiyang Liu, Yoshua Bengio, Dinghuai Zhang","While one commonly trains large diffusion models by collecting datasets on target downstream tasks, it is often desired to align and finetune pretrained diffusion models with some reward functions that are either designed by experts or learned from small-scale datasets. Existing post-training methods for reward finetuning of diffusion models typically suffer from lack of diversity in generated samples, lack of prior preservation, and/or slow convergence in finetuning. Inspired by recent successes in generative flow networks (GFlowNets), a class of probabilistic models that sample with the unnormalized density of a reward function, we propose a novel GFlowNet method dubbed Nabla-GFlowNet (abbreviated as \nabla-GFlowNet), the first GFlowNet method that leverages the rich signal in reward gradients, together with an objective called \nabla-DB plus its variant residual \nabla-DB designed for prior-preserving diffusion finetuning. We show that our proposed method achieves fast yet diversity- and prior-preserving finetuning of Stable Diffusion, a large-scale text-conditioned image diffusion model, on different realistic reward functions."
Poster,Efficient Evolutionary Search Over Chemical Space with Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29136,"Haorui Wang, Marta Skreta, Cher-Tian Ser, Wenhao Gao, Lingkai Kong, Felix Strieth-Kalthoff, Chenru Duan, Yuchen Zhuang, Yue Yu, Yanqiao Zhu, Yuanqi Du, Alan Aspuru-Guzik, Kirill Neklyudov, Chao Zhang","Molecular discovery, when formulated as an optimization problem, presents significant computational challenges because optimization objectives can be non-differentiable. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), often used to optimize black-box objectives in molecular discovery, traverse chemical space by performing random mutations and crossovers, leading to a large number of expensive objective evaluations. In this work, we ameliorate this shortcoming by incorporating chemistry-aware Large Language Models (LLMs) into EAs. Namely, we redesign crossover and mutation operations in EAs using LLMs trained on large corpora of chemical information. We perform extensive empirical studies on both commercial and open-source models on multiple tasks involving property optimization, molecular rediscovery, and structure-based drug design, demonstrating that the joint usage of LLMs with EAs yields superior performance over all baseline models across single- and multi-objective settings. We demonstrate that our algorithm improves both the quality of the final solution and convergence speed, thereby reducing the number of required objective evaluations."
Poster,Efficient Exploration and Discriminative World Model Learning with an Object-Centric Abstraction,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28750,"Anthony GX-Chen, Kenneth Marino, Rob Fergus","In the face of difficult exploration problems in reinforcement learning, we study whether giving an agent an object-centric mapping (describing a set of items and their attributes) allow for more efficient learning. We found this problem is best solved hierarchically by modelling items at a higher level of state abstraction to pixels, and attribute change at a higher level of temporal abstraction to primitive actions. This abstraction simplifies the transition dynamic by making specific future states easier to predict. We make use of this to propose a fully model-based algorithm that learns a discriminative world model, plans to explore efficiently with only a count-based intrinsic reward, and can subsequently plan to reach any discovered (abstract) states.We demonstrate the model's ability to (i) efficiently solve single tasks, (ii) transfer zero-shot and few-shot across item types and environments, and (iii) plan across long horizons. Across a suite of 2D crafting and MiniHack environments, we empirically show our model significantly out-performs state-of-the-art low-level methods (without abstraction), as well as performant model-free and model-based methods using the same abstraction. Finally, we show how to learn low level object-perturbing policies via reinforcement learning, and the object mapping itself by supervised learning."
Poster,Efficient Imitation under Misspecification,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28859,"Nicolas Espinosa Dice, Sanjiban Choudhury, Wen Sun, Gokul Swamy","We consider the problem of imitation learning under misspecification: settings where the learner is fundamentally unable to replicate expert behavior everywhere. This is often true in practice due to differences in observation space and action space expressiveness (e.g. perceptual or morphological differences between robots and humans). Given the learner must make some mistakes in the misspecified setting, interaction with the environment is fundamentally required to figure out which mistakes are particularly costly and lead to compounding errors. However, given the computational cost and safety concerns inherent in interaction, we'd like to perform as little of it as possible while ensuring we've learned a strong policy. Accordingly, prior work has proposed a flavor of efficient inverse reinforcement learning algorithms that merely perform a computationally efficient local search procedure with strong guarantees in the realizable setting. We first prove that under a novel structural condition we term reward-agnostic policy completeness, these sorts of local-search based IRL algorithms are able to avoid compounding errors. We then consider the question of where we should perform local search in the first place, given the learner may not be able to ""walk on a tightrope"" as well as the expert in the misspecified setting. We prove that in the misspecified setting, it is beneficial to broaden the set of states on which local search is performed to include those reachable by good policies the learner can actually play. We then experimentally explore a variety of sources of misspecification and how offline data can be used to effectively broaden where we perform local search from."
Poster,Efficient Inference for Large Language Model-based Generative Recommendation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30645,"Xinyu Lin, Chaoqun Yang, Wenjie Wang, Yongqi Li, Cunxiao Du, Fuli Feng, See-Kiong Ng, Tat-Seng Chua","Large Language Model (LLM)-based generative recommendation has achieved notable success, yet its practical deployment is costly particularly due to excessive inference latency caused by autoregressive decoding. For lossless LLM decoding acceleration, Speculative Decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising solution. However, applying SD to generative recommendation presents unique challenges due to the requirement of generating top-K items (i.e., K distinct token sequences) as a recommendation list by beam search. This leads to more stringent verification in SD, where all the top-K sequences from the target LLM must be successfully drafted by the draft model at each decoding step. To alleviate this, we consider 1) boosting top-K sequence alignment between the draft model and the target LLM, and 2) relaxing the verification strategy to reduce trivial LLM calls. To this end, we propose an alignment framework named AtSpeed, which presents the AtSpeed-S optimization objective for top-K alignment under the strict top-K verification. Moreover, we introduce a relaxed sampling verification strategy that allows high-probability non-top-K drafted sequences to be accepted, significantly reducing LLM calls. Correspondingly, we propose AtSpeed-R for top-K alignment under this relaxed sampling verification. Empirical results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that AtSpeed significantly accelerates LLM-based generative recommendation, e.g., near 2x speedup under strict top-K verification and up to 2.5x speedup under relaxed sampling verification. The codes and datasets are available at~\url{https://github.com/Linxyhaha/AtSpeed}."
Poster,Efficient Interpolation between Extragradient and Proximal Methods for Weak MVIs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29271,"Thomas Pethick, Ioannis Mavrothalassitis, Volkan Cevher","We study nonmonotone games satisfying the weak Minty variational inequality (MVI) with parameter $\rho \in (-\tfrac{1}{L}, \infty)$, where $L$ is the Lipschitz constant of the gradient operator. An error corrected version of the inexact proximal point algorithm is proposed, with which we establish the first $\mathcal O(1/\epsilon)$ rate for the entire range $\rho \in (-\tfrac{1}{L}, \infty)$, thus removing a logarithmic factor compared with the complexity of existing methods. The scheme automatically selects the needed accuracy for the proximal computation, and can recover the relaxed extragradient method when $\rho > -\tfrac{1}{2L}$ and the relaxed proximal point algorithm (rPPA) when $\rho > -\tfrac{1}{L}$. Due to the error correction, the scheme inherits the strong properties of the _exact_ rPPA. Specifically, we show that linear convergence is automatically achieved under appropriate conditions. Tightness for the range of $\rho$ is established through a lower bound for rPPA. Central to the algorithmic construction is a halfspace projection, where the key insight is that the allowed error tolerance can both be used to correct for the proximal approximation and to enlarge the problem class."
Poster,EFFICIENT JAILBREAK ATTACK SEQUENCES ON LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS VIA MULTI-ARMED BANDIT-BASED CONTEXT SWITCHING,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28647,"Aditya Ramesh, Shivam Bhardwaj, Aditya Saibewar, Manohar Kaul","Content warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and content.Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made them increasingly vulnerable to jailbreaking attempts, where malicious users manipulate models into generating harmful content. While existing approaches rely on either single-step attacks that trigger immediate safety responses or multi-step methods that inefficiently iterate prompts using other LLMs, we introduce ``Sequence of Context"" (SoC) attacks that systematically alter conversational context through strategically crafted context-switching queries (CSQs). We formulate this as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) optimization problem, automatically learning optimal sequences of CSQs that gradually weaken the model's safety boundaries. Our theoretical analysis provides tight bounds on both the expected sequence length until successful jailbreak and the convergence of cumulative rewards. Empirically, our method achieves a 95\% attack success rate, surpassing PAIR by 63.15\%, AutoDAN by 60\%, and ReNeLLM by 50\%. We evaluate our attack across multiple open-source LLMs including Llama and Mistral variants. Our findings highlight critical vulnerabilities in current LLM safeguards and emphasize the need for defenses that consider sequential attack patterns rather than relying solely on static prompt filtering or iterative refinement."
