Poster,ScImage: How good are multimodal large language models at scientific text-to-image generation?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27964,"Leixin Zhang, Steffen Eger, Yinjie Cheng, Weihe Zhai, Jonas Belouadi, Fahimeh Moafian, Zhixue Zhao","Multimodal large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality images from textual instructions. However, their performance in generating scientific images—a critical application for accelerating scientific progress—remains underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by introducing ScImage, a benchmark designed to evaluate the multimodal capabilities of LLMs in generating scientific images from textual descriptions. ScImage assesses three key dimensions of understanding: spatial, numeric, and attribute comprehension, as well as their combinations, focusing on the relationships between scientific objects (e.g., squares, circles). We evaluate seven models, GPT-4o, Llama, AutomaTikZ, Dall-E, StableDiffusion, GPT-o1 and Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct using two modes of output generation: code-based outputs (Python, TikZ) and direct raster image generation. Additionally, we examine four different input languages: English, German, Farsi, and Chinese. Our evaluation, conducted with 11 scientists across three criteria (correctness, relevance, and scientific accuracy), reveals that while GPT4-o produces outputs of decent quality for simpler prompts involving individual dimensions such as spatial, numeric, or attribute understanding in isolation, all models face challenges in this task, especially for more complex prompts.

Poster,SC-OmniGS: Self-Calibrating Omnidirectional Gaussian Splatting,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30809,"Huajian Huang, Yingshu Chen, Longwei Li, Hui Cheng, Tristan Braud, Yajie Zhao, Sai-Kit Yeung","360-degree cameras streamline data collection for radiance field 3D reconstruction by capturing comprehensive scene data. However, traditional radiance field methods do not address the specific challenges inherent to 360-degree images. We present SC-OmniGS, a novel self-calibrating omnidirectional Gaussian splatting system for fast and accurate omnidirectional radiance field reconstruction using 360-degree images. Rather than converting 360-degree images to cube maps and performing perspective image calibration, we treat 360-degree images as a whole sphere and derive a mathematical framework that enables direct omnidirectional camera pose calibration accompanied by 3D Gaussians optimization. Furthermore, we introduce a differentiable omnidirectional camera model in order to rectify the distortion of real-world data for performance enhancement. Overall, the omnidirectional camera intrinsic model, extrinsic poses, and 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized by minimizing weighted spherical photometric loss. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed SC-OmniGS is able to recover a high-quality radiance field from noisy camera poses or even no pose prior in challenging scenarios characterized by wide baselines and non-object-centric configurations. The noticeable performance gain in the real-world dataset captured by consumer-grade omnidirectional cameras verifies the effectiveness of our general omnidirectional camera model in reducing the distortion of 360-degree images."
Poster,SCOPE: A Self-supervised Framework for Improving Faithfulness in Conditional Text Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28981,"Song Duong, Florian Le Bronnec, Alexandre Allauzen, Vincent Guigue, Alberto Lumbreras, Laure Soulier, patrick Gallinari","Large Language Models (LLMs), when used for conditional text generation, often produce hallucinations, i.e., information that is unfaithful or not grounded in the input context. This issue arises in typical conditional text generation tasks, such as text summarization and data-to-text generation, where the goal is to produce fluent text based on contextual input. When fine-tuned on specific domains, LLMs struggle to provide faithful answers to a given context, often adding information or generating errors. One underlying cause of this issue is that LLMs rely on statistical patterns learned from their training data. This reliance can interfere with the model's ability to stay faithful to a provided context, leading to the generation of ungrounded information. We build upon this observation and introduce a novel self-supervised method for generating a training set of unfaithful samples. We then refine the model using a training process that encourages the generation of grounded outputs over unfaithful ones, drawing on preference-based training. Our approach leads to significantly more grounded text generation, outperforming existing self-supervised techniques in faithfulness, as evaluated through automatic metrics, LLM-based assessments, and human evaluations."
Poster,Score-based free-form architectures for high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30928,"Feng Liu, Faguo Wu, Xiao Zhang","Deep learning methods incorporate PDE residuals as the loss function for solving Fokker-Planck equations, and usually impose the proper normalization condition to avoid a trivial solution. However, soft constraints require careful balancing of multi-objective loss functions, and specific network architectures may limit representation capacity under hard constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework: Fokker-Planck neural network (FPNN) that adopts a score PDE loss to decouple the score learning and the density normalization into two stages. Our method allows free-form network architectures to model the unnormalized density and strictly satisfy normalization constraints by post-processing. We demonstrate the effectiveness on various high-dimensional steady-state Fokker-Planck (SFP) equations, achieving superior accuracy and over a 20$\times$ speedup compared to state-of-the-art methods. Without any labeled data, FPNNs achieve the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 11.36%, 13.87% and 12.72% for 4D Ring, 6D Unimodal and 6D Multi-modal problems respectively, requiring only 256, 980, and 980 parameters. Experimental results highlights the potential as a universal fast solver for handling more than 20-dimensional SFP equations, with great gains in efficiency, accuracy, memory and computational resource usage."
Poster,Score-based Self-supervised MRI Denoising,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27982,"Jiachen Tu, Yaokun Shi, Fan Lam","Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful noninvasive diagnostic imaging tool that provides unparalleled soft tissue contrast and anatomical detail. Noise contamination, especially in accelerated and/or low-field acquisitions, can significantly degrade image quality and diagnostic accuracy. Supervised learning based denoising approaches have achieved impressive performance but require high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) labels, which are often unavailable. Self-supervised learning holds promise to address the label scarcity issue, but existing self-supervised denoising methods tend to oversmooth fine spatial features and often yield inferior performance than supervised methods. We introduce Corruption2Self (C2S), a novel score-based self-supervised framework for MRI denoising. At the core of C2S is a generalized denoising score matching (GDSM) loss, which extends denoising score matching to work directly with noisy observations by modeling the conditional expectation of higher-SNR images given further corrupted observations. This allows the model to effectively learn denoising across multiple noise levels directly from noisy data. Additionally, we incorporate a reparameterization of noise levels to stabilize training and enhance convergence, and introduce a detail refinement extension to balance noise reduction with the preservation of fine spatial features. Moreover, C2S can be extended to multi-contrast denoising by leveraging complementary information across different MRI contrasts. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-supervised methods and competitive results compared to supervised counterparts across varying noise conditions and MRI contrasts on the M4Raw and fastMRI dataset.

Poster,"Score Forgetting Distillation: A Swift, Data-Free Method for Machine Unlearning in Diffusion Models",https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28804,"Tianqi Chen, Shujian Zhang, Mingyuan Zhou","The machine learning community is increasingly recognizing the importance of fostering trust and safety in modern generative AI (GenAI) models. We posit machine unlearning (MU) as a crucial foundation for developing safe, secure, and trustworthy GenAI models. Traditional MU methods often rely on stringent assumptions and require access to real data. This paper introduces Score Forgetting Distillation (SFD), an innovative MU approach that promotes the forgetting of undesirable information in diffusion models by aligning the conditional scores of ""unsafe"" classes or concepts with those of ""safe"" ones. To eliminate the need for real data, our SFD framework incorporates a score-based MU loss into the score distillation objective of a pretrained diffusion model. This serves as a regularization term that preserves desired generation capabilities while enabling the production of synthetic data through a one-step generator. Our experiments on pretrained label-conditional and text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our method effectively accelerates the forgetting of target classes or concepts during generation, while preserving the quality of other classes or concepts. This unlearned and distilled diffusion not only pioneers a novel concept in MU but also accelerates the generation speed of diffusion models. Our experiments and studies on a range of diffusion models and datasets confirm that our approach is generalizable, effective, and advantageous for MU in diffusion models.

Poster,Scrutinize What We Ignore: Reining In Task Representation Shift Of Context-Based Offline Meta Reinforcement Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30493,"Hai Zhang, Boyuan Zheng, Tianying Ji, Jinhang Liu, Anqi Guo, Junqiao Zhao, Lanqing Li","Offline meta reinforcement learning (OMRL) has emerged as a promising approach for interaction avoidance and strong generalization performance by leveraging pre-collected data and meta-learning techniques. Previous context-based approaches predominantly rely on the intuition that alternating optimization between the context encoder and the policy can lead to performance improvements, as long as the context encoder follows the principle of maximizing the mutual information between the task variable $M$ and its latent representation $Z$ ($I(Z;M)$) while the policy adopts the standard offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms conditioning on the learned task representation.Despite promising results, the theoretical justification of performance improvements for such intuition remains underexplored.Inspired by the return discrepancy scheme in the model-based RL field, we find that the previous optimization framework can be linked with the general RL objective of maximizing the expected return, thereby explaining performance improvements. Furthermore, after scrutinizing this optimization framework, we observe that the condition for monotonic performance improvements does not consider the variation of the task representation. When these variations are considered, the previously established condition may no longer be sufficient to ensure monotonicity, thereby impairing the optimization process.We name this issue \underline{task representation shift} and theoretically prove that the monotonic performance improvements can be guaranteed with appropriate context encoder updates.We use different settings to rein in the task representation shift on three widely adopted training objectives concerning maximizing $I(Z;M)$ across different data qualities.Empirical results show that reining in the task representation shift can indeed improve performance.Our work opens up a new avenue for OMRL, leading to a better understanding between the task representation and performance improvements."
Poster,SD-LoRA: Scalable Decoupled Low-Rank Adaptation for Class Incremental Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30945,"Yichen Wu, Hongming Piao, Long-Kai Huang, Renzhen Wang, Wanhua Li, Hanspeter Pfister, Deyu Meng, Kede Ma, Ying Wei","Continual Learning (CL) with foundation models has recently emerged as a promising paradigm to exploit abundant knowledge acquired during pre-training for tackling sequential tasks. However, existing prompt-based and Low-Rank Adaptation-based (LoRA-based) methods often require expanding a prompt/LoRA pool or retaining samples of previous tasks, which poses significant scalability challenges as the number of tasks grows. To address these limitations, we propose Scalable Decoupled LoRA (SD-LoRA) for class incremental learning, which continually separates the learning of the magnitude and direction of LoRA components without rehearsal. Our empirical and theoretical analysis reveals that SD-LoRA tends to follow a low-loss trajectory and converges to an overlapping low-loss region for all learned tasks, resulting in an excellent stability-plasticity trade-off. Building upon these insights, we introduce two variants of SD-LoRA with further improved parameter efficiency. All parameters of SD-LoRAs can be end-to-end optimized for CL objectives. Meanwhile, they support efficient inference by allowing direct evaluation with the finally trained model, obviating the need for component selection. Extensive experiments across multiple CL benchmarks and foundation models consistently validate the effectiveness of SD-LoRA. The code is available at https://github.com/WuYichen-97/SD-Lora-CL."
Poster,SEAL: Safety-enhanced Aligned LLM Fine-tuning via Bilevel Data Selection,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29422,"Han Shen, Pin-Yu Chen, Payel Das, Tianyi Chen","Fine-tuning on task-specific data to boost downstream performance is a crucial step for leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). However, though fine-tuning enhances the model performance for specialized applications, previous studies have demonstrated that fine-tuning the models on several adversarial samples or even benign data can greatly comprise the model's pre-equipped alignment and safety capabilities. In this work, we propose SEAL, a novel framework to enhance safety in LLM fine-tuning. SEAL learns a data ranker based on the bilevel optimization to up rank the safe and high-quality fine-tuning data and down rank the unsafe or low-quality ones. Models trained with SEAL demonstrate superior quality over multiple baselines, with 8.5\% and 9.7\% win rate increase compared to random selection respectively on Llama-3-8b-Instruct and Merlinite-7b models. Our code is available on github https://github.com/hanshen95/SEAL."
Poster,Searching for Optimal Solutions with LLMs via Bayesian Optimization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29164,"Dhruv Agarwal, Manoj Ghuhan Arivazhagan, Rajarshi Das, Sandesh Swamy, Sopan Khosla, Rashmi Gangadharaiah","Scaling test-time compute to search for optimal solutions is an important step towards building generally-capable language models that can reason. Recent work, however, shows that tasks of varying complexity require distinct search strategies to solve optimally, thus making it challenging to design a one-size-fits-all approach. Prior solutions either attempt to predict task difficulty to select the optimal search strategy, often infeasible in practice, or use a static, pre-defined strategy, e.g., repeated parallel sampling or greedy sequential search, which is sub-optimal. In this work, we argue for an alternative view using the probabilistic framework of Bayesian optimization (BO), where the search strategy is adapted dynamically based on the evolving uncertainty estimates of solutions as search progresses. To this end, we introduce Bayesian-OPRO (BOPRO)––a generalization of a recent method for in-context optimization, which iteratively samples from new proposal distributions by modifying the prompt to the LLM with a subset of its previous generations selected to explore or exploit different parts of the search space. We evaluate our method on word search, molecule optimization, and a joint hypothesis+program search task using a 1-D version of the challenging Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (1D-ARC). Our results show that BOPRO outperforms all baselines in word search (≥10 points) and molecule optimization (higher quality and 17% fewer invalid molecules), but trails a best-k prompting strategy in program search. Our analysis reveals that despite the ability to balance exploration and exploitation using BOPRO, failure is likely due to the inability of code representation models in distinguishing sequences with low edit-distances."
