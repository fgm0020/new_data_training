Poster,TraceVLA: Visual Trace Prompting Enhances Spatial-Temporal Awareness for Generalist Robotic Policies,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29130,"Ruijie Zheng, Yongyuan Liang, Shuaiyi Huang, Jianfeng Gao, Hal Daumé III, Andrey Kolobov, Furong Huang, Jianwei Yang","Although large vision-language-action (VLA) models pretrained on extensive robot datasets offer promising generalist policies for robotic learning, they still struggle with spatial-temporal dynamics in interactive robotics, making them less effective in handling complex tasks, such as manipulation. In this work, we introduce visual trace prompting, a simple yet effective approach to facilitate VLA models’ spatial-temporal awareness for action prediction by encoding state-action trajectories visually. We develop a new TraceVLA model by finetuningOpenVLA on our own collected dataset of 150K robot manipulation trajectories using visual trace prompting. Evaluations of TraceVLA across 137 configurations in SimplerEnv and 4 tasks on a physical WidowX robot demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, outperforming OpenVLA by 10% on SimplerEnv and 3.5x on real-robot tasks and exhibiting robust generalization across diverse embodiments and scenarios. To further validate the effectiveness and generality of our method, we present a compact VLA model based on 4B Phi-3-Vision, pretrained on the Open-X-Embodiment and finetuned on our dataset, rivals the 7B OpenVLA baseline while significantly improving inference efficiency."
Poster,Tracing Representation Progression: Analyzing and Enhancing Layer-Wise Similarity,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27907,"Jiachen Jiang, Jinxin Zhou, Zhihui Zhu","Analyzing the similarity of internal representations within and across different models has been an important technique for understanding the behavior of deep neural networks. Most existing methods for analyzing the similarity between representations of high dimensions, such as those based on Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), rely on statistical properties of the representations for a set of data points. In this paper, we focus on transformer models and study the similarity of representations between the hidden layers of individual transformers. In this context, we show that a simple sample-wise cosine similarity metric is capable of capturing the similarity and aligns with the complicated CKA. Our experimental results on common transformers reveal that representations across layers are positively correlated, with similarity increasing when layers get closer. We provide a theoretical justification for this phenomenon under the geodesic curve assumption for the learned transformer, a property that may approximately hold for residual networks. We then show that an increase in representation similarity implies an increase in predicted probability when directly applying the last-layer classifier to any hidden layer representation. This offers a justification for {\it saturation events}, where the model's top prediction remains unchanged across subsequent layers, indicating that the shallow layer has already learned the necessary knowledge. We then propose an aligned training method to improve the effectiveness of shallow layer by enhancing the similarity between internal representations, with trained models that enjoy the following properties: (1) more early saturation events, (2) layer-wise accuracies monotonically increase and reveal the minimal depth needed for the given task, (3) when served as multi-exit models, they achieve on-par performance with standard multi-exit architectures which consist of additional classifiers designed for early exiting in shallow layers. To our knowledge, our work is the first to show that one common classifier is sufficient for multi-exit models. We conduct experiments on both vision and NLP tasks to demonstrate the performance of the proposed aligned training."
Poster,Tracking objects that change in appearance with phase synchrony,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28488,"Sabine Muzellec, Drew Linsley, Alekh Ashok, Ennio Mingolla, Girik Malik, Rufin VanRullen, Thomas Serre","Objects we encounter often change appearance as we interact with them. Changes in illumination (shadows), object pose, or the movement of non-rigid objects can drastically alter available image features. How do biological visual systems track objects as they change? One plausible mechanism involves attentional mechanisms for reasoning about the locations of objects independently of their appearances --- a capability that prominent neuroscience theories have associated with computing through neural synchrony. Here, we describe a novel deep learning circuit that can learn to precisely control attention to features separately from their location in the world through neural synchrony: the complex-valued recurrent neural network (CV-RNN). Next, we compare object tracking in humans, the CV-RNN, and other deep neural networks (DNNs), using FeatureTracker: a large-scale challenge that asks observers to track objects as their locations and appearances change in precisely controlled ways. While humans effortlessly solved FeatureTracker, state-of-the-art DNNs did not. In contrast, our CV-RNN behaved similarly to humans on the challenge, providing a computational proof-of-concept for the role of phase synchronization as a neural substrate for tracking appearance-morphing objects as they move about."
Poster,Tracking the Copyright of Large Vision-Language Models through Parameter Learning Adversarial Images,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30074,"Yubo Wang, Jianting Tang, Liu, Linli Xu","Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable image understanding and dialogue capabilities, allowing them to handle a variety of visual question answering tasks. However, their widespread availability raises concerns about unauthorized usage and copyright infringement, where users or individuals can develop their own LVLMs by fine-tuning published models. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Parameter Learning Attack (PLA) for tracking the copyright of LVLMs without modifying the original model. Specifically, we construct adversarial images through targeted attacks against the original model, enabling it to generate specific outputs. To ensure these attacks remain effective on potential fine-tuned models to trigger copyright tracking, we allow the original model to learn the trigger images by updating parameters in the opposite direction during the adversarial attack process. Notably, the proposed method can be applied after the release of the original model, thus not affecting the model’s performance and behavior. To simulate real-world applications, we fine-tune the original model using various strategies across diverse datasets, creating a range of models for copyright verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can more effectively identify the original copyright of fine-tuned models compared to baseline methods. Therefore, this work provides a powerful tool for tracking copyrights and detecting unlicensed usage of LVLMs."
Poster,Track-On: Transformer-based Online Point Tracking with Memory,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28358,"Görkay Aydemir, Xiongyi Cai, Weidi Xie, Fatma Guney","In this paper, we consider the problem of long-term point tracking, which requires consistent identification of points across multiple frames in a video, despite changes in appearance, lighting, perspective, and occlusions. We target online tracking on a frame-by-frame basis, making it suitable for real-world, streaming scenarios. Specifically, we introduce Track-On, a simple transformer-based model designed for online long-term point tracking. Unlike prior methods that depend on full temporal modeling, our model processes video frames causally without access to future frames, leveraging two memory modules —spatial memory and context memory— to capture temporal information and maintain reliable point tracking over long time horizons. At inference time, it employs patch classification and refinement to identify correspondences and track points with high accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Track-On sets a new state-of-the-art for online models and delivers superior or competitive results compared to offline approaches on seven datasets, including the TAP-Vid benchmark. Our method offers a robust and scalable solution for real-time tracking in diverse applications. Project page: https://kuis-ai.github.io/track_on"
Poster,Tractable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning through Behavioral Economics,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28091,"Eric Mazumdar, Kishan Panaganti, Laixi Shi","A significant roadblock to the development of principled multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms is the fact that desired solution concepts like Nash equilibria may be intractable to compute. We show how one can overcome this obstacle by introducing concepts from behavioral economics into MARL. To do so, we imbue agents with two key features of human decision-making: risk aversion and bounded rationality. We show that introducing these two properties into games gives rise to a class of equilibria---risk-averse quantal response equilibria (RQE)---which are tractable to compute in \emph{all} $n$-player matrix and finite-horizon Markov games.  In particular, we show that they emerge as the endpoint of no-regret learning in suitably adjusted versions of the games. Crucially, the class of computationally tractable RQE is independent of the underlying game structure and only depends on agents' degrees of risk-aversion and bounded rationality.  To validate the expressivity of this class of solution concepts we show that it captures peoples' patterns of play in a number of 2-player matrix games previously studied in experimental economics. Furthermore, we give a first analysis of the sample complexity of computing these equilibria in finite-horizon Markov games when one has access to a generative model. We validate our findings on a simple multi-agent reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results open the doors for to the principled development of new decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms."
Poster,Trained Transformer Classifiers Generalize and Exhibit Benign Overfitting In-Context,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28608,"Spencer Frei, Gal Vardi","Transformers have the capacity to act as supervised learning algorithms: by properly encoding a set of labeled training (''in-context'') examples and an unlabeled test example into an input sequence of vectors of the same dimension, the forward pass of the transformer can produce predictions for that unlabeled test example.  A line of recent work has shown that when linear transformers are pre-trained on random instances for linear regression tasks, these trained transformers make predictions using an algorithm similar to that of ordinary least squares.  In this work, we investigate the behavior of linear transformers trained on random linear classification tasks.  Via an analysis of the implicit regularization of gradient descent, we characterize how many pre-training tasks and in-context examples are needed for the trained transformer to generalize well at test-time.  We further show that in some settings, these trained transformers can exhibit ''benign overfitting in-context'': when in-context examples are corrupted by label flipping noise, the transformer memorizes all of its in-context examples (including those with noisy labels) yet still generalizes near-optimally for clean test examples."
Poster,Training-Free Activation Sparsity in Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28994,"James Liu, Pragaash Ponnusamy, Tianle Cai, placeholder, Yoon Kim, Ben Athiwaratkun","Activation sparsity can enable practical inference speedups in large language models (LLMs) by reducing the compute and memory-movement required for  matrix multiplications during the forward pass. However, existing methods face limitations that inhibit widespread adoption. Some approaches are tailored towards older models with ReLU-based sparsity, while others require extensive continued pre-training on up to hundreds of billions of tokens. This paper describes TEAL (**T**raining-Fre**e** **A**ctivation Sparsity in **L**LMs), a simple training-free method that applies magnitude-based activation sparsity to hidden states throughout the entire model. TEAL achieves 40-50\% model-wide sparsity with minimal performance degradation across Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral families, with sizes varying from 7B to 70B. We improve existing sparse kernels and demonstrate wall-clock decoding speed-ups of up to 1.53× and 1.8× at 40\% and 50\% model-wide sparsity. TEAL is compatible with weight quantization, enabling further efficiency gains."
Poster,Training-free Camera Control for Video Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30066,"Chen Hou, Zhibo Chen","We propose a training-free and robust solution to offer camera movement control for off-the-shelf video diffusion models. Unlike previous work, our method does not require any supervised finetuning on camera-annotated datasets or self-supervised training via data augmentation. Instead, it is plug-and-play with most pretrained video diffusion models and can generate camera-controllable videos with a single image or text prompt as input. The inspiration for our work comes from the layout prior that intermediate latents encode for the generated results, thus rearranging noisy pixels in them will cause the output content to relocate as well. As camera moving could also be seen as a type of pixel rearrangement caused by perspective change, videos can be reorganized following specific camera motion if their noisy latents change accordingly. Building on this, we propose **CamTrol**, which enables robust camera control for video diffusion models. It is achieved by a two-stage process. First, we model image layout rearrangement through explicit camera movement in 3D point cloud space. Second, we generate videos with camera motion by leveraging the layout prior of noisy latents formed by a series of rearranged images. Extensive experiments have demonstrated its superior performance in both video generation and camera motion alignment compared with other finetuned methods. Furthermore, we show the capability of CamTrol to generalize to various base models, as well as its impressive applications in scalable motion control, dealing with complicated trajectories and unsupervised 3D video generation.

Poster,Training-Free Dataset Pruning for Instance Segmentation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28161,"Yalun Dai, Lingao Xiao, Ivor Tsang, Yang He","Existing dataset pruning techniques primarily focus on classification tasks, limiting their applicability to more complex and practical tasks like instance segmentation. Instance segmentation presents three key challenges: pixel-level annotations, instance area variations, and class imbalances, which significantly complicate dataset pruning efforts. Directly adapting existing classification-based pruning methods proves ineffective due to their reliance on time-consuming model training process. To address this, we propose a novel **T**raining-**F**ree **D**ataset **P**runing (**TFDP**) method for instance segmentation. Specifically, we leverage shape and class information from image annotations to design a Shape Complexity Score (SCS),  refining it into a Scale-Invariant (SI-SCS) and Class-Balanced (CB-SCS) versions to address instance area variations and class imbalances, all without requiring model training. We achieve state-of-the-art results on VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and MS COCO datasets, generalizing well across CNN and Transformer architectures. Remarkably, our approach accelerates the pruning process by an average of **1349$\times$** on COCO compared to the adapted baselines."
