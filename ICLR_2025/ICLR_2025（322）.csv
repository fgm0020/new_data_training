Poster,Spiking Vision Transformer with Saccadic Attention,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28227,"Shuai Wang, Malu Zhang, Dehao Zhang, Ammar Belatreche, Yichen Xiao, Yu Liang, Yimeng Shan, Qian Sun, Enqi Zhang, Yang Yang","The combination of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) holds potential for achieving both energy efficiency and high performance, particularly suitable for edge vision applications. However, a significant performance gap still exists between SNN-based ViTs and their ANN counterparts. Here, we first analyze why SNN-based ViTs suffer from limited performance and identify a mismatch between the vanilla self-attention mechanism and spatio-temporal spike trains. This mismatch results in degraded spatial relevance and limited temporal interactions. To address these issues, we draw inspiration from biological saccadic attention mechanisms and introduce an innovative Saccadic Spike Self-Attention (SSSA) method. Specifically, in the spatial domain, SSSA employs a novel spike distribution-based method to effectively assess the relevance between Query and Key pairs in SNN-based ViTs. Temporally, SSSA employs a saccadic interaction module that dynamically focuses on selected visual areas at each timestep and significantly enhances whole scene understanding through temporal interactions.Building on the SSSA mechanism, we develop a SNN-based Vision Transformer (SNN-ViT). Extensive experiments across various visual tasks demonstrate that SNN-ViT achieves state-of-the-art performance with linear computational complexity. The effectiveness and efficiency of the SNN-ViT highlight its potential for power-critical edge vision applications."
Poster,SpinQuant: LLM Quantization with Learned Rotations,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28338,"Zechun Liu, Changsheng Zhao, Igor Fedorov, Bilge Soran, Dhruv Choudhary, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yuandong Tian, Tijmen Blankevoort","Post-training quantization (PTQ) techniques applied to weights, activations, and the KV cache greatly reduce memory usage, latency, and power consumption of Large Language Models (LLMs), but may lead to large quantization errors when outliers are present. Rotating activation or weight matrices helps remove outliers and benefits quantization. In this work, we identify a collection of applicable rotation parameterizations that lead to identical outputs in full-precision Transformer architectures while enhancing quantization accuracy. In addition, we find that some random rotations lead to much better quantization than others, with an up to 13 points difference in downstream zero-shot reasoning performance. As a result, we propose SpinQuant, a novel approach that incorporates learned rotation matrices for optimal quantized network accuracy. With 4-bit quantization of weight, activation, and KV-cache, SpinQuant narrows the accuracy gap on zero-shot reasoning tasks with full precision to merely 2.9 points on the LLaMA-2 7B model, surpassing LLM-QAT by 19.1 points and SmoothQuant by 25.0 points. Furthermore, SpinQuant also outperforms concurrent work QuaRot, which applies random rotations to remove outliers. In particular, for LLaMA-3 8B models that are hard to quantize, SpinQuant reduces the gap to full precision by up to 45.1% relative to QuaRot.

Poster,SplatFormer: Point Transformer for Robust 3D Gaussian Splatting,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30697,"Yutong Chen, Marko Mihajlovic, Xiyi Chen, Yiming Wang, Sergey Prokudin, Siyu Tang","3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently transformed photorealistic reconstruction, achieving high visual fidelity and real-time performance. However, rendering quality significantly deteriorates when test views deviate from the camera angles used during training, posing a major challenge for applications in immersive free-viewpoint rendering and navigation. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 3DGS and related novel view synthesis methods under out-of-distribution (OOD) test camera scenarios. By creating diverse test cases with synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that most existing methods, including those incorporating various regularization techniques and data-driven priors, struggle to generalize effectively to OOD views. To address this limitation, we introduce SplatFormer, the first point transformer model specifically designed to operate on Gaussian splats. SplatFormer takes as input an initial 3DGS set optimized under limited training views and refines it in a single forward pass, effectively removing potential artifacts in OOD test views. To our knowledge, this is the first successful application of point transformers directly on 3DGS sets, surpassing the limitations of previous multi-scene training methods, which could handle only a restricted number of input views during inference. Our model significantly improves rendering quality under extreme novel views, achieving state-of-the-art performance in these challenging scenarios and outperforming various 3DGS regularization techniques, multi-scene models tailored for sparse view synthesis, and diffusion-based frameworks.

Poster,SplineGS: Learning Smooth Trajectories in Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Scene Reconstruction,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28059,"Jihwan Yoon, Sangbeom Han, Jaeseok Oh, Minsik Lee","Reconstructing complex scenes with deforming objects for novel view synthesis is a challenging task. Recent works have addressed this with 3D Gaussian Splatting, which effectively reconstructs static scenes with high quality in short training time, by adding specialized modules for the deformations of Gaussian blobs. However, designing an effective deformation module that incorporates appropriate spatiotemporal inductive biases still remains unresolved. To address this issue, we propose SplineGS in this paper, which utilizes non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS), an extension of B-spline, to represent temporally smooth deformation. A set of representative trajectories are learned based on NURBS, and the individual trajectories of Gaussian blobs are represented as linear combinations of these trajectories for spatial smoothness. The weights of the combinations are trained based on a multi-resolution hash table and an MLP, with the positions of the Gaussian blobs as the keys. Thanks to this design, the proposed method does not need any regularizers for trajectories, which enables efficient training. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method provides competitive performance over the existing methods with much shorter training time."
Poster,Sports-Traj: A Unified Trajectory Generation Model for Multi-Agent Movement in Sports,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30682,"Yi Xu, Yun Fu","Understanding multi-agent movement is critical across various fields. The conventional approaches typically focus on separate tasks such as trajectory prediction, imputation, or spatial-temporal recovery. Considering the unique formulation and constraint of each task, most existing methods are tailored for only one, limiting the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, which is a common requirement in real-world scenarios. Another limitation is that widely used public datasets mainly focus on pedestrian movements with casual, loosely connected patterns, where interactions between individuals are not always present, especially at a long distance, making them less representative of more structured environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Unified Trajectory Generation model, UniTraj, that processes arbitrary trajectories as masked inputs, adaptable to diverse scenarios in the domain of sports games. Specifically, we introduce a Ghost Spatial Masking (GSM) module, embedded within a Transformer encoder, for spatial feature extraction. We further extend recent State Space Models (SSMs), known as the Mamba model, into a Bidirectional Temporal Mamba (BTM) to better capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, we incorporate a Bidirectional Temporal Scaled (BTS) module to thoroughly scan trajectories while preserving temporal missing relationships. Furthermore, we curate and benchmark three practical sports datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model. We hope that our work can advance the understanding of human movement in real-world applications, particularly in sports. Our datasets, code, and model weights are available here https://github.com/colorfulfuture/UniTraj-pytorch."
Poster,SPORTU: A Comprehensive Sports Understanding Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27805,"Haotian Xia, Zhengbang Yang, Junbo Zou, Rhys Tracy, Yuqing Wang, Chi Lu, Christopher Lai, Yanjun He, Xun Shao, Zhuoqing Xie, Yuan-fang Wang, Weining Shen, Hanjie Chen","Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are advancing the ability to reason about complex sports scenarios by integrating textual and visual information. To comprehensively evaluate their capabilities, we introduce SPORTU, a benchmark designed to assess MLLMs across multi-level sports reasoning tasks. SPORTU comprises two key components: SPORTU-text, featuring 900 multiple-choice questions with human-annotated explanations for rule comprehension and strategy understanding. This component focuses on testing models' ability to reason about sports solely through question-answering (QA), without requiring visual inputs; SPORTU-video, consisting of 1,701 slow-motion video clips across 7 different sports and 12,048 QA pairs, designed to assess multi-level reasoning, from simple sports recognition to complex tasks like foul detection and rule application. We evaluated four prevalent LLMs mainly utilizing few-shot learning paradigms supplemented by chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting on the SPORTU-text part. GPT-4o achieves the highest accuracy of 71\%, but still falls short of human-level performance, highlighting room for improvement in rule comprehension and reasoning. The evaluation for the SPORTU-video part includes 6 proprietary and 8 open-source MLLMs. Experiments show that models fall short on hard tasks that require deep reasoning and rule-based understanding. GPT-4o performs the best with only 57.8\% accuracy on the hard task, showing large room for improvement. We hope that SPORTU will serve as a critical step toward evaluating models' capabilities in sports understanding and reasoning.

Poster,Spreading Out-of-Distribution Detection on Graphs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28324,"Daeho Um, Jongin Lim, Sunoh Kim, Yuneil Yeo, Yoonho Jung","Node-level out-of-distribution (OOD) detection on graphs has received significant attention from the machine learning community. However, previous approaches are evaluated using unrealistic benchmarks that consider only randomly selected OOD nodes, failing to reflect the interactions among nodes. In this paper, we introduce a new challenging task to model the interactions of OOD nodes in a graph, termed spreading OOD detection, where a newly emerged OOD node spreads its property to neighboring nodes. We curate realistic benchmarks by employing the epidemic spreading models that simulate the spreading of OOD nodes on the graph. We also showcase a ``Spreading COVID-19"" dataset to demonstrate the applicability of spreading OOD detection in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, to effectively detect spreading OOD samples under the proposed benchmark setup, we present a new approach called energy distribution-based detector (EDBD), which includes a novel energy-aggregation scheme. EDBD is designed to mitigate undesired mixing of OOD scores between in-distribution (ID) and OOD nodes. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods in both spreading OOD detection and conventional node-level OOD detection tasks across seven benchmark datasets.

Poster,Spread Preference Annotation: Direct Preference Judgment for Efficient LLM Alignment,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30572,"Dongyoung Kim, Kimin Lee, Jinwoo Shin, Jaehyung Kim","Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences becomes a key component to obtaining state-of-the-art performance, but it yields a huge cost to construct a large human-annotated preference dataset. To tackle this problem, we propose a new framework, Spread Preference Annotation with direct preference judgment (SPA), that boosts the alignment of LLMs using only a very small amount of human-annotated preference data.Our key idea is leveraging the human prior knowledge within the small (seed) data and progressively improving the alignment of LLM, by iteratively generating the responses and learning from them with the self-annotated preference data.To be specific, we propose to derive the preference label from the logits of LLM to explicitly extract the model's inherent preference. Compared to the previous approaches using external reward models or implicit in-context learning, we observe that the proposed approach is significantly more effective.In addition, we introduce a noise-aware preference learning algorithm to mitigate the risk of low quality within generated preference data.Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly boosts the alignment of LLMs.For example, we achieve superior alignment performance on AlpacaEval 2.0 with only 3.3% of the ground-truth preference labels in the Ultrafeedback data compared to the cases using the entire data or state-of-the-art baselines."
Poster,Spurious Forgetting in Continual Learning of Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29593,"Junhao Zheng, Xidi Cai, Shengjie Qiu, Qianli Ma","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) reveal a perplexing phenomenon in continual learning: despite extensive training, models experience significant performance declines, raising questions about task alignment and underlying knowledge retention. This study first explores the concept of ""spurious forgetting"", proposing that such performance drops often reflect a decline in task alignment rather than true knowledge loss. Through controlled experiments with a synthesized dataset, we investigate the dynamics of model performance during the initial training phases of new tasks, discovering that early optimization steps can disrupt previously established task alignments. Our theoretical analysis connects these shifts to orthogonal updates in model weights, providing a robust framework for understanding this behavior. Ultimately, we introduce a Freezing strategy that fix the bottom layers of the model, leading to substantial improvements in four continual learning scenarios. Our findings underscore the critical distinction between task alignment and knowledge retention, paving the way for more effective strategies in continual learning."
Poster,SqueezeAttention: 2D Management of KV-Cache in LLM Inference via Layer-wise Optimal Budget,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30707,"Zihao Wang, Bin CUI, Shaoduo Gan","Optimizing the Key-Value (KV) cache of the Large Language Model (LLM) has been considered critical to saving the cost of inference. Most of the existing KV-cache compression algorithms attempted to sparsify the sequence of tokens by taking advantage of the different importance of tokens. However, most of these methods treat all layers equally, allocating the same KV budget to each layer. This approach is suboptimal, as some layers may be less sensitive to input tokens yet still receive the same budget as others. In this work, we found that by identifying the importance of attention layers, we could optimize the KV-cache jointly from two dimensions, i.e., sequence-wise and layer-wise. Based on our observations regarding layer-wise importance in inference, we propose \sys to precisely optimize the allocation of KV-cache budget among layers on-the-fly and then incorporate three representative sequence-wise algorithms to compress the KV-cache for each layer with its very own budget. Specifically, we first measure each layer's importance by calculating the cosine similarity of the input prompt differences before and after the self-attention layers. Based on this similarity, we then categorize the layers into two groups and adjust their KV budgets accordingly. By optimizing the KV-cache from both sequence's and layer's dimensions, \sys achieves around 30\% to 70\% of the memory reductions and up to 2.2 $\times$ of throughput improvements in a wide range of LLMs and benchmarks.
