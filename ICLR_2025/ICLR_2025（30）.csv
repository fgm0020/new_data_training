Poster,Audio Large Language Models Can Be Descriptive Speech Quality Evaluators,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29492,"CHEN CHEN, Yuchen Hu, Siyin Wang, Helin Wang, Zhehuai Chen, Chao Zhang, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Ensiong Chng","An ideal multimodal agent should be aware of the quality of its input modalities. Recent advances have enabled large language models (LLMs) to incorporate auditory systems for handling various speech-related tasks. However, most audio LLMs remain unaware of the quality of the speech they process. This limitation arises because speech quality evaluation is typically excluded from multi-task training due to the lack of suitable datasets. To address this, we introduce the first natural language-based speech evaluation corpus, generated from authentic human ratings. In addition to the overall Mean Opinion Score (MOS), this corpus offers detailed analysis across multiple dimensions and identifies causes of quality degradation. It also enables descriptive comparisons between two speech samples (A/B tests) with human-like judgment. Leveraging this corpus, we propose an alignment approach with LLM distillation (ALLD) to guide the audio LLM in extracting relevant information from raw speech and generating meaningful responses. Experimental results demonstrate that ALLD outperforms the previous state-of-the-art regression model in MOS prediction, with a mean square error of 0.17 and an A/B test accuracy of 98.6%. Additionally, the generated responses achieve BLEU scores of 25.8 and 30.2 on two tasks, surpassing the capabilities of task-specific models. This work advances the comprehensive perception of speech signals by audio LLMs, contributing to the development of real-world auditory and sensory intelligent agents."
Poster,AugKD: Ingenious Augmentations Empower Knowledge Distillation for Image Super-Resolution,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30646,"Yun Zhang, Wei Li, Simiao Li, Hanting Chen, Zhijun Tu, Bingyi Jing, Shaohui Lin, Jie Hu, Wenjia Wang","Knowledge distillation (KD) compresses deep neural networks by transferring task-related knowledge from cumbersome pre-trained teacher models to more compact student models. However, vanilla KD for image super-resolution (SR) networks yields only limited improvements due to the inherent nature of SR tasks, where the outputs of teacher models are noisy approximations of high-quality label images. In this work, we show that the potential of vanilla KD has been underestimated and demonstrate that the ingenious application of data augmentation methods can close the gap between it and more complex, well-designed methods. Unlike conventional training processes typically applying image augmentations simultaneously to both low-quality inputs and high-quality labels, we propose AugKD utilizing unpaired data augmentations to 1) generate auxiliary distillation samples and 2) impose label consistency regularization. Comprehensive experiments show that the AugKD significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art KD methods across a range of SR tasks."
Poster,A Unified Framework for Forward and Inverse Problems in Subsurface Imaging using Latent Space Translations,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27736,"Naveen Gupta, Medha Sawhney, Arka Daw, Youzuo Lin, Anuj Karpatne","In subsurface imaging, learning the mapping from velocity maps to seismic waveforms (forward problem) and waveforms to velocity (inverse problem) is important for several applications. While traditional techniques for solving forward and inverse problems are computationally prohibitive, there is a growing interest to leverage recent advances in deep learning to learn the mapping between velocity maps and seismic waveform images directly from data. Despite the variety of architectures explored in previous works, several open questions still remain unanswered such as the effect of latent space sizes, the importance of manifold learning, the complexity of translation models, and the value of jointly solving forward and inverse problems. We propose a unified framework to systematically characterize prior research in this area termed the Generalized Forward-Inverse (GFI) framework, building on the assumption of manifolds and latent space translations. We show that GFI encompasses previous works in deep learning for subsurface imaging, which can be viewed as specific instantiations of GFI. We also propose two new model architectures within the framework of GFI: Latent U-Net and Invertible X-Net, leveraging the power of U-Nets for domain translation and the ability of IU-Nets to simultaneously learn forward and inverse translations, respectively. We show that our proposed models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for forward and inverse problems on a wide range of synthetic datasets, and also investigate their zero-shot effectiveness on two real-world-like datasets.

Poster,A Unified Theory of Quantum Neural Network Loss Landscapes,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28843,Eric Anschuetz,"Classical neural networks with random initialization famously behave as Gaussian processes in the limit of many neurons, which allows one to completely characterize their training and generalization behavior. No such general understanding exists for quantum neural networks (QNNs), which—outside of certain special cases—are known to not behave as Gaussian processes when randomly initialized. We here prove that QNNs and their first two derivatives instead generally form what we call ""Wishart processes,"" where certain algebraic properties of the network determine the hyperparameters of the process. This Wishart process description allows us to, for the first time: give necessary and sufficient conditions for a QNN architecture to have a Gaussian process limit; calculate the full gradient distribution, generalizing previously known barren plateau results; and calculate the local minima distribution of algebraically constrained QNNs. Our unified framework suggests a certain simple operational definition for the ""trainability"" of a given QNN model using a newly introduced, experimentally accessible quantity we call the ""degrees of freedom"" of the network architecture."
Poster,A Unifying Framework for Representation Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29352,"Shaden Alshammari, John Hershey, Axel Feldmann, William Freeman, Mark Hamilton","As the field of representation learning grows, there has been a proliferation of different loss functions to solve different classes of problems. We introduce a single information-theoretic equation that generalizes a large collection of mod- ern loss functions in machine learning. In particular, we introduce a framework that shows that several broad classes of machine learning methods are precisely minimizing an integrated KL divergence between two conditional distributions: the supervisory and learned representations. This viewpoint exposes a hidden information geometry underlying clustering, spectral methods, dimensionality re- duction, contrastive learning, and supervised learning. This framework enables the development of new loss functions by combining successful techniques from across the literature. We not only present a wide array of proofs, connecting over 23 different approaches, but we also leverage these theoretical results to create state-of-the-art unsupervised image classifiers that achieve a +8% improvement over the prior state-of-the-art on unsupervised classification on ImageNet-1K. We also demonstrate that I-Con can be used to derive principled debiasing methods which improve contrastive representation learners."
Poster,"AuroraCap: Efficient, Performant Video Detailed Captioning and a New Benchmark",https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28051,"Wenhao Chai, Enxin Song, Yilun Du, Chenlin Meng, Vashisht Madhavan, Omer Bar-Tal, Jenq-Neng Hwang, Saining Xie, Christopher Manning","Video detailed captioning is a key task which aims to generate comprehensive and coherent textual descriptions of video content, benefiting both video understanding and generation. In this paper, we propose AuroraCap, a video captioner based on a large multimodal model. We follow the simplest architecture design without additional parameters for temporal modeling. To address the overhead caused by lengthy video sequences, we implement the token merging strategy, reducing the number of input visual tokens. Surprisingly, we found that this strategy results in little performance loss. AuroraCap shows superior performance on various video and image captioning benchmarks, for example, obtaining a CIDEr of 88.9 on Flickr30k, beating GPT-4V (55.3) and Gemini-1.5 Pro (82.2). However, existing video caption benchmarks only include simple descriptions, consisting of a few dozen words, which limits research in this field. Therefore, we develop VDC, a video detailed captioning benchmark with over one thousand carefully annotated structured captions. In addition, we propose a new LLM-assisted metric VDCscore for bettering evaluation, which adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy to transform long caption evaluation into multiple short question-answer pairs. With the help of human Elo ranking, our experiments show that this benchmark better correlates with human judgments of video detailed captioning quality."
Poster,AutoBencher: Towards Declarative Benchmark Construction,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27700,"XIANG LI, Farzaan Kaiyom, Evan Liu, Yifan Mai, Percy Liang, Tatsunori Hashimoto","We present AutoBencher, a declarative framework for automatic benchmark construction, and use it to scalably discover novel insights and vulnerabilities of existing language models. Concretely, given a few desiderata of benchmarks (e.g., question difficulty, topic salience), we operationalize each desideratum and cast benchmark creation as an optimization problem. Specifically, we experiment with two settings with different optimization objectives: (i) for capability evaluation, we declare the goal of finding a salient, difficult dataset that induces novel performance patterns; (ii) for safety evaluation, we declare the goal of finding a dataset of unsafe prompts that existing LMs fail to decline. To tackle this optimization problem, we use a language model to iteratively propose and refine dataset descriptions, which are then used to generate topic-specific questions and answers. These descriptions are optimized to improve the declared desiderata. We use AutoBencher (powered by GPT-4) to create datasets for math, multilinguality, knowledge, and safety. The scalability of AutoBencher allows it to test fine-grained categories and tail knowledge, creating datasets that elicit 22% more model errors (i.e., difficulty) than existing benchmarks. On the novelty ends, AutoBencher also helps identify specific gaps not captured by existing benchmarks: e.g., Gemini-Pro has knowledge gaps on Permian Extinction and Fordism while GPT-4o fails to decline harmful requests about cryptocurrency scams."
Poster,AutoCGP: Closed-Loop Concept-Guided Policies from Unlabeled Demonstrations,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30674,"Pei Zhou, Ruizhe Liu, Qian Luo, Fan Wang, Yibing Song, Yanchao Yang","Training embodied agents to perform complex robotic tasks presents significant challenges due to the entangled factors of task compositionality, environmental diversity, and dynamic changes. In this work, we introduce a novel imitation learning framework to train closed-loop concept-guided policies that enhance long-horizon task performance by leveraging discovered manipulation concepts. Unlike methods that rely on predefined skills and human-annotated labels, our approach allows agents to autonomously abstract manipulation concepts from their proprioceptive states, thereby alleviating misalignment due to ambiguities in human semantics and environmental complexity. Our framework comprises two primary components: an *Automatic Concept Discovery* module that identifies meaningful and consistent manipulation concepts, and a *Concept-Guided Policy Learning* module that effectively utilizes these manipulation concepts for adaptive task execution, including a *Concept Selection Transformer* for concept-based guidance and a *Concept-Guided Policy* for action prediction with the selected concepts. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods across a range of tasks and environments, while showcasing emergent consistency in motion patterns associated with the discovered manipulation concepts. Codes are available at: https://github.com/PeiZhou26/AutoCGP."
Poster,AutoCLIP: Auto-tuning Zero-Shot Classifiers for Vision-Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31476,"Jan Metzen, Piyapat Saranrittichai, Chaithanya Kumar Mummadi","Classifiers built upon vision-language models such as CLIP have shown remarkable zero-shot performance across a broad range of image classification tasks. Prior work has studied different ways of automatically creating descriptor sets for every class based on prompt templates, ranging from manually engineered templates over templates obtained from a large language model to templates built from random words and characters. Up until now, deriving zero-shot classifiers from the respective encoded class descriptors has remained nearly unchanged, i.e., classify to the class that maximizes cosine similarity between its averaged encoded class descriptors and the image encoding. However, weighing all class descriptors equally can be suboptimal when certain descriptors match visual clues on a given image better than others. In this work, we propose AutoCLIP, a method for auto-tuning zero-shot classifiers. AutoCLIP tunes per-image weights to each prompt template at inference time, based on statistics of class descriptor-image similarities. AutoCLIP is fully unsupervised, has only a minor additional computation overhead, and can be easily implemented in few lines of code. We show that AutoCLIP outperforms baselines across a broad range of vision-language models, datasets, and prompt templates consistently and by up to 3 percent point accuracy."
Poster,Autocorrelation Matters: Understanding the Role of Initialization Schemes for State Space Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28120,"Fusheng Liu, Qianxiao Li","Current methods for initializing state space model (SSM) parameters primarily rely on the HiPPO framework \citep{gu2023how}, which is based on online function approximation with the SSM kernel basis. However, the HiPPO framework does not explicitly account for the effects of the temporal structures of input sequences on the optimization of SSMs.In this paper, we take a further step to investigate the roles of SSM initialization schemes by considering the autocorrelation of input sequences. Specifically, we: (1) rigorously characterize the dependency of the SSM timescale on sequence length based on sequence autocorrelation; (2) find that with a proper timescale, allowing a zero real part for the eigenvalues of the SSM state matrix mitigates the curse of memory while still maintaining stability at initialization; (3) show that the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the SSM state matrix determines the conditioning of SSM optimization problems, and uncover an approximation-estimation tradeoff when training SSMs with a specific class of target functions."
