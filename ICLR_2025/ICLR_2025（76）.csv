Poster,Data Selection via Optimal Control for Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28972,"Yuxian Gu, Li Dong, Hongning Wang, Yaru Hao, Qingxiu Dong, Furu Wei, Minlie Huang","This work investigates the selection of high-quality pre-training data from massive corpora to enhance LMs' capabilities for downstream usage. We formulate data selection as a generalized Optimal Control problem, which can be solved theoretically by Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP), yielding a set of necessary conditions that characterize the relationship between optimal data selection and LM training dynamics.Based on these theoretical results, we introduce **P**MP-based **D**ata **S**election (**PDS**), a framework that approximates optimal data selection by solving the PMP conditions. In our experiments, we adopt PDS to select data from CommmonCrawl and show that the PDS-selected corpus accelerates the learning of LMs and constantly boosts their performance on a wide range of downstream tasks across various model sizes.Moreover, the benefits of PDS extend to ~400B models trained on ~10T tokens, as evidenced by the extrapolation of the test loss curves according to the Scaling Laws.PDS also improves data utilization when the pre-training data is limited, by reducing the data demand by 1.8 times, which helps mitigate the quick exhaustion of available web-crawled corpora.

Poster,Dataset Distillation via Knowledge Distillation: Towards Efficient Self-Supervised Pre-training of Deep Networks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29070,"Siddharth Joshi, Jiayi Ni, Baharan Mirzasoleiman","Dataset distillation (DD) generates small synthetic datasets that can efficiently train deep networks with a limited amount of memory and compute. Despite the success of DD methods for supervised learning, DD for self-supervised pre-training of deep models has remained unaddressed. Pre-training on unlabeled data is crucial for efficiently generalizing to downstream tasks with limited labeled data. In this work, we propose the first effective DD method for SSL pre-training. First, we show, theoretically and empirically, that naiive application of supervised DD methods to SSL fails, due to the high variance of the SSL gradient. Then, we address this issue by relying on insights from knowledge distillation (KD) literature. Specifically, we train a small student model to match the representations of a larger teacher model trained with SSL. Then, we generate a small synthetic dataset by matching the training trajectories of the student models. As the KD objective has considerably lower variance than SSL, our approach can generate synthetic datasets that can successfully pre-train high-quality encoders. Through extensive experiments, we show that our distilled sets lead to up to 13% higher accuracy than prior work, on a variety of downstream tasks, in the presence of limited labeled data.

Poster,Dataset Ownership Verification in Contrastive Pre-trained Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27659,"Yuechen Xie, Jie Song, Mengqi Xue, Haofei Zhang, Xingen Wang, Bingde Hu, Genlang Chen, Mingli Song","High-quality open-source datasets, which necessitate substantial efforts for curation, has become the primary catalyst for the swift progress of deep learning. Concurrently, protecting these datasets is paramount for the well-being of the data owner. Dataset ownership verification emerges as a crucial method in this domain, but existing approaches are often limited to supervised models and cannot be directly extended to increasingly popular unsupervised pre-trained models. In this work, we propose the first dataset ownership verification method tailored specifically for self-supervised pre-trained models by contrastive learning. Its primary objective is to ascertain whether a suspicious black-box backbone has been pre-trained on a specific unlabeled dataset, aiding dataset owners in upholding their rights. The proposed approach is motivated by our empirical insights that when models are trained with the target dataset, the unary and binary instance relationships within the embedding space exhibit significant variations compared to models trained without the target dataset. We validate the efficacy of this approach across multiple contrastive pre-trained models including SimCLR, BYOL, SimSiam, MOCO v3, and DINO. The results demonstrate that our method rejects the null hypothesis with a $p$-value markedly below $0.05$, surpassing all previous methodologies.

Poster,Data Shapley in One Training Run,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30239,"Jiachen (Tianhao) Wang, Prateek Mittal, Dawn Song, Ruoxi Jia","Data Shapley offers a principled framework for attributing the contribution of data within machine learning contexts. However, the traditional notion of Data Shapley requires re-training models on various data subsets, which becomes computationally infeasible for large-scale models. Additionally, this retraining-based definition cannot evaluate the contribution of data for a specific model training run, which may often be of interest in practice. This paper introduces a novel concept, In-Run Data Shapley, which eliminates the need for model retraining and is specifically designed for assessing data contribution for a particular model of interest. In-Run Data Shapley calculates the Shapley value for each gradient update iteration and accumulates these values throughout the training process. We present several techniques that allow the efficient scaling of In-Run Data Shapley to the size of foundation models. In its most optimized implementation, our method adds negligible runtime overhead compared to standard model training. This dramatic efficiency improvement makes it possible to perform data attribution for the foundation model pretraining stage. We present several case studies that offer fresh insights into pretraining data's contribution and discuss their implications for copyright in generative AI and pretraining data curation."
Poster,Data Taggants: Dataset Ownership Verification Via Harmless Targeted Data Poisoning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30866,"Wassim Bouaziz, Nicolas Usunier, El-Mahdi El-Mhamdi","Dataset ownership verification, the process of determining if a dataset is used in a model's training data, is necessary for detecting unauthorized data usage and data contamination.Existing approaches, such as backdoor watermarking, rely on inducing a detectable behavior into the trained model on a part of the data distribution.However, these approaches have limitations, as they can be harmful to the model's performances or require unpractical access to the model's internals.Most importantly, previous approaches lack guarantee against false positives.\This paper introduces *data taggants*, a novel non-backdoor dataset ownership verification technique.Our method uses pairs of out-of-distribution samples and random labels as secret *keys*, and leverages clean-label targeted data poisoning to subtly alter a dataset, so that models trained on it respond to the key samples with the corresponding key labels.The keys are built as to allow for statistical certificates with black-box access only to the model.\We validate our approach through comprehensive and realistic experiments on ImageNet1k using ViT and ResNet models with state-of-the-art training recipes.Our findings demonstrate that data taggants can reliably detect  models trained on the protected dataset with high confidence, without compromising validation accuracy, and show their superiority over backdoor watermarking.We demonstrate the stealthiness and robustness of our method% shows to be stealthy and robustagainst various defense mechanisms."
Poster,Data Unlearning in Diffusion Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29573,"Silas Alberti, Kenan Hasanaliyev, Manav Shah, Stefano Ermon","Recent work has shown that diffusion models memorize and reproduce training data examples. At the same time, large copyright lawsuits and legislation such as GDPR have highlighted the need for erasing datapoints from diffusion models. However, retraining from scratch is often too expensive. This motivates the setting of data unlearning, i.e., the study of efficient techniques for unlearning specific datapoints from the training set. Existing concept unlearning techniques require an anchor prompt/class/distribution to guide unlearning, which is not available in the data unlearning setting. General-purpose machine unlearning techniques were found to be either unstable or failed to unlearn data. We therefore propose a family of new loss functions called Subtracted Importance Sampled Scores (SISS) that utilize importance sampling and are the first method to unlearn data with theoretical guarantees. SISS is constructed as a weighted combination between simpler objectives that are responsible for preserving model quality and unlearning the targeted datapoints. When evaluated on CelebA-HQ and MNIST, SISS achieved Pareto optimality along the quality and unlearning strength dimensions. On Stable Diffusion, SISS successfully mitigated memorization on nearly 90% of the prompts we tested. We release our code online."
Poster,DaWin: Training-free Dynamic Weight Interpolation for Robust Adaptation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30016,"Changdae Oh, Yixuan Li, Kyungwoo Song, Sangdoo Yun, Dongyoon Han","Adapting a pre-trained foundation model on downstream tasks should ensure robustness against distribution shifts without the need to retrain the whole model. Although existing weight interpolation methods are simple yet effective, we argue their static nature limits downstream performance while achieving efficiency. In this work, we propose DaWin, a training-free dynamic weight interpolation method that leverages the entropy of individual models over each unlabeled test sample to assess model expertise, and compute per-sample interpolation coefficients dynamically. Unlike previous works that typically rely on additional training to learn such coefficients, our approach requires no training. Then, we propose a mixture modeling approach that greatly reduces inference overhead raised by dynamic interpolation. We validate DaWin on the large-scale visual recognition benchmarks, spanning 14 tasks across robust fine-tuning -- ImageNet and derived five distribution shift benchmarks -- and multi-task learning with eight classification tasks. Results demonstrate that DaWin achieves significant performance gain in considered settings, with minimal computational overhead. We further discuss DaWin's analytic behavior to explain its empirical success."
Poster,DAWN: Dynamic Frame Avatar with Non-autoregressive Diffusion Framework for Talking head Video Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27895,"Hanbo Cheng, Limin Lin, Chenyu Liu, Pengcheng Xia, Pengfei Hu, Jiefeng Ma, Jun Du, Jia Pan","Talking head generation intends to produce vivid and realistic talking head videos from a single portrait and speech audio clip. Although significant progress has been made in diffusion-based talking head generation, almost all methods rely on autoregressive strategies, which suffer from limited context utilization beyond the current generation step, error accumulation, and slower generation speed. To address these challenges, we present DAWN (\textbf{D}ynamic frame \textbf{A}vatar \textbf{W}ith \textbf{N}on-autoregressive diffusion), a framework that enables all-at-once generation of dynamic-length video sequences. Specifically, it consists of two main components:  (1) audio-driven holistic facial dynamics generation in the latent motion space, and (2) audio-driven head pose and blink generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates authentic and vivid videos with precise lip motions, and natural pose/blink movements. Additionally, with a high generation speed, DAWN possesses strong extrapolation capabilities, ensuring the stable production of high-quality long videos. These results highlight the considerable promise and potential impact of DAWN in the field of talking head video generation. Furthermore, we hope that DAWN sparks further exploration of non-autoregressive approaches in diffusion models. Our code will be publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Hanbo-Cheng/DAWN-pytorch}."
Poster,DCT-CryptoNets: Scaling Private Inference in the Frequency Domain,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28520,"Arjun Roy, Kaushik Roy","The convergence of fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) and machine learning offers unprecedented opportunities for private inference of sensitive data. FHE enables computation directly on encrypted data, safeguarding the entire machine learning pipeline, including data and model confidentiality. However, existing FHE-based implementations for deep neural networks face significant challenges in computational cost, latency, and scalability, limiting their practical deployment. This paper introduces DCT-CryptoNets, a novel approach that operates directly in the frequency-domain to reduce the burden of computationally expensive non-linear activations and homomorphic bootstrap operations during private inference. It does so by utilizing the discrete cosine transform (DCT), commonly employed in JPEG encoding, which has inherent compatibility with remote computing services where images are generally stored and transmitted in this encoded format. DCT-CryptoNets demonstrates a substantial latency reductions of up to 5.3$\times$ compared to prior work on benchmark image classification tasks. Notably, it demonstrates inference on the ImageNet dataset within 2.5 hours (down from 12.5 hours on equivalent 96-thread compute resources). Furthermore, by *learning* perceptually salient low-frequency information DCT-CryptoNets improves the reliability of encrypted predictions compared to RGB-based networks by reducing error accumulating homomorphic bootstrap operations. DCT-CryptoNets also demonstrates superior scalability to RGB-based networks by further reducing computational cost as image size increases. This study demonstrates a promising avenue for achieving efficient and practical private inference of deep learning models on high resolution images seen in real-world applications."
Poster,DebGCD: Debiased Learning with Distribution Guidance for Generalized Category Discovery,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30717,"Yuanpei Liu, Kai Han","In this paper, we tackle the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD). Given a dataset containing both labelled and unlabelled images, the objective is to categorize all images in the unlabelled subset, irrespective of whether they are from known or unknown classes. In GCD, an inherent label bias exists between known and unknown classes due to the lack of ground-truth labels for the latter. State-of-the-art methods in GCD leverage parametric classifiers trained through self-distillation with soft labels, leaving the bias issue unattended. Besides, they treat all unlabelled samples uniformly, neglecting variations in certainty levels and resulting in suboptimal learning. Moreover, the explicit identification of semantic distribution shifts between known and unknown classes, a vital aspect for effective GCD, has been neglected. To address these challenges, we introduce DebGCD, a Debiased learning with distribution guidance framework for GCD. Initially, DebGCD co-trains an auxiliary debiased classifier in the same feature space as the GCD classifier, progressively enhancing the GCD features. Moreover, we introduce a semantic distribution detector in a separate feature space to implicitly boost the learning efficacy of GCD. Additionally, we employ a curriculum learning strategy based on semantic distribution certainty to steer the debiased learning at an optimized pace. Thorough evaluations on GCD benchmarks demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of our framework, highlighting its superiority.
