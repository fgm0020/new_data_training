Poster,An Engorgio Prompt Makes Large Language Model Babble on,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28485,"Jianshuo Dong, Ziyuan Zhang, Qingjie Zhang, Tianwei Zhang, Hao Wang, Hewu Li, Qi Li, Chao Zhang, Ke Xu, Han Qiu","Auto-regressive large language models (LLMs) have yielded impressive performance in many real-world tasks. However, the new paradigm of these LLMs also exposes novel threats. In this paper, we explore their vulnerability to inference cost attacks, where a malicious user crafts Engorgio prompts to intentionally increase the computation cost and latency of the inference process. We design Engorgio, a novel methodology, to efficiently generate adversarial Engorgio prompts to affect the target LLM's service availability. Engorgio has the following two technical contributions. (1) We employ a parameterized distribution to track LLMs' prediction trajectory. (2) Targeting the auto-regressive nature of LLMs' inference process, we propose novel loss functions to stably suppress the appearance of the <EOS> token, whose occurrence will interrupt the LLM's generation process. We conduct extensive experiments on 13 open-sourced LLMs with parameters ranging from 125M to 30B. The results show that Engorgio prompts can successfully induce LLMs to generate abnormally long outputs (i.e., roughly 2-13$\times$ longer to reach 90\%+ of the output length limit)in a white-box scenario and our real-world experiment demonstrates Engergio's threat to LLM service with limited computing resources.The code is released at https://github.com/jianshuod/Engorgio-prompt."
Poster,An Evolved Universal Transformer Memory,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28152,"Edoardo Cetin, Qi Sun, Tianyu Zhao, Yujin Tang","Prior methods propose to offset the escalating costs of modern foundation models by dropping specific parts of their contexts with hand-designed rules, while attempting to preserve their original performance. We overcome this trade-off with Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs), introducing a learned network for memory management that improves both the performance and efficiency of transformers. We evolve NAMMs atop pre-trained transformers to provide different latent contexts focusing on the most relevant information for individual layers and attention heads. NAMMs are universally applicable to any model using self-attention as they condition exclusively on the values in the produced attention matrices. Learning NAMMs on a small set of problems, we achieve substantial performance improvements across multiple long-context benchmarks while cutting the model's input contexts up to a fraction of the original sizes. We show the generality of our conditioning enables zero-shot transfer of NAMMs trained only on language to entirely new transformer architectures even across input modalities, with their benefits carrying over to vision and reinforcement learning."
Poster,A new framework for evaluating model out-of-distribution generalisation for the biochemical domain,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28260,"Raul Fernandez-Diaz, Hoang Thanh Lam, Vanessa Lopez, Denis Shields","Quantifying model generalization to out-of-distribution data has been a longstanding challenge in machine learning. Addressing this issue is crucial for leveraging machine learning in scientific discovery, where models must generalize to new molecules or materials. Current methods typically split data into train and test sets using various criteria — temporal, sequence identity, scaffold, or random cross-validation — before evaluating model performance. However, with so many splitting criteria available, existing approaches offer limited guidance on selecting the most appropriate one, and they do not provide mechanisms for incorporating prior knowledge about the target deployment distribution(s).To tackle this problem, we have developed a novel metric, AU-GOOD, which quantifies expected model performance under conditions of increasing dissimilarity between train and test sets, while also accounting for prior knowledge about the target deployment distribution(s), when available. This metric is broadly applicable to biochemical entities, including proteins, small molecules, nucleic acids, or cells; as long as a relevant similarity function is defined for them. Recognizing the wide range of similarity functions used in biochemistry, we propose criteria to guide the selection of the most appropriate metric for partitioning. We also introduce a new partitioning algorithm that generates more challenging test sets, and we propose statistical methods for comparing models based on AU-GOOD.Finally, we demonstrate the insights that can be gained from this framework by applying it to two different use cases: developing predictors for pharmaceutical properties of small molecules, and using protein language models as embeddings to build biophysical property predictors."
Poster,A New Perspective on Shampoo's Preconditioner,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29069,"Depen Morwani, Itai Shapira, Nikhil Vyas, Eran Malach, Sham Kakade, Lucas Janson","Shampoo, a second-order optimization algorithm that uses a Kronecker product preconditioner, has recently received increasing attention from the machine learning community. Despite the increasing popularity of Shampoo, the theoretical foundations of its effectiveness are not well understood. The preconditioner used by Shampoo can be viewed as either an approximation of the Gauss--Newton component of the Hessian or the covariance matrix of the gradients maintained by Adagrad. Our key contribution is providing an explicit and novel connection between the optimal Kronecker product approximation of these matrices and the approximationmade by Shampoo. Our connection highlights a subtle but common misconception about Shampoo’s approximation. In particular, the square of the approximation used by the Shampoo optimizer is equivalent to a single step of the poweriteration algorithm for computing the aforementioned optimal Kronecker product approximation. Across a variety of datasets and architectures we empiricallydemonstrate that this is close to the optimal Kronecker product approximation. We also study the impact of batch gradients and empirical Fisher on the quality of Hessian approximation. Our findings not only advance the theoretical understanding of Shampoo but also illuminate potential pathways for enhancing its practical performance."
Poster,An Exploration with Entropy Constrained 3D Gaussians for 2D Video Compression,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30096,"Xiang Liu, Bin Chen, Zimo Liu, Yaowei Wang, Shu-Tao Xia","3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has witnessed its rapid development in novel view synthesis, which attains high quality reconstruction and real-time rendering. At the same time, there is still a gap before implicit neural representation (INR)  can become a practical compressor due to the lack of stream decoding and real-time frame reconstruction on consumer-grade hardware. It remains a question whether the fast rendering and partial parameter decoding characteristics of 3DGS are applicable to video compression. To address these challenges, we propose a Toast-like Sliding Window (TSW) orthographic projection for converting any 3D Gaussian model into a video representation model. This method efficiently represents video by leveraging temporal redundancy through a sliding window approach. Additionally, the converted model is inherently stream-decodable and offers a higher rendering frame rate compared to INR methods. Building on TSW, we introduce an end-to-end trainable video compression method, GSVC, which employs deformable Gaussian representation and optical flow guidance to capture dynamic content in videos. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively transforms a 3D Gaussian model into a practical video compressor.  GSVC further achieves better rate-distortion performance than NeRV on the UVG dataset, while achieving higher frame reconstruction speed (+30%~40% fps) and stream decoding. Code is available at [Github](https://github.com/actcwlf/GSVC)"
Poster,An Illustrated Guide to Automatic Sparse Differentiation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31324,"Adrian Hill, Guillaume Dalle, Alexis Montoison","In numerous applications of machine learning, Hessians and Jacobians exhibit sparsity, a property that can be leveraged to vastly accelerate their computation. While the usage of automatic differentiation in machine learning is ubiquitous, automatic sparse differentiation (ASD) remains largely unknown. This post introduces ASD, explaining its key components and their roles in the computation of both sparse Jacobians and Hessians. We conclude with a practical demonstration showcasing the performance benefits of ASD.___First-order optimization is ubiquitous in machine learning (ML) but second-order optimization is much less common. The intuitive reason is that high-dimensional vectors (gradients) are cheap, whereas high-dimensional matrices (Hessians) are expensive. Luckily, in numerous applications of ML to science or engineering, Hessians and Jacobians exhibit sparsity: most of their coefficients are known to be zero. Leveraging this sparsity can vastly accelerate automatic differentiation (AD) for Hessians and Jacobians, while decreasing its memory requirements. Yet, while traditional AD is available in many high-level programming languages like Python and Julia, automatic sparse differentiation (ASD) is not as widely used. One reason is that the underlying theory was developed outside of the ML research ecosystem, by people more familiar with low-level programming languages.With this blog post, we aim to shed light on the inner workings of ASD, bridging the gap between the ML and AD communities by presenting well established techniques from the latter field. We start out with a short introduction to traditional AD, covering the computation of Jacobians in both forward and reverse mode. We then dive into the two primary components of ASD: sparsity pattern detection and matrix coloring. Having described the computation of sparse Jacobians, we move on to sparse Hessians.We conclude with a practical demonstration of ASD, providing performance benchmarks and guidance on when to use ASD over AD."
Poster,An Image is Worth More Than 16x16 Patches: Exploring Transformers on Individual Pixels,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28029,"Duy-Kien Nguyen, Mahmoud Assran, Unnat Jain, Martin R. Oswald, Cees G Snoek, Xinlei Chen","This work does not introduce a new method. Instead, we present an interesting finding that questions the necessity of the inductive bias of locality in modern computer vision architectures. Concretely, we find that vanilla Transformers can operate by directly treating each individual pixel as a token and achieve highly performant results. This is substantially different from the popular design in Vision Transformer, which maintains the inductive bias from ConvNets towards local neighborhoods (e.g., by treating each 16x16 patch as a token). We showcase the effectiveness of pixels-as-tokens across three well-studied computer vision tasks: supervised learning for classification and regression, self-supervised learning via masked autoencoding, and image generation with diffusion models. Although it's computationally less practical to directly operate on individual pixels, we believe the community must be made aware of this surprising piece of knowledge when devising the next generation of neural network architectures for computer vision."
Poster,Animate-X: Universal Character Image Animation with Enhanced Motion Representation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31209,"Shuai Tan, Biao Gong, Xiang Wang, Shiwei Zhang, DanDan Zheng, Ruobing Zheng, Kecheng Zheng, Jingdong Chen, Ming Yang","Character image animation, which generates high-quality videos from a reference image and target pose sequence, has seen significant progress in recent years. However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which usually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in industries like gaming and entertainment. Our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute this limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to comprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose sequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes $\texttt{Animate-X}$, a universal animation framework based on LDM for various character types (collectively named $\texttt{X}$), including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation, we introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern from the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former leverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of motion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions, while the latter strengthens the generalization of LDM by simulating possible inputs in advance that may arise during inference. Moreover, we introduce a new Animated Anthropomorphic Benchmark ($\texttt{$A^2$Bench}$) to evaluate the performance of $\texttt{Animate-X}$ on universal and widely applicable animation images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of $\texttt{Animate-X}$ compared to state-of-the-art methods."
Poster,Animate Your Thoughts: Reconstruction of Dynamic Natural Vision from Human Brain Activity,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30544,"Yizhuo Lu, Changde Du, Chong Wang, Xuanliu Zhu, Liuyun Jiang, Xujin Li, Huiguang He","Reconstructing human dynamic vision from brain activity is a challenging task with great scientific significance.  Although prior video reconstruction methods have made substantial progress, they still suffer from several limitations, including: (1) difficulty in simultaneously reconciling semantic (e.g. categorical descriptions), structure (e.g. size and color), and consistent motion information (e.g. order of frames); (2) low temporal resolution of fMRI, which poses a challenge in decoding multiple frames of video dynamics from a single fMRI frame; (3) reliance on video generation models, which introduces ambiguity regarding whether the dynamics observed in the reconstructed videos are genuinely derived from fMRI data or are hallucinations from generative model. To overcome these limitations,  we propose a two-stage model named Mind-Animator. During the fMRI-to-feature stage, we decouple semantic, structure, and motion features from fMRI. Specifically, we employ fMRI-vision-language tri-modal contrastive learning to decode semantic feature from fMRI and design a sparse causal attention mechanism for decoding multi-frame video motion features through a next-frame-prediction task. In the feature-to-video stage, these features are integrated into videos using an inflated Stable Diffusion, effectively eliminating external video data interference.  Extensive experiments on multiple video-fMRI datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Comprehensive visualization analyses further elucidate the interpretability of our model from a neurobiological perspective.  Project page: https://mind-animator-design.github.io/."
Poster,An Information Criterion for Controlled Disentanglement of Multimodal Data,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31055,"Chenyu Wang, Sharut Gupta, Xinyi Zhang, Sana Tonekaboni, Stefanie Jegelka, Tommi Jaakkola, Caroline Uhler","Multimodal representation learning seeks to relate and decompose information inherent in multiple modalities. By disentangling modality-specific information from information that is shared across modalities, we can improve interpretability and robustness and enable downstream tasks such as the generation of counterfactual outcomes. Separating the two types of information is challenging since they are often deeply entangled in many real-world applications. We propose $\textbf{Disentangled}$ $\textbf{S}$elf-$\textbf{S}$upervised $\textbf{L}$earning (DisentangledSSL), a novel self-supervised approach for learning disentangled representations. We present a comprehensive analysis of the optimality of each disentangled representation, particularly focusing on the scenario not covered in prior work where the so-called $\textit{Minimum Necessary Information}$ (MNI) point is not attainable. We demonstrate that \algo successfully learns shared and modality-specific features on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets and consistently outperforms baselines on various downstream tasks, including prediction tasks for vision-language data, as well as molecule-phenotype retrieval tasks for biological data."
