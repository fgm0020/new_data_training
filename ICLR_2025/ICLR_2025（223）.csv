Poster,Monitoring Latent World States in Language Models with Propositional Probes,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31228,"Jiahai Feng, Stuart Russell, Jacob Steinhardt","Language models (LMs) are susceptible to bias, sycophancy, backdoors, and other tendencies that lead to unfaithful responses to the input context. Interpreting internal states of LMs could help monitor and correct unfaithful behavior. We hypothesize that LMs faithfully represent their input contexts in a latent world model, and we seek to extract these latent world states as logical propositions. For example, given the input context ``Greg is a nurse. Laura is a physicist.'', we aim to decode the propositions WorksAs(Greg, nurse) and WorksAs(Laura, physicist) from the model's internal activations. To do so we introduce _propositional probes_, which compositionally extract lexical concepts from token activations and bind them into propositions. Key to this is identifying a _binding subspace_ in which bound tokens have high similarity (Greg $\leftrightarrow$ nurse) but unbound ones do not (Greg $\not\leftrightarrow$ physicist). Despite only being trained on linguistically simple English templates, we find that propositional probes generalize to inputs written as short stories and translated to Spanish. Moreover, in three settings where LMs respond unfaithfully to the input context---prompt injections, backdoor attacks, and gender bias--- the decoded propositions remain faithful. This suggests that LMs often encode a faithful world model but decode it unfaithfully, which motivates the search for better interpretability tools for monitoring LMs."
Poster,MonST3R: A Simple Approach for Estimating Geometry in the Presence of Motion,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28524,"Junyi Zhang, Charles Herrmann, Junhwa Hur, Varun Jampani, trevor darrell, Forrester Cole, Deqing Sun, Ming-Hsuan Yang","Estimating geometry from dynamic scenes, where objects move and deform over time, remains a core challenge in computer vision. Current approaches often rely on multi-stage pipelines or global optimizations that decompose the problem into subtasks, like depth and flow, leading to complex systems prone to errors. In this paper, we present Motion DUSt3R (MonST3R), a novel geometry-first approachthat directly estimates per-timestep geometry from dynamic scenes. Our key insight is that by simply estimating a pointmap for each timestep, we can effectively adapt DUSt3R’s representation, previously only used for static scenes, to dynamic scenes. However, this approach presents a significant challenge: the scarcity of suitable training data, namely dynamic, posed videos with depth labels. Despite this, we show that by posing the problem as a fine-tuning task, identifying several suitable datasets, and strategically training the model on this limited data, we can surprisingly enable the model to handle dynamics, even without an explicit motion representation. Based on this, we introduce new optimizations for several downstream video-specific tasks and demonstrate strong performance on video depth and camera pose estimation, outperforming prior work in terms of robustness and efficiency. Moreover, MonST3R shows promising results for primarily feed-forward 4D reconstruction. Interactive 4D results, source code, and trained models are available at: https://monst3r-project.github.io/."
Poster,Monte Carlo Planning with Large Language Model for Text-Based Game Agents,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28224,"Zijing Shi, Meng Fang, Ling Chen","Text-based games provide valuable environments for language-based autonomous agents. However, planning-then-learning paradigms, such as those combining Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and reinforcement learning (RL), are notably time-consuming due to extensive iterations. Additionally, these algorithms perform uncertainty-driven exploration but lack language understanding and reasoning abilities.In this paper, we introduce the Monte Carlo planning with Dynamic Memory-guided Large language model (MC-DML) algorithm. MC-DML leverages the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) alongside the exploratory advantages of tree search algorithms. Specifically, we enhance LLMs with in-trial and cross-trial memory mechanisms, enabling them to learn from past experiences and dynamically adjust action evaluations during planning. We conduct experiments on a series of text-based games from the Jericho benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the MC-DML algorithm significantly enhances performance across various games at the initial planning phase, outperforming strong contemporary methods that require multiple iterations. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithm, paving the way for more efficient language-grounded planning in complex environments."
Poster,Montessori-Instruct: Generate Influential Training Data Tailored for Student Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30692,"Xiaochuan Li, Zichun Yu, Chenyan Xiong","Synthetic data has been widely used to train large language models, but their generative nature inevitably introduces noisy, non-informative, and misleading learning signals. In this paper, we propose Montessori-Instruct, a novel data synthesis framework that tailors the data synthesis ability of the teacher language model toward the student language model's learning process. Specifically, we utilize local data influence of synthetic training data points on students to characterize students' learning preferences. Then, we train the teacher model with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to generate synthetic data tailored toward student learning preferences. Experiments with Llama3-8B-Instruct (teacher) and Llama3-8B (student) on Alpaca Eval and MT-Bench demonstrate that Montessori-Instruct significantly outperforms standard synthesis methods by 18.35\% and 46.24\% relatively. Our method also beats data synthesized by a stronger teacher model, GPT-4o. Further analysis confirms the benefits of teacher's learning to generate more influential training data in the student's improved learning, the advantages of local data influence in accurately measuring student preferences, and the robustness of Montessori-Instruct across different student models. Our code and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/cxcscmu/Montessori-Instruct."
Poster,MOOSE-Chem: Large Language Models for Rediscovering Unseen Chemistry Scientific Hypotheses,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29319,"Zonglin Yang, Wanhao Liu, Ben Gao, Tong Xie, Yuqiang Li, Wanli Ouyang, Soujanya Poria, Erik Cambria, Dongzhan Zhou","Scientific discovery contributes largely to the prosperity of human society, and recent progress shows that LLMs could potentially catalyst the process. However, it is still unclear whether LLMs can discover novel and valid hypotheses in chemistry. In this work, we investigate this main research question: whether LLMs can automatically discover novel and valid chemistry research hypotheses, given only a research question? With extensive discussions with chemistry experts, we adopt the assumption that a majority of chemistry hypotheses can be resulted from a research background question and several inspirations. With this key insight, we break the main question into three smaller fundamental questions. In brief, they are: (1) given a background question, whether LLMs can retrieve good inspirations; (2) with background and inspirations, whether LLMs can lead to hypothesis; and (3) whether LLMs can identify good hypotheses to rank them higher. To investigate these questions, we construct a benchmark consisting of 51 chemistry papers published in Nature or a similar level in 2024 (all papers are only available online since 2024). Every paper is divided by chemistry PhD students into three components: background, inspirations, and hypothesis. The goal is to rediscover the hypothesis given only the background and a large chemistry literature corpus consisting the ground truth inspiration papers, with LLMs trained with data up to 2023. We also develop an LLM-based multi-agent framework that leverages the assumption, consisting of three stages reflecting the more smaller questions. The proposed method can rediscover many hypotheses with very high similarity with the ground truth ones, covering the main innovations."
Poster,Moral Alignment for LLM Agents,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29923,"Elizaveta Tennant, Stephen Hailes, Mirco Musolesi","Decision-making agents based on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across various domains of human activity. While their applications are currently rather specialized, several research efforts are underway to develop more generalist agents. As LLM-based systems become more agentic, their influence on human activity will grow and their transparency will decrease. Consequently, developing effective methods for aligning them to human values is vital. The prevailing practice in alignment often relies on human preference data (e.g., in RLHF or DPO), in which values are implicit, opaque and are essentially deduced from relative preferences over different model outputs. In this work, instead of relying on human feedback, we introduce the design of reward functions that explicitly and transparently encode core human values for Reinforcement Learning-based fine-tuning of foundation agent models. Specifically, we use intrinsic rewards for the moral alignment of LLM agents. We evaluate our approach using the traditional philosophical frameworks of Deontological Ethics and Utilitarianism, quantifying moral rewards for agents in terms of actions and consequences on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) environment. We also show how moral fine-tuning can be deployed to enable an agent to unlearn a previously developed selfish strategy. Finally, we find that certain moral strategies learned on the IPD game generalize to several other matrix game environments. In summary, we demonstrate that fine-tuning with intrinsic rewards is a promising general solution for aligning LLM agents to human values, and it might represent a more transparent and cost-effective alternative to currently predominant alignment techniques."
Poster,More Experts Than Galaxies: Conditionally-Overlapping Experts with Biologically-Inspired Fixed Routing,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31179,"Sagi Shaier, Francisco Pereira, Katharina Kann, Lawrence E Hunter, Matt Jones","The evolution of biological neural systems has led to both modularity and sparse coding, which enables energy efficiency and robustness across the diversity of tasks in the lifespan. In contrast, standard neural networks rely on dense, non-specialized architectures, where all model parameters are simultaneously updated to learn multiple tasks, leading to interference. Current sparse neural network approaches aim to alleviate this issue but are hindered by limitations such as 1) trainable gating functions that cause representation collapse, 2) disjoint experts that result in redundant computation and slow learning, and 3) reliance on explicit input or task IDs that limit flexibility and scalability.In this paper we propose Conditionally Overlapping Mixture of ExperTs (COMET), a general deep learning method that addresses these challenges by inducing a modular, sparse architecture with an exponential number of overlapping experts. COMET replaces the trainable gating function used in Sparse Mixture of Experts with a fixed, biologically inspired random projection applied to individual input representations. This design causes the degree of expert overlap to depend on input similarity, so that similar inputs tend to share more parameters. This results in faster learning per update step and improved out-of-sample generalization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of COMET on a range of tasks, including image classification, language modeling, and regression, using several popular deep learning architectures."
Poster,"More RLHF, More Trust? On The Impact of Preference Alignment On Trustworthiness",https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30325,"Aaron J. Li, Satyapriya Krishna, Hima Lakkaraju","The trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the extent to which their outputs are reliable, safe, and ethically aligned, and it has become a crucial consideration alongside their cognitive performance. In practice, Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) has been widely used to align LLMs with labeled human preferences, but its assumed effect on model trustworthiness hasn't been rigorously evaluated. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigates how models aligned with general-purpose preference data perform across five trustworthiness verticals: toxicity, stereotypical bias, machine ethics, truthfulness, and privacy. Our results demonstrate that RLHF on human preferences doesn't automatically guarantee trustworthiness, and reverse effects are often observed. Furthermore, we propose to adapt efficient influence function based data attribution methods to the RLHF setting to better understand the influence of fine-tuning data on individual trustworthiness benchmarks, and show its feasibility by providing our estimated attribution scores. Together, our results underscore the need for more nuanced approaches for model alignment from both the data and framework perspectives, and we hope this research will guide the community towards developing language models that are increasingly capable without sacrificing trustworthiness."
Poster,Morphing Tokens Draw Strong Masked Image Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29006,"Taekyung Kim, Byeongho Heo, Dongyoon Han","Masked image modeling (MIM) has emerged as a promising approach for pre-training Vision Transformers (ViTs). MIMs predict masked tokens token-wise to recover target signals that are tokenized from images or generated by pre-trained models like vision-language models. While using tokenizers or pre-trained models is viable, they often offer spatially inconsistent supervision even for neighboring tokens, hindering models from learning discriminative representations. Our pilot study identifies spatial inconsistency in supervisory signals and suggests that addressing it can improve representation learning. Building upon this insight, we introduce Dynamic Token Morphing (DTM), a novel method that dynamically aggregates tokens while preserving context to generate contextualized targets, thereby likely reducing spatial inconsistency. DTM is compatible with various SSL frameworks; we showcase significantly improved MIM results, barely introducing extra training costs. Our method facilitates MIM training by using more spatially consistent targets, resulting in improved training trends as evidenced by lower losses. Experiments on ImageNet-1K and ADE20K demonstrate DTM's superiority, which surpasses complex state-of-the-art MIM methods. Furthermore, the evaluation of transfer learning on downstream tasks like iNaturalist, along with extensive empirical studies, supports DTM's effectiveness."
Poster,MorphoDiff: Cellular Morphology Painting with Diffusion Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29726,"Zeinab Navidi, Jun Ma, Esteban Miglietta, Le Liu, Anne Carpenter, Beth Cimini, Benjamin Haibe-Kains, BO WANG","Understanding cellular responses to external stimuli is critical for parsing biological mechanisms and advancing therapeutic development. High-content image-based assays provide a cost-effective approach to examine cellular phenotypes induced by diverse interventions, which offers valuable insights into biological processes and cellular states. We introduce MorphoDiff, a generative pipeline to predict high-resolution cell morphological responses under different conditions based on perturbation encoding. To the best of our knowledge, MorphoDiff is the first framework capable of producing guided, high-resolution predictions of cell morphology that generalize across both chemical and genetic interventions. The model integrates perturbation embeddings as guiding signals within a 2D latent diffusion model. The comprehensive computational, biological, and visual validations across three open-source Cell Painting datasets show that MorphoDiff can generate high-fidelity images and produce meaningful biology signals under various interventions. We envision the model will facilitate efficient in silico exploration of perturbational landscapes towards more effective drug discovery studies."
