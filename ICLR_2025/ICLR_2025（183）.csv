Poster,Layout-your-3D: Controllable and Precise 3D Generation with 2D Blueprint,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28437,"Junwei Zhou, Xueting Li, Lu Qi, Ming-Hsuan Yang","We present Layout-Your-3D, a framework that allows controllable and compositional 3D generation from text prompts. Existing text-to-3D methods often struggle to generate assets with plausible object interactions or require tedious optimization processes. To address these challenges, our approach leverages 2D layouts as a blueprint to facilitate precise and plausible control over 3D generation. Starting with a 2D layout provided by a user or generated from a text description, we first create a coarse 3D scene using a carefully designed initialization process based on efficient reconstruction models. To enforce coherent global 3D layouts and enhance the quality of instance appearances, we propose a collision-aware layout optimization process followed by instance-wise refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that Layout-Your-3D yields more reasonable and visually appealing compositional 3D assets while significantly reducing the time required for each prompt. Additionally, Layout-Your-3D can be easily applicable to downstream tasks, such as 3D editing and object insertion."
Poster,LDAdam: Adaptive Optimization from Low-Dimensional Gradient Statistics,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29199,"Thomas Robert, Mher Safaryan, Ionut-Vlad Modoranu, Dan Alistarh","We introduce LDAdam, a memory-efficient optimizer for training large models, that performs adaptive optimization steps within lower dimensional subspaces, while consistently exploring the full parameter space during training. This strategy keeps the optimizer's memory footprint to a fraction of the model size. LDAdam relies on a new projection-aware update rule for the optimizer states that allows for transitioning between subspaces, i.e., estimation of the statistics of the projected gradients. To mitigate the errors due to low-rank projection, LDAdam integrates a new generalized error feedback mechanism, which explicitly accounts for both gradient and optimizer state compression. We prove the convergence of LDAdam under standard assumptions, and provide empirical evidence that LDAdam allows for efficient fine-tuning and pre-training of language models."
Poster,LeanAgent: Lifelong Learning for Formal Theorem Proving,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29455,"Adarsh Kumarappan, Mohit Tiwari, Peiyang Song, Robert Joseph George, Chaowei Xiao, anima anandkumar","Large Language Models (LLMs) have been successful in mathematical reasoning tasks such as formal theorem proving when integrated with interactive proof assistants like Lean. Existing approaches involve training or fine-tuning an LLM on a specific dataset to perform well on particular domains, such as undergraduate-level mathematics. These methods struggle with generalizability to advanced mathematics. A fundamental limitation is that these approaches operate on static domains, failing to capture how mathematicians often work across multiple domains and projects simultaneously or cyclically. We present LeanAgent, a novel lifelong learning framework for formal theorem proving that continuously generalizes to and improves on ever-expanding mathematical knowledge without forgetting previously learned knowledge. LeanAgent introduces several key innovations, including a curriculum learning strategy that optimizes the learning trajectory in terms of mathematical difficulty, a dynamic database for efficient management of evolving mathematical knowledge, and progressive training to balance stability and plasticity. LeanAgent successfully generates formal proofs for 155 theorems across 23 diverse Lean repositories where formal proofs were previously missing, many from advanced mathematics. It performs significantly better than the static LLM baseline, proving challenging theorems in domains like abstract algebra and algebraic topology while showcasing a clear progression of learning from basic concepts to advanced topics. In addition, we analyze LeanAgent's superior performance on key lifelong learning metrics. LeanAgent achieves exceptional scores in stability and backward transfer, where learning new tasks improves performance on previously learned tasks. This emphasizes LeanAgent's continuous generalizability and improvement, explaining its superior theorem-proving performance."
Poster,LeanQuant: Accurate and Scalable Large Language Model Quantization with Loss-error-aware Grid,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30168,"Tianyi Zhang, Anshumali Shrivastava","Large language models (LLMs) have shown immense potential across various domains, but their high memory requirements and inference costs remain critical challenges for deployment. Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a promising technique to reduce memory requirements and decoding latency. However, recent accurate quantization methods often depend on specialized computations or custom data formats to achieve better model quality, which limits their compatibility with popular frameworks, as they require dedicated inference kernels tailored to specific hardware and software platforms, hindering wider adoption. Furthermore, many competitive methods have high resource requirements and computational overhead for quantizing models, making it challenging to scale them to hundreds of billions of parameters. In response to these challenges, we propose LeanQuant (Loss-error-aware network Quantization), a novel quantization method that is accurate, versatile, and scalable. In the existing popular iterative loss-error-based quantization framework, we identify a critical limitation in prior methods: the min-max affine quantization grid fails to preserve model quality due to outliers in inverse Hessian diagonals. To overcome this fundamental issue, we propose learning loss-error-aware grids, instead of using non-adaptive min-max affine grids. Our approach not only produces quantized models that are more accurate but also generalizes to a wider range of quantization types, including affine and non-uniform quantization, enhancing compatibility with more frameworks. Extensive experiments with recent LLMs demonstrate that LeanQuant is highly accurate, comparing favorably against competitive baselines in model quality, and scalable, achieving very accurate quantization of Llama-3.1 405B, one of the largest open-source LLMs to date, using two Quadro RTX 8000-48GB GPUs in 21 hours. Our code is available at https://github.com/LeanModels/LeanQuant."
Poster,Lean-STaR: Learning to Interleave Thinking and Proving,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29611,"Haohan Lin, Zhiqing Sun, Sean Welleck, Yiming Yang","Traditional language model-based theorem proving assumes that by training on a sufficient amount of formal proof data, a model will learn to prove theorems. Our key observation is that a wealth of informal information that is not present in formal proofs can be useful for learning to prove theorems. For instance, humans think through steps of a proof, but this thought process is not visible in the resulting code. We present Lean-STaR, a framework for training language models to produce informal thoughts prior to each step of a proof, thereby boosting the model's theorem-proving capabilities. Lean-STaR uses retrospective ground-truth tactics to generate synthetic thoughts for training the language model. At inference time, the trained model directly generates the thoughts prior to the prediction of the tactics in each proof step. Building on the self-taught reasoner framework, we then apply expert iteration to further fine-tune the model on the correct proofs it samples and verifies using the Lean solver. Lean-STaR significantly outperform base models (43.4% → 46.3%, Pass@64). We also analyze the impact of the augmented thoughts on various aspects of the theorem proving process, providing insights into their effectiveness."
Poster,LeanVec: Searching vectors faster by making them fit,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31495,"Ishwar Bhati, Cecilia Aguerrebere, Mark Hildebrand, Theodore Willke, Mariano Tepper","Modern deep learning models have the ability to generate high-dimensional vectors whose similarity reflects semantic resemblance.
Thus, similarity search, i.e., the operation of retrieving those vectors in a large collection that are similar to a given query, has become a critical component of a wide range of applications that demand highly accurate and timely answers. In this setting, the high vector dimensionality puts similarity search systems under compute and memory pressure, leading to subpar performance.
Additionally, cross-modal retrieval tasks have become increasingly common, e.g., where a user inputs a text query to find the most relevant images for that query. However, these queries often have different distributions than the database embeddings, making it challenging to achieve high accuracy. In this work, we present LeanVec, a framework that combines linear dimensionality reduction with vector quantization to accelerate similarity search on high-dimensional vectors while maintaining accuracy. We present LeanVec variants for in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) queries. LeanVec-ID yields accuracies on par with those from recently introduced deep learning alternatives whose computational overhead precludes their usage in practice. LeanVec-OOD uses a novel technique for dimensionality reduction that considers the query and database distributions to simultaneously boost the accuracy and the performance of the framework even further (even presenting competitive results when the query and database distributions match). All in all, our extensive and varied experimental results show that LeanVec produces state-of-the-art results, with up to 3.7x improvement in search throughput and up to 4.9x faster index build time over the state of the art."
Poster,Learnable Expansion of Graph Operators for Multi-Modal Feature Fusion,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29612,"Dexuan Ding, Lei Wang, Liyun Zhu, Tom Gedeon, Piotr Koniusz","In computer vision tasks, features often come from diverse representations, domains (e.g., indoor and outdoor), and modalities (e.g., text, images, and videos). Effectively fusing these features is essential for robust performance, especially with the availability of powerful pre-trained models like vision-language models. However, common fusion methods, such as concatenation, element-wise operations, and non-linear techniques, often fail to capture structural relationships, deep feature interactions, and suffer from inefficiency or misalignment of features across domains or modalities. In this paper, we shift from high-dimensional feature space to a lower-dimensional, interpretable graph space by constructing relationship graphs that encode feature relationships at different levels, e.g., clip, frame, patch, token, etc. To capture deeper interactions, we expand graphs through iterative graph relationship updates and introduce a learnable graph fusion operator to integrate these expanded relationships for more effective fusion. Our approach is relationship-centric, operates in a homogeneous space, and is mathematically principled, resembling element-wise relationship score aggregation via multilinear polynomials. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph-based fusion method on video anomaly detection, showing strong performance across multi-representational, multi-modal, and multi-domain feature fusion tasks."
Poster,Learn-by-interact: A Data-Centric Framework For Self-Adaptive Agents in Realistic Environments,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31073,"Hongjin SU, Ruoxi Sun, Jinsung Yoon, Pengcheng Yin, Tao Yu, Sercan Arik","Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance human capabilities, assisting with digital tasks from sending emails to performing data analysis.   The abilities of existing LLMs at such tasks are often hindered by the lack of high-quality agent data from the corresponding environments they interact with.  We propose LEARN-BY-INTERACT, a data-centric framework to adapt LLM agents to any given environments without human annotations.   LEARN-BY-INTERACT synthesizes trajectories of agent-environment interactions based on documentations, and constructs instructions by summarizing or abstracting the interaction histories, a process called backward construction. We assess the quality of our synthetic data by using them in both training-based scenarios and training-free in-context learning (ICL), where we craft innovative retrieval approaches optimized for agents. Extensive experiments on SWE-bench, WebArena, OSWorld, and Spider2-V spanning across realistic coding, web, and desktop environments show the effectiveness of LEARN-BY-INTERACT in various downstream agentic tasks — baseline results are improved up to 11.1% for ICL with Claude-3.5 and 23.1% for training with Codestral-22B. We further demonstrate the critical role of backward construction, which provides up to 10.6% improvement for training.  Our ablation studies demonstrate the efficiency provided by our synthesized data in ICL and the superiority of our retrieval pipeline over alternative approaches like conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We expect that LEARN-BY-INTERACT will serve as a foundation for agent data synthesis as LLMs are increasingly deployed at real-world environments."
Poster,Learned Reference-based Diffusion Sampler for multi-modal distributions,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28860,"Maxence Noble, Louis Grenioux, Marylou Gabrié, Alain Oliviero Durmus","Over the past few years, several approaches utilizing score-based diffusion have been proposed to sample from probability distributions, that is without having access to exact samples and relying solely on evaluations of unnormalized densities. The resulting samplers approximate the time-reversal of a noising diffusion process, bridging the target distribution to an easy-to-sample base distribution. In practice, the performance of these methods heavily depends on key hyperparameters that require ground truth samples to be accurately tuned. Our work aims to highlight and address this fundamental issue, focusing in particular on multi-modal distributions, which pose significant challenges for existing sampling methods. Building on existing approaches, we introduce *Learned Reference-based Diffusion Sampler* (LRDS), a methodology specifically designed to leverage prior knowledge on the location of the target modes in order to bypass the obstacle of hyperparameter tuning. LRDS proceeds in two steps by (i) learning a *reference* diffusion model on samples located in high-density space regions and tailored for multimodality, and (ii) using this reference model to foster the training of a diffusion-based sampler. We experimentally demonstrate that LRDS best exploits prior knowledge on the target distribution compared to competing algorithms on a variety of challenging distributions."
Poster,Learn hybrid prototypes for multivariate time series anomaly detection,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30767,Ke-Yuan Shen,"In multivariate time series anomaly detection (MTSAD), reconstruction-based models reconstruct testing series with learned knowledge of only normal series and identify anomalies with higher reconstruction errors. In practice, over-generalization often occurs with unexpectedly well reconstruction of anomalies. Although memory banks are employed by reconstruction-based models to fight against over-generalization, these models are only efficient to detect point anomalies since they learn normal prototypes from time points, leaving interval anomalies and periodical anomalies to be discovered. To settle this problem, this paper propose a hybrid prototypes learning model for MTSAD based on reconstruction, named as H-PAD. First, normal prototypes are learned from different sizes of the patches for time series to discover interval anomalies. These prototypes in different sizes are integrated together to reconstruct query series so that any anomalies would be smoothed off and high reconstruction errors are produced. Furthermore, period prototypes are learned to discover periodical anomalies. One period prototype is memorized for one variable of the query series. Finally, extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of H-PAD."
