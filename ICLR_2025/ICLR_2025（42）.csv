Poster,BoneMet: An Open Large-Scale Multi-Modal Murine Dataset for Breast Cancer Bone Metastasis Diagnosis and Prognosis,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29268,"Tiankuo Chu, Fudong Lin, Shubo Wang, Jason Jiang, Wiley Gong, Xu Yuan, Liyun Wang","Breast cancer bone metastasis (BCBM) affects women’s health globally, calling for the development of effective diagnosis and prognosis solutions. While deep learning has exhibited impressive capacities across various healthcare domains, its applicability in BCBM diseases is consistently hindered by the lack of an open, large-scale, deep learning-ready dataset. As such, we introduce the Bone Metastasis (BoneMet) dataset, the first large-scale, publicly available, high-resolution medical resource, which is derived from a well-accepted murine BCBM model. The unique advantage of BoneMet over existing human datasets is repeated sequential scans per subject over the entire disease development phases. The dataset consists of over 67 terabytes of multi-modal medical data, including 2D X-ray images, 3D CT scans, and detailed biological data (e.g., medical records and bone quantitative analysis), collected from more than five hundreds mice spanning from 2019 to 2024. Our BoneMet dataset is well-organized into six components, i.e., RotationX-Ray, Recon-CT, Seg-CT, Regist-CT, RoI-CT, and MiceMediRec. We further show that BoneMet can be readily adopted to build versatile, large-scale AI models for managing BCBM diseases in terms of diagnosis using 2D or 3D images, prognosis of bone deterioration, and sparse-angle 3D reconstruction for safe long-term disease monitoring. Our preliminary results demonstrate that BoneMet has the potentials to jump-start the development and fine-tuning of AI-driven solutions prior to their applications to human patients. To facilitate its easy access and wide dissemination, we have created the BoneMet package, providing three APIs that enable researchers to (i) flexibly process and download the BoneMet data filtered by specific time frames; and (ii) develop and train large-scale AI models for precise BCBM diagnosis and prognosis. The BoneMet dataset is officially available on Hugging Face Datasets at https://huggingface.co/datasets/BoneMet/BoneMet. The BoneMet package is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) at https://pypi.org/project/BoneMet. Code and tutorials are available at https://github.com/Tiankuo528/BoneMet."
Poster,Bonsai: Gradient-free Graph Condensation for Node Classification,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30924,"Mridul Gupta, Samyak Jain, Vansh Ramani, HARIPRASAD KODAMANA, Sayan Ranu","Graph condensation has emerged as a promising avenue to enable scalable training of GNNs by compressing the training dataset while preserving essential graph characteristics. Our study uncovers significant shortcomings in current graph condensation techniques. First, the majority of the algorithms paradoxically require training on the full dataset to perform condensation. Second, due to their gradient-emulating approach, these methods require fresh condensation for any change in hyperparameters or GNN architecture, limiting their flexibility and reusability. To address these challenges, we present Bonsai, a novel graph condensation method empowered by the observation that *computation trees* form the fundamental processing units of message-passing GNNs. Bonsai condenses datasets by encoding a careful selection of *exemplar* trees that maximize the representation of all computation trees in the training set. This unique approach imparts Bonsai as the first linear-time, model-agnostic graph condensation algorithm for node classification that outperforms existing baselines across $7$ real-world datasets on accuracy, while being $22$ times faster on average. Bonsai is grounded in rigorous mathematical guarantees on the adopted approximation strategies, making it robust to GNN architectures, datasets, and parameters."
Poster,Booster: Tackling Harmful Fine-tuning for Large Language Models via Attenuating Harmful Perturbation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28050,"Tiansheng Huang, Sihao Hu, Fatih Ilhan, Selim Tekin, Ling Liu","Harmful fine-tuning attack poses serious safety concerns for large language models' fine-tuning-as-a-service. While existing defenses have been proposed to mitigate the issue, their performances are still far away from satisfactory, and the root cause of the problem has not been fully recovered. To this end, we in this paper show that \textit{harmful perturbation} over the model weights could be a probable cause of alignment-broken. In order to attenuate the negative impact of harmful perturbation, we propose an alignment-stage solution, dubbed Booster. Technically, along with the original alignment loss,  we append a loss regularizer in the alignment stage's optimization. The regularizer ensures that the model's harmful loss reduction after the simulated harmful perturbation is attenuated, thereby mitigating the subsequent fine-tuning risk.     Empirical results show that Booster can effectively reduce the harmful score of the fine-tuned models while maintaining the performance of downstream tasks.

Poster,Boosting Latent Diffusion with Perceptual Objectives,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27753,"Tariq Berrada, Pietro Astolfi, Melissa Hall, Marton Havasi, Yohann Benchetrit, Adriana Romero-Soriano, Karteek Alahari, Michal Drozdzal, Jakob Verbeek","Latent diffusion models (LDMs) power state-of-the-art high-resolution generative image models. LDMs learn the data distribution in the latent space of an autoencoder (AE) and produce images by mapping the generated latents into RGB image space using the AE decoder. While this approach allows for efficient model training and sampling, it induces a disconnect between the training of the diffusion model and the decoder, resulting in a loss of detail in the generated images. To remediate this disconnect, we propose to leverage the internal features of the decoder to define a latent perceptual loss (LPL). This loss encourages the models to create sharper and more realistic images. Our loss can be seamlessly integrated with common autoencoders used in latent diffusion models, and can be applied to different generative modeling paradigms such as DDPM with epsilon and velocity prediction, as well as flow matching. Extensive experiments with models trained on three datasets at 256 and 512 resolution show improved quantitative -- with boosts between 6% and 20% in  FID -- and qualitative results when using our perceptual loss."
Poster,Boosting Methods for Interval-censored Data with Regression and Classification,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30432,"Yuan Bian, Grace Yi, Wenqing He","Boosting has garnered significant interest across both machine learning and statistical communities. Traditional boosting algorithms, designed for fully observed random samples, often struggle with real-world problems, particularly with interval-censored data. This type of data is common in survival analysis and time-to-event studies where exact event times are unobserved but fall within known intervals. Effective handling of such data is crucial in fields like medical research, reliability engineering, and social sciences. In this work, we introduce novel nonparametric boosting methods for regression and classification tasks with interval-censored data. Our approaches leverage censoring unbiased transformations to adjust loss functions and impute transformed responses while maintaining model accuracy. Implemented via functional gradient descent, these methods ensure scalability and adaptability. We rigorously establish their theoretical properties, including optimality and mean squared error trade-offs. Our proposed methods not only offer a robust framework for enhancing predictive accuracy in domains where interval-censored data are common but also complement existing work, expanding the applicability of existing boosting techniques. Empirical studies demonstrate robust performance across various finite-sample scenarios, highlighting the practical utility of our approaches."
Poster,Boosting Multiple Views for pretrained-based Continual Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30627,"Quyen Tran, Tung Lam Tran, Khanh Doan, Toan Tran, Dinh Phung, Khoat Than, Trung Le","Recent research has shown that Random Projection (RP) can effectively improve the performance of pre-trained models in Continual learning (CL). The authors hypothesized that using RP to map features onto a higher-dimensional space can make them more linearly separable. In this work, we theoretically analyze the role of RP and present its benefits for improving the model’s generalization abilityin each task and facilitating CL overall. Additionally, we take this result to the next level by proposing a Multi-View Random Projection scheme for a stronger ensemble classifier. In particular, we train a set of linear experts, among which diversity is encouraged based on the principle of AdaBoost, which was initially very challenging to apply to CL. Moreover, we employ a task-based adaptive backbonewith distinct prompts dedicated to each task for better representation learning. To properly select these task-specific components and mitigate potential feature shifts caused by misprediction, we introduce a simple yet effective technique called the self-improvement process. Experimentally, our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range of datasets."
Poster,Boosting Neural Combinatorial Optimization for Large-Scale Vehicle Routing Problems,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29530,"Fu Luo, Xi Lin, Yaoxin Wu, Zhenkun Wang, Tong Xialiang, Mingxuan Yuan, Qingfu Zhang","Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) methods have exhibited promising performance in solving Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). However, most NCO methods rely on the conventional self-attention mechanism that induces excessive computational complexity, thereby struggling to contend with large-scale VRPs and hindering their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose a lightweight cross-attention mechanism with linear complexity, by which a Transformer network is developed to learn efficient and favorable solutions for large-scale VRPs. We also propose a Self-Improved Training (SIT) algorithm that enables direct model training on large-scale VRP instances, bypassing extensive computational overhead for attaining labels. By iterating solution reconstruction, the Transformer network itself can generate improved partial solutions as pseudo-labels to guide the model training. Experimental results on the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) with up to 100K nodes indicate that our method consistently achieves superior performance for synthetic and real-world benchmarks, significantly boosting the scalability of NCO methods."
Poster,Boosting Perturbed Gradient Ascent for Last-Iterate Convergence in Games,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30088,"Kenshi Abe, Mitsuki Sakamoto, Kaito Ariu, Atsushi Iwasaki","This paper presents a payoff perturbation technique, introducing a strong convexity to players' payoff functions in games. This technique is specifically designed for first-order methods to achieve last-iterate convergence in games where the gradient of the payoff functions is monotone in the strategy profile space, potentially containing additive noise. Although perturbation is known to facilitate the convergence of learning algorithms, the magnitude of perturbation requires careful adjustment to ensure last-iterate convergence. Previous studies have proposed a scheme in which the magnitude is determined by the distance from a periodically re-initialized anchoring or reference strategy. Building upon this, we propose Gradient Ascent with Boosting Payoff Perturbation, which incorporates a novel perturbation into the underlying payoff function, maintaining the periodically re-initializing anchoring strategy scheme. This innovation empowers us to provide faster last-iterate convergence rates against the existing payoff perturbed algorithms, even in the presence of additive noise."
Poster,Boosting Ray Search Procedure of Hard-label Attacks with Transfer-based Priors,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28063,"Chen Ma, Xinjie Xu, Shuyu Cheng, Qi Xuan","One of the most practical and challenging types of black-box adversarial attacks is the hard-label attack, where only top-1 predicted labels are available. One effective approach is to search for the optimal ray direction from the benign image that minimizes the $\ell_p$ norm distance to the adversarial region. The unique advantage of this approach is that it transforms the hard-label attack into a continuous optimization problem. The objective function value is the ray's radius and can be obtained through a binary search with high query cost. Existing methods use a ""sign trick"" in gradient estimation to reduce queries. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the quality of this gradient estimation, proposing a novel prior-guided approach to improve ray search efficiency, based on theoretical and experimental analysis. Specifically, we utilize the transfer-based priors from surrogate models, and our gradient estimators appropriately integrate them by approximating the projection of the true gradient onto the subspace spanned by these priors and some random directions, in a query-efficient way. We theoretically derive the expected cosine similarity between the obtained gradient estimators and the true gradient, and demonstrate the improvement brought by using priors. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods in terms of query efficiency."
Poster,Boosting the visual interpretability of CLIP via adversarial fine-tuning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28566,"Shizhan Gong, Haoyu LEI, Qi Dou, Farzan Farnia","CLIP has achieved great success in visual representation learning and is becoming an important plug-in component for many large multi-modal models like LLaVA and DALL-E. However, the lack of interpretability caused by the intricate image encoder architecture and training process restricts its wider use in high-stake decision making applications. In this work, we propose an unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning (AFT) with norm-regularization to enhance the visual interpretability of CLIP. We provide theoretical analysis showing that AFT has implicit regularization that enforces the image encoder to encode the input features sparsely, directing the network's focus towards meaningful features. Evaluations by both feature attribution techniques and network dissection offer convincing evidence that the visual interpretability of CLIP has significant improvements. With AFT, the image encoder prioritizes pertinent input features, and the neuron within the encoder exhibits better alignment with human-understandable concepts. Moreover, these effects are generalizable to out-of-distribution datasets and can be transferred to downstream tasks. Additionally, AFT enhances the visual interpretability of derived large vision-language models that incorporate the pre-trained CLIP an integral component. The code of this paper is available at [the CLIP_AFT GitHub repository](https://github.com/peterant330/CLIP_AFT)."
