Poster,Spectral Compressive Imaging via Unmixing-driven Subspace Diffusion Refinement,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29715,"Haijin Zeng, Benteng Sun, Yongyong Chen, Jingyong Su, Yong Xu","Spectral Compressive Imaging (SCI) reconstruction is inherently ill-posed, offering multiple plausible solutions from a single observation. Traditional deterministic methods typically struggle to effectively recover high-frequency details. Although diffusion models offer promising solutions to this challenge, their application is constrained by the limited training data and high computational demands associated with multispectral images (MSIs), complicating direct training. To address these issues, we propose a novel Predict-and-unmixing-driven-Subspace-Refine framework (PSR-SCI). This framework begins with a cost-effective predictor that produces an initial, rough estimate of the MSI. Subsequently, we introduce a unmixing-driven reversible spectral embedding module that decomposes the MSI into subspace images and spectral coefficients. This decomposition facilitates the adaptation of pre-trained RGB diffusion models and focuses refinement processes on high-frequency details, thereby enabling efficient diffusion generation with minimal MSI data. Additionally, we design a high-dimensional guidance mechanism with imaging consistency to enhance the model's efficacy. The refined subspace image is then reconstructed back into an MSI using the reversible embedding, yielding the final MSI with full spectral resolution. Experimental results on the standard KAIST and zero-shot datasets NTIRE, ICVL, and Harvard show that PSR-SCI enhances visual quality and delivers PSNR and SSIM metrics comparable to existing diffusion, transformer, and deep unfolding techniques. This framework provides a robust alternative to traditional deterministic SCI reconstruction methods.

Poster,Spectral-Refiner: Accurate Fine-Tuning of Spatiotemporal Fourier Neural Operator for Turbulent Flows,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29939,"Shuhao Cao, Francesco Brarda, Ruipeng Li, Yuanzhe Xi","Recent advancements in operator-type neural networks have shown promising results in approximating the solutions of spatiotemporal Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, these neural networks often entail considerable training expenses, and may not always achieve the desired accuracy required in many scientific and engineering disciplines. Recent advancements in operator-type neural networks have shown promising results in approximating the solutions of spatiotemporal Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, these neural networks often entail considerable training expenses, and may not always achieve the desired accuracy required in many scientific and engineering disciplines.  In this paper, we propose a new learning framework to address these issues. A new spatiotemporal adaptation is proposed to generalize any Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) variant to learn maps between Bochner spaces, which can perform an arbitrary-length temporal super-resolution for the first time.  To better exploit this capacity, a new paradigm is proposed to refine the commonly adopted end-to-end neural operator training and evaluations with the help from the wisdom from traditional numerical PDE theory and techniques.  Specifically, in the learning problems for the turbulent flow modeled by the Navier-Stokes Equations (NSE), the proposed paradigm trains an FNO only for a few epochs. Then, only the newly proposed spatiotemporal spectral convolution layer is fine-tuned without the frequency truncation. The spectral fine-tuning loss function uses a negative Sobolev norm for the first time in operator learning, defined through a reliable functional-type a posteriori error estimator whose evaluation is exact thanks to the Parseval identity. Moreover, unlike the difficult nonconvex optimization problems in the end-to-end training, this fine-tuning loss is convex.  Numerical experiments on commonly used NSE benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in both computational efficiency and accuracy, compared to end-to-end evaluation and traditional numerical PDE solvers under certain conditions.

Poster,Spectro-Riemannian Graph Neural Networks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31145,"Karish Grover, Haiyang Yu, Xiang song, Qi Zhu, Han Xie, Vassilis Ioannidis, Christos Faloutsos","Can integrating spectral and curvature signals unlock new potential in graph representation learning? Non-Euclidean geometries, particularly Riemannian manifolds such as hyperbolic (negative curvature) and spherical (positive curvature), offer powerful inductive biases for embedding complex graph structures like scale-free, hierarchical, and cyclic patterns. Meanwhile, spectral filtering excels at processing signal variations across graphs, making it effective in homophilic and heterophilic settings. Leveraging both can significantly enhance the learned representations. To this end, we propose Spectro-Riemannian Graph Neural Networks (CUSP) - the first graph representation learning paradigm that unifies both CUrvature (geometric) and SPectral insights. CUSP is a mixed-curvature spectral GNN that learns spectral filters to optimize node embeddings in products of constant curvature manifolds (hyperbolic, spherical, and Euclidean). Specifically, CUSP introduces three novel components: (a) Cusp Laplacian, an extension of the traditional graph Laplacian based on Ollivier-Ricci curvature, designed to capture the curvature signals better; (b) Cusp Filtering, which employs multiple Riemannian graph filters to obtain cues from various bands in the eigenspectrum; and (c) Cusp Pooling, a hierarchical attention mechanism combined with a curvature-based positional encoding to assess the relative importance of differently curved substructures in our graph. Empirical evaluation across eight homophilic and heterophilic datasets demonstrates the superiority of CUSP in node classification and link prediction tasks, with a gain of up to 5.3\% over state-of-the-art models."
Poster,Speculative Knowledge Distillation: Bridging the Teacher-Student Gap Through Interleaved Sampling,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30392,"Wenda Xu, Rujun Han, Zifeng Wang, Long Le, Dhruv Madeka, Lei Li, William Wang, Rishabh Agarwal, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister","Recent advances in knowledge distillation (KD) have enabled smaller student models to approach the performance of larger teacher models. However, popular methods such as supervised KD and on-policy KD, are adversely impacted by the knowledge gaps between teacher-student in practical scenarios. Supervised KD suffers from a distribution mismatch between training with a static dataset and inference over final student-generated outputs. Conversely, on-policy KD, which uses student-generated samples for training, can suffer from low-quality training examples with which teacher models are not familiar, resulting in inaccurate teacher feedback. To address these limitations, we introduce Speculative Knowledge Distillation (SKD), a novel approach that leverages cooperation between student and teacher models to generate high-quality training data on-the-fly while aligning with the student's inference-time distribution. In SKD, the student proposes tokens, and the teacher replaces poorly ranked ones based on its own distribution, transferring high-quality knowledge adaptively. We evaluate SKD on various text generation tasks, including translation, summarization, math, and instruction following, and show that SKD consistently outperforms existing KD methods across different domains, data sizes, and model initialization strategies."
Poster,Speculative RAG: Enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation through Drafting,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27773,"Zilong (Ryan) Wang, Zifeng Wang, Long Le, Huaixiu Steven Zheng, Swaroop Mishra, Vincent Perot, Yuwei Zhang, Anush Mattapalli, Ankur Taly, Jingbo Shang, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister","Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) combines the generative abilities of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge sources to provide more accurate and up-to-date responses. Recent RAG advancements focus on improving retrieval outcomes through iterative LLM refinement or self-critique capabilities acquired through additional instruction tuning of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Speculative RAG - a framework that leverages a larger generalist LM to efficiently verify multiple RAG drafts produced in parallel by a smaller, distilled specialist LM. Each draft is generated from a distinct subset of retrieved documents, offering diverse perspectives on the evidence while reducing input token counts per draft. This approach enhances comprehension of each subset and mitigates potential position bias over long context. Our method accelerates RAG by delegating drafting to the smaller specialist LM, with the larger generalist LM performing a single verification pass over the drafts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Speculative RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced latency on TriviaQA, MuSiQue, PopQA, PubHealth, and ARC-Challenge benchmarks. It notably enhances accuracy by up to 12.97% while reducing latency by 50.83% compared to conventional RAG systems on PubHealth."
Poster,Speech Robust Bench: A Robustness Benchmark For Speech Recognition,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30483,"Muhammad Shah, David Solans Noguero, Mikko Heikkilä, Bhiksha Raj, Nicolas Kourtellis","As Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models become ever more pervasive, it is important to ensure that they make reliable predictions under corruptions present in the physical and digital world. We propose  Speech Robust Bench (SRB), a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the robustness of ASR models to diverse corruptions. SRB is composed of 114 input perturbations which simulate an heterogeneous range of corruptions that ASR models may encounter when deployed in the wild. We use SRB to evaluate the robustness of several state-of-the-art ASR models and observe that model size and certain modeling choices such as the use of discrete representations, or self-training appear to be conducive to robustness. We extend this analysis to measure the robustness of ASR models on data from various demographic subgroups, namely English and Spanish speakers, and males and females. Our results revealed noticeable disparities in the model's robustness across subgroups. We believe that SRB will significantly facilitate future research towards robust ASR models, by making it easier to conduct comprehensive and comparable robustness evaluations."
Poster,Spherical Tree-Sliced Wasserstein Distance,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30344,"Viet-Hoang Tran, Thanh Chu, Minh-Khoi Nguyen-Nhat, Trang Pham, Tam Le, Tan Nguyen","Sliced Optimal Transport (OT) simplifies the OT problem in high-dimensional spaces by projecting supports of input measures onto one-dimensional lines, then exploiting the closed-form expression of the univariate OT to reduce the computational burden of OT. Recently, the Tree-Sliced method has been introduced to replace these lines with more intricate structures, known as tree systems. This approach enhances the ability to capture topological information of integration domains in Sliced OT while maintaining low computational cost. Inspired by this approach, in this paper, we present an adaptation of tree systems on OT problem for measures supported on a sphere. As counterpart to the Radon transform variant on tree systems, we propose a novel spherical Radon transform, with a new integration domain called spherical trees. By leveraging this transform and exploiting the spherical tree structures, we derive closed-form expressions for OT problems on the sphere. Consequently, we obtain an efficient metric for measures on the sphere, named Spherical Tree-Sliced Wasserstein (STSW) distance. We provide an extensive theoretical analysis to demonstrate the topology of spherical trees, the well-definedness and injectivity of our Radon transform variant, which leads to an orthogonally invariant distance between spherical measures. Finally, we conduct a wide range of numerical experiments, including gradient flows and self-supervised learning, to assess the performance of our proposed metric, comparing it to recent benchmarks."

The databases in Spider 2.0 are sourced from real data applications, often containing over 1,000 columns and stored in local or cloud database systems such as BigQuery and Snowflake.We show that solving problems in Spider 2.0 frequently requires understanding and searching through database metadata, dialect documentation, and even project-level codebases. This challenge calls for models to interact with complex SQL workflow environments, process extremely long contexts, perform intricate reasoning, and generate multiple SQL queries with diverse operations, often exceeding $100$ lines, which goes far beyond traditional text-to-SQL challenges.Our evaluations indicate that based on o1-preview, our code agent framework successfully solves only 21.3\% of the tasks, compared with 91.2\% on Spider 1.0 and 73.0\% on BIRD.Our results on Spider 2.0 show that while language models have demonstrated remarkable performance in code generation --- especially in prior text-to-SQL benchmarks --- they require significant improvement in order to achieve adequate performance for real-world enterprise usage.Progress on Spider 2.0 represents crucial steps towards developing intelligent, autonomous, code agents for real-world enterprise settings.Our code, baseline models, and data are available at [spider2-sql.github.io](spider2-sql.github.io) ."
Poster,SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31473,"Rui-Jie Zhu, Qihang Zhao, Jason Eshraghian, Guoqi Li","As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run them. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and until now, SNNs have yet to succeed at language generation on large-scale datasets. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 46M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model when released, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self-attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(T^2)$ to linear complexity $\mathcal{O}(T)$ with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 32.2$\times$ fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/SpikeGPT."
Poster,SpikeLLM: Scaling up Spiking Neural Network to Large Language Models via Saliency-based Spiking,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29210,"Xingrun Xing, Boyan Gao, Zheng Liu, David Clifton, Shitao Xiao, Wanpeng Zhang, Li Du, Zheng Zhang, Guoqi Li, Jiajun Zhang","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters have improved performance in various applications, but their inference processes demand significant energy and computational resources. In contrast, the human brain, with approximately 86 billion neurons, is much more energy-efficient than LLMs with similar parameters. Inspired by this, we redesign 7$\sim$70 billion parameter LLMs using bio-plausible spiking mechanisms, emulating the efficient behavior of the human brain. We propose the first spiking large language model, SpikeLLM. Coupled with the proposed model, two essential approaches are proposed to improve spike training efficiency: Generalized Integrate-and-Fire (GIF) neurons to compress spike length from $T$ to $\frac{T}{L} \log_2 L$ bits, and an Optimal Brain Spiking framework to divide outlier channels and allocate different $T$ for GIF neurons, which further compresses spike length to approximate $log_2T$ bits. The necessity of spike-driven LLM is proved by comparison with quantized LLMs with similar operations. In the OmniQuant pipeline, SpikeLLM reduces 11.01\% WikiText2 perplexity and improves 2.55\% accuracy of common scene reasoning on a LLAMA-7B W4A4 model. In the GPTQ pipeline, SpikeLLM achieves direct additive in linear layers, significantly exceeding PB-LLMs. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Xingrun-Xing2/SpikeLLM."
