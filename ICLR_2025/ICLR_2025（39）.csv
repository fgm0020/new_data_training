Poster,Bi-Factorial Preference Optimization: Balancing Safety-Helpfulness in Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30263,"Wenxuan Zhang, Philip Torr, Mohamed Elhoseiny, Adel Bibi","Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs)  on human preferences, typically through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), has proven successful in enhancing their capabilities.  However, ensuring the safety of LLMs during fine-tuning remains a critical concern, and mitigating the potential conflicts in  safety and helpfulness  is costly in RLHF.  To address this issue, we propose a supervised learning framework called Bi-Factorial Preference Optimization (BFPO), which re-parameterizes a joint RLHF objective of both safety and helpfulness into a single supervised learning objective. In the supervised optimization, a labeling function is used to capture global preferences ranking to balance both safety and helpfulness. To  evaluate BFPO, we  develop a benchmark  including comprehensive discriminative and generative tasks for helpfulness and harmlessness. The results indicate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both safety and helpfulness. Moreover, BFPO eliminates the need for human prompting and annotation in LLM fine-tuning while achieving the same level of safety as methods that heavily rely on human labor, with less than 10\% of the computational resources. The training recipes and models will be released."
Poster,BigCodeBench: Benchmarking Code Generation with Diverse Function Calls and Complex Instructions,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29245,"Terry Yue Zhuo, Minh Chien Vu, Jenny Chim, Han Hu, Wenhao Yu, Ratnadira Widyasari, Imam Nur Bani Yusuf, Haolan Zhan, Junda He, Indraneil Paul, Simon Brunner, Chen GONG, James Hoang, Armel Zebaze, Xiaoheng Hong, Wen-Ding Li, Jean Kaddour, Ming Xu, Zhihan Zhang, Prateek Yadav, Naman Jain, Alex Gu, Zhoujun Cheng, Jiawei Liu, Qian Liu, Zijian Wang, Binyuan Hui, Niklas Muennighoff, David Lo, Daniel Fried, Xiaoning Du, Harm de Vries, Leandro Von Werra","Task automation has been greatly empowered by the recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) via Python code, where the tasks range from software engineering development to general-purpose reasoning. While current benchmarks have shown that LLMs can solve tasks using programs like human developers, the majority of their evaluations are limited to short and self-contained algorithmic tasks or standalone function calls. Solving challenging and practical tasks requires the capability of utilizing **diverse function calls as tools** to efficiently implement functionalities like data analysis and web development. In addition, using multiple tools to solve a task needs compositional reasoning by accurately understanding **complex instructions**. Fulfilling both of these characteristics can pose a great challenge for LLMs. To assess how well LLMs can solve challenging and practical tasks via programs, we introduce BigCodeBench, a benchmark that challenges LLMs to invoke multiple function calls as tools from 139 libraries and 7 domains for 1,140 fine-grained tasks. To evaluate LLMs rigorously, each task encompasses 5.6 test cases with an average branch coverage of 99%. In addition, we propose a natural-language-oriented variant of BigCodeBench, BigCodeBench-Instruct, that automatically transforms the original docstrings into short instructions containing only essential information. Our extensive evaluation of 60 LLMs shows that **LLMs are not yet capable of following complex instructions to use function calls precisely, with scores up to 60%, significantly lower than the human performance of 97%**. The results underscore the need for further advancements in this area."

Tamer Özsu, Siva Reddy, Marco Pedersoli, Yoshua Bengio, Christopher Pal, Issam Laradji, Spandana Gella, Perouz Taslakian, David Vazquez, Sai Rajeswar","Multimodal AI has the potential to significantly enhance document-understanding tasks, such as processing receipts, understanding workflows, extracting data from documents, and summarizing reports. Code generation tasks that require long-structured outputs can also be enhanced by multimodality. Despite this, their use in commercial applications is often limited due to limited access to relevant training data and restrictive licensing, which hinders open access. To address these limitations, we introduce BigDocs-7.5M, a high-quality, open-access dataset comprising 7.5 million multimodal documents across 30 tasks. We use an efficient data curation process to ensure that our data is high quality and license-permissive. Our process emphasizes accountability, responsibility, and transparency through filtering rules, traceable metadata, and careful content analysis. Additionally, we introduce BigDocs-Bench,, a benchmark suite with 10 novel tasks where we carefully create datasets that reflect real-world use cases involving reasoning over Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and code generation from images. Our experiments show that training with BigDocs-Bench, improves average performance up to 25.8% over closed-source GPT-4o in document reasoning and structured output tasks such as Screenshot2HTML or Image2Latex generation. Finally, human evaluations revealed that participants preferred the outputs from models trained with BigDocs over those from GPT-4o. This suggests that BigDocs can help both academics and the open-source community utilize and improve AI tools to enhance multimodal capabilities and document reasoning."
Poster,BiGR: Harnessing Binary Latent Codes for Image Generation and Improved Visual Representation Capabilities,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31194,"Shaozhe Hao, Xuantong LIU, Xianbiao Qi, Shihao Zhao, Bojia Zi, Rong Xiao, Kai Han, Kwan-Yee K Wong","We introduce BiGR, a novel conditional image generation model using compact binary latent codes for generative training, focusing on enhancing both generation and representation capabilities. BiGR is the first conditional generative model that unifies generation and discrimination within the same framework. BiGR features a binary tokenizer, a masked modeling mechanism, and a binary transcoder for binary code prediction. Additionally, we introduce a novel entropy-ordered sampling method to enable efficient image generation. Extensive experiments validate BiGR's superior performance in generation quality, as measured by FID-50k, and representation capabilities, as evidenced by linear-probe accuracy. Moreover, BiGR showcases zero-shot generalization across various vision tasks, enabling applications such as image inpainting, outpainting, editing, interpolation, and enrichment, without the need for structural modifications. Our findings suggest that BiGR unifies generative and discriminative tasks effectively, paving the way for further advancements in the field. We further enable BiGR to perform text-to-image generation, showcasing its potential for broader applications."
Poster,Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28827,"Michael Pearce, Thomas Dooms, Alice Rigg, Jose Oramas, Lee Sharkey","A mechanistic understanding of how MLPs do computation in deep neural net-works remains elusive. Current interpretability work can extract features fromhidden activations over an input dataset but generally cannot explain how MLPweights construct features. One challenge is that element-wise nonlinearitiesintroduce higher-order interactions and make it difficult to trace computationsthrough the MLP layer. In this paper, we analyze bilinear MLPs, a type ofGated Linear Unit (GLU) without any element-wise nonlinearity that neverthe-less achieves competitive performance. Bilinear MLPs can be fully expressed interms of linear operations using a third-order tensor, allowing flexible analysis ofthe weights. Analyzing the spectra of bilinear MLP weights using eigendecom-position reveals interpretable low-rank structure across toy tasks, image classifi-cation, and language modeling. We use this understanding to craft adversarialexamples, uncover overfitting, and identify small language model circuits directlyfrom the weights alone. Our results demonstrate that bilinear layers serve as aninterpretable drop-in replacement for current activation functions and that weight-based interpretability is viable for understanding deep-learning models."
Poster,BinaryDM: Accurate Weight Binarization for Efficient Diffusion Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29258,"Xingyu Zheng, Xianglong Liu, Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Mingyuan Zhang, Haojie Hao, Jiakai Wang, Zixiang Zhao, Jinyang Guo, Michele Magno","With the advancement of diffusion models (DMs) and the substantially increased computational requirements, quantization emerges as a practical solution to obtain compact and efficient low-bit DMs. However, the highly discrete representation leads to severe accuracy degradation, hindering the quantization of diffusion models to ultra-low bit-widths. This paper proposes a novel weight binarization approach for DMs, namely BinaryDM, pushing binarized DMs to be accurate and efficient by improving the representation and optimization. From the representation perspective, we present an Evolvable-Basis Binarizer (EBB) to enable a smooth evolution of DMs from full-precision to accurately binarized. EBB enhances information representation in the initial stage through the flexible combination of multiple binary bases and applies regularization to evolve into efficient single-basis binarization. The evolution only occurs in the head and tail of the DM architecture to retain the stability of training. From the optimization perspective, a Low-rank Representation Mimicking (LRM) is applied to assist the optimization of binarized DMs. The LRM mimics the representations of full-precision DMs in low-rank space, alleviating the direction ambiguity of the optimization process caused by fine-grained alignment. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that BinaryDM achieves significant accuracy and efficiency gains compared to SOTA quantization methods of DMs under ultra-low bit-widths. With 1-bit weight and 4-bit activation (W1A4), BinaryDM achieves as low as 7.74 FID and saves the performance from collapse (baseline FID 10.87). As the first binarization method for diffusion models, W1A4 BinaryDM achieves impressive 15.2x OPs and 29.2x model size savings, showcasing its substantial potential for edge deployment."
Poster,Binary Losses for Density Ratio Estimation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30970,Werner Zellinger,"Estimating the ratio of two probability densities from a finite number of observations is a central machine learning problem. A common approach is to construct estimators using binary classifiers that distinguish observations from the two densities. However, the accuracy of these estimators depends on the choice of the binary loss function, raising the question of which loss function to choose based on desired error properties. For example, traditional loss functions, such as logistic or boosting loss, prioritize accurate estimation of small density ratio values over large ones, even though the latter are more critical in many applications.In this work, we start with prescribed error measures in a class of Bregman divergences and characterize all loss functions that result in density ratio estimators with small error. Our characterization extends results on composite binary losses from Reid & Williamson (2010) and their connection to density ratio estimation as identified by Menon & Ong (2016). As a result, we obtain a simple recipe for constructing loss functions with certain properties, such as those that prioritize an accurate estimation of large density ratio values. Our novel loss functions outperform related approaches for resolving parameter choice issues of 11 deep domain adaptation algorithms in average performance across 484 real-world tasks including sensor signals, texts, and images."
Poster,BingoGuard: LLM Content Moderation Tools with Risk Levels,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30227,"Fan Yin, Philippe Laban, XIANGYU PENG, Yilun Zhou, Yixin Mao, Vaibhav Vats, Linnea Ross, Divyansh Agarwal, Caiming Xiong, Chien-Sheng Wu","Malicious content generated by large language models (LLMs) can pose varying degrees of harm. Although existing LLM-based moderators can detect harmful content, they struggle to assess risk levels and may miss lower-risk outputs. Accurate risk assessment allows platforms with different safety thresholds to tailor content filtering and rejection. In this paper, we introduce per-topic severity rubrics for 11 harmful topics and build BingoGuard, an LLM-based moderation system designed to predict both binary safety labels and severity levels. To address the lack of annotations on levels of severity, we propose a scalable generate-then-filter framework that first generates responses across different severity levels and then filters out low-quality responses. Using this framework, we create BingoGuardTrain, a training dataset with 54,897 examples covering a variety of topics, response severity, styles, and BingoGuardTest, a test set with 988 examples explicitly labeled based on our severity rubrics that enables fine-grained analysis on model behaviors on different severity levels. Our BingoGuard-8B, trained on BingoGuardTrain, achieves the state-of-the-art performance on several moderation benchmarks, including WildGuardTest and HarmBench, as well as BingoGuardTest, outperforming best public models, WildGuard, by 4.3\%. Our analysis demonstrates that incorporating severity levels into training significantly enhances detection performance and enables the model to effectively gauge the severity of harmful responses. Warning: this paper includes red-teaming examples that may be harmful in nature."
Poster,BioDiscoveryAgent: An AI Agent for Designing Genetic Perturbation Experiments,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30240,"Yusuf Roohani, Andrew Lee, Qian Huang, Jian Vora, Zachary Steinhart, Kexin Huang, Alexander Marson, Percy Liang, Jure Leskovec","Agents based on large language models have shown great potential in accelerating scientific discovery by leveraging their rich background knowledge and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce BioDiscoveryAgent, an agent that designs new experiments, reasons about their outcomes, and efficiently navigates the hypothesis space to reach desired solutions. We demonstrate our agent on the problem of designing genetic perturbation experiments, where the aim is to find a small subset out of many possible genes that, when perturbed, result in a specific phenotype (e.g., cell growth). Utilizing its biological knowledge, BioDiscoveryAgent can uniquely design new experiments without the need to train a machine learning model or explicitly design an acquisition function as in Bayesian optimization. Moreover, BioDiscoveryAgent using Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves an average of 21% improvement in predicting relevant genetic perturbations across six datasets, and a 46% improvement in the harder task of non-essential gene perturbation, compared to existing Bayesian optimization baselines specifically trained for this task. Our evaluation includes one dataset that is unpublished, ensuring it is not part of the language model's training data. Additionally, BioDiscoveryAgent predicts gene combinations to perturb more than twice as accurately as a random baseline, a task so far not explored in the context of closed-loop experiment design. The agent also has access to tools for searching the biomedical literature, executing code to analyze biological datasets, and prompting another agent to critically evaluate its predictions. Overall, BioDiscoveryAgent is interpretable at every stage, representing an accessible new paradigm in the computational design of biological experiments with the potential to augment scientists' efficacy."
Poster,Biologically Constrained Barrel Cortex Model Integrates Whisker Inputs and Replicates Key Brain Network Dynamics,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29441,"Tianfang Zhu, Dongli Hu, Jiandong Zhou, Kai Du, Anan LI","The brain's ability to transform sensory inputs into motor functions is central to neuroscience and crucial for the development of embodied intelligence. Sensory-motor integration involves complex neural circuits, diverse neuronal types, and intricate intercellular connections. Bridging the gap between biological realism and behavioral functionality presents a formidable challenge. In this study, we focus on the columnar structure of the superficial layers of mouse barrel cortex as a model system. We constructed a model comprising 4,218 neurons across 13 neuronal subtypes, with neural distribution and connection strengths constrained by anatomical experimental findings. A key innovation of our work is the development of an effective construction and training pipeline tailored for this biologically constrained model. Additionally, we converted an existing simulated whisker sweep dataset into a spiking-based format, enabling our network to be trained and tested on neural signals that more closely mimic those observed in biological systems. The results of object discrimination utilizing whisker signals demonstrate that our barrel cortex model, grounded in biological constraints, achieves a classification accuracy exceeds classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), by an average of 8.6%, and is on par with recent spiking neural networks (SNNs) in performance. Interestingly, a whisker deprivation experiment, designed in accordance with neuroscience practices, further validates the perceptual capabilities of our model in behavioral tasks.Critically, it offers significant biological interpretability: post-training analysis reveals that neurons within our model exhibit firing characteristics and distribution patterns similar to those observed in the actual neuronal systems of the barrel cortex. This study advances our understanding of neural processing in the barrel cortex and exemplifies how integrating detailed biological structures into neural network models can enhance both scientific inquiry and artificial intelligence applications.
