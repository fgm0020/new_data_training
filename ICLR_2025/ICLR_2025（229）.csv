Poster,Multi-Reward as Condition for Instruction-based Image Editing,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30691,"Xin Gu, Ming Li, Libo Zhang, Fan Chen, Longyin Wen, Tiejian Luo, Sijie Zhu","High-quality training triplets (instruction, original image, edited image) are essential for instruction-based image editing. Predominant training datasets (e.g., InsPix2Pix) are created using text-to-image generative models (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL-E) which are not trained for image editing. Accordingly, these datasets suffer from inaccurate instruction following, poor detail preserving, and generation artifacts. In this paper, we propose to address the training data quality issue with multi-perspective reward data instead of refining the ground-truth image quality. 1) we first design a quantitative metric system based on best-in-class LVLM (Large Vision Language Model), i.e., GPT-4o in our case, to evaluate the generation quality from 3 perspectives, namely, instruction following, detail preserving, and generation quality. For each perspective, we collected quantitative score in $0\sim 5$ and text descriptive feedback on the specific failure points in ground-truth edited images, resulting in a high-quality editing reward dataset, i.e., RewardEdit20K. 2) We further proposed a novel training framework to seamlessly integrate the metric output, regarded as multi-reward, into editing models to learn from the imperfect training triplets. During training, the reward scores and text descriptions are encoded as embeddings and fed into both the latent space and the U-Net of the editing models as auxiliary conditions. During inference, we set these additional conditions to the highest score with no text description for failure points, to aim at the best generation outcome. 3) We also build a challenging evaluation benchmark with real-world images/photos and diverse editing instructions, named as Real-Edit. Experiments indicate that our multi-reward conditioned model outperforms its no-reward counterpart on two popular editing pipelines, i.e., InsPix2Pix and SmartEdit.

Poster,Multi-Robot Motion Planning with Diffusion Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30630,"Yorai Shaoul, Itamar Mishani, Shivam Vats, Jiaoyang Li, Maxim Likhachev","Diffusion models have recently been successfully applied to a wide range of robotics applications for learning complex multi-modal behaviors from data. However, prior works have mostly been confined to single-robot and small-scale environments due to the high sample complexity of learning multi-robot diffusion models. In this paper, we propose a method for generating collision-free multi-robot trajectories that conform to underlying data distributions while using only single-robot data. Our algorithm, Multi-robot Multi-model planning Diffusion (MMD), does so by combining learned diffusion models with classical search-based techniques---generating data-driven motions under collision constraints. Scaling further, we show how to compose multiple diffusion models to plan in large environments where a single diffusion model fails to generalize well. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning for dozens of robots in a variety of simulated scenarios motivated by logistics environments."
Poster,Multi-Scale Fusion for Object Representation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28394,"Rongzhen Zhao, Vivienne Huiling Wang, Juho Kannala, Joni Pajarinen","Representing images or videos as object-level feature vectors, rather than pixel-level feature maps, facilitates advanced visual tasks.Object-Centric Learning (OCL) primarily achieves this by reconstructing the input under the guidance of Variational Autoencoder (VAE) intermediate representation to drive so-called slots to aggregate as much object information as possible.However, existing VAE guidance does not explicitly address that objects can vary in pixel sizes while models typically excel at specific pattern scales.We propose Multi-Scale Fusion (MSF) to enhance VAE guidance for OCL training. To ensure objects of all sizes fall within VAE's comfort zone, we adopt the image pyramid, which produces intermediate representations at multiple scales;To foster scale-invariance/variance in object super-pixels, we devise inter/intra-scale fusion, which augments low-quality object super-pixels of one scale with corresponding high-quality super-pixels from another scale.On standard OCL benchmarks, our technique improves mainstream methods, including state-of-the-art diffusion-based ones.The source code is available on https://github.com/Genera1Z/MultiScaleFusion."
Poster,"Multi-session, multi-task neural decoding from distinct cell-types and brain regions",https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30143,"Mehdi Azabou, Krystal Pan, Vinam Arora, Ian Knight, Eva Dyer, Blake A Richards","Recent work has shown that scale is important for improved brain decoding, with more data leading to greater decoding accuracy. However, large-scale decoding across many different datasets is challenging because neural circuits are heterogeneous---each brain region contains a unique mix of cellular sub-types, and the responses to different stimuli are diverse across regions and sub-types. It is unknown whether it is possible to pre-train and transfer brain decoding models between distinct tasks, cellular sub-types, and brain regions. To address these questions, we developed a multi-task transformer architecture and trained it on the entirety of the Allen Institute's Brain Observatory dataset. This dataset contains responses from over 100,000 neurons in 6 areas of the brains of mice, observed with two-photon calcium imaging, recorded while the mice observed different types of visual stimuli. Our results demonstrate that transfer is indeed possible -combining data from different sources is beneficial for a number of downstream decoding tasks. As well, we can transfer the model between regions and sub-types, demonstrating that there is in fact common information in diverse circuits that can be extracted by an appropriately designed model. Interestingly, we found that the model's latent representations showed clear distinctions between different brain regions and cellular sub-types, even though it was never given any information about these distinctions. Altogether, our work demonstrates that training a large-scale neural decoding model on diverse data is possible, and this provides a means of studying the differences and similarities between heterogeneous neural circuits."
Poster,Multi-Task Corrupted Prediction for Learning Robust Audio-Visual Speech Representation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29375,"Sungnyun Kim, Sungwoo Cho, Sangmin Bae, Kangwook Jang, Se-Young Yun","Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) incorporates auditory and visual modalities to improve recognition accuracy, particularly in noisy environments where audio-only speech systems are insufficient. While previous research has largely addressed audio disruptions, few studies have dealt with visual corruptions, e.g., lip occlusions or blurred videos, which are also detrimental. To address this real-world challenge, we propose CAV2vec, a novel self-supervised speech representation learning framework particularly designed to handle audio-visual joint corruption. CAV2vec employs a self-distillation approach with a corrupted prediction task, where the student model learns to predict clean targets, generated by the teacher model, with corrupted input frames. Specifically, we suggest a unimodal multi-task learning, which distills cross-modal knowledge and aligns the corrupted modalities, by predicting clean audio targets with corrupted videos, and clean video targets with corrupted audios. This strategy mitigates the dispersion in the representation space caused by corrupted modalities, leading to more reliable and robust audio-visual fusion. Our experiments on robust AVSR benchmarks demonstrate that the corrupted representation learning method significantly enhances recognition accuracy across generalized environments involving various types of corruption.

Poster,Multi-Task Dense Predictions via Unleashing the Power of Diffusion,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29497,"Yuqi Yang, Peng-Tao Jiang, Qibin Hou, Hao Zhang, Jinwei Chen, Bo Li","Diffusion models have exhibited extraordinary performance in dense prediction tasks. However, there are few works exploring the diffusion pipeline for multi-task dense predictions. In this paper, we unlock the potential of diffusion models in solving multi-task dense predictions and propose a novel diffusion-based method, called TaskDiffusion, which leverages the conditional diffusion process in the decoder. Instead of denoising the noisy labels for different tasks separately, we propose a novel joint denoising diffusion process to capture the task relations during denoising. To be specific, our method first encodes the task-specific labels into a task-integration feature space to unify the encoding strategy. This allows us to get rid of the cumbersome task-specific encoding process. In addition, we also propose a cross-task diffusion decoder conditioned on task-specific multi-level features, which can model the interactions among different tasks and levels explicitly while preserving efficiency. Experiments show that our TaskDiffusion outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for all dense prediction tasks on the widely-used PASCAL-Context and NYUD-v2 datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/YuqiYang213/TaskDiffusion."
Poster,Multiview Equivariance Improves 3D Correspondence Understanding with Minimal Feature Finetuning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30515,"Yang You, Yixin Li, Congyue Deng, Yue Wang, Leonidas Guibas","Vision foundation models, particularly the ViT family, have revolutionized image understanding by providing rich semantic features. However, despite their success in 2D comprehension, their abilities on grasping 3D spatial relationships are still unclear.In this work, we evaluate and enhance the 3D awareness of ViT-based models. We begin by systematically assessing their ability to learn 3D equivariant features, specifically examining the consistency of semantic embeddings across different viewpoints. Our findings indicate that improved 3D equivariance leads to better performance on various downstream tasks, including pose estimation, tracking, and semantic transfer. Building on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective finetuning strategy based on 3D correspondences, which significantly enhances the 3D understanding of existing vision models. Remarkably, even finetuning on a single object for just one iteration results in substantial performance gains. Code is available on https://github.com/qq456cvb/3DCorrEnhance."
Poster,MuPT: A Generative Symbolic Music Pretrained Transformer,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28712,"Xingwei Qu, yuelin bai, Yinghao MA, Ziya Zhou, Ka Man Lo, JIAHENG LIU, Ruibin Yuan, Lejun Min, Xueling Liu, Tianyu Zhang, Xeron Du, Shuyue Guo, Yiming Liang, Yizhi Li, Shangda Wu, Junting Zhou, Tianyu Zheng, Ziyang Ma, Fengze Han, Wei Xue, Gus Xia, Emmanouil Benetos, Xiang Yue, Chenghua Lin, Xu Tan, Wenhao Huang, Jie Fu, Ge Zhang","In this paper, we explore the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to the pre-training of music. While the prevalent use of MIDI in music modeling is well-established, our findings suggest that LLMs are inherently more compatible with ABC Notation, which aligns more closely with their design and strengths, thereby enhancing the model's performance in musical composition.To address the challenges associated with misaligned measures from different tracks during generation, we propose the development of a $\underline{S}$ynchronized $\underline{M}$ulti-$\underline{T}$rack ABC Notation ($\textbf{SMT-ABC Notation}$), which aims to preserve coherence across multiple musical tracks. Our contributions include a series of models capable of handling up to 8192 tokens, covering 90\% of the symbolic music data in our training set. Furthermore, we explore the implications of the $\underline{S}$ymbolic $\underline{M}$usic $\underline{S}$caling Law ($\textbf{SMS Law}$) on model performance. The results indicate a promising research direction in music generation, offering extensive resources for further research through our open-source contributions."
Poster,"MuseGNN: Forming Scalable, Convergent GNN Layers that Minimize a Sampling-Based Energy",https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30256,"Haitian Jiang, Renjie Liu, Zengfeng Huang, Yichuan Wang, Xiao Yan, Zhenkun Cai, Minjie Wang, David Wipf","Among the many variants of graph neural network (GNN) architectures capable of modeling data with cross-instance relations, an important subclass involves layers designed such that the forward pass iteratively reduces a graph-regularized energy function of interest. In this way, node embeddings produced at the output layer dually serve as both predictive features for solving downstream tasks (e.g., node classification) and energy function minimizers that inherit transparent, exploitable inductive biases and interpretability. However, scaling GNN architectures constructed in this way remains challenging, in part because the convergence of the forward pass may involve models with considerable depth. To tackle this limitation, we propose a sampling-based energy function and scalable GNN layers that iteratively reduce it, guided by convergence guarantees in certain settings. We also instantiate a full GNN architecture based on these designs, and the model achieves competitive accuracy and scalability when applied to the largest publicly-available node classification benchmark exceeding 1TB in size.

Poster,MUSE: Machine Unlearning Six-Way Evaluation for Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29559,"Weijia Shi, Jaechan Lee, Yangsibo Huang, Sadhika Malladi, Jieyu Zhao, Ari Holtzman, Daogao Liu, Luke Zettlemoyer, Noah Smith, Chiyuan Zhang","Language models (LMs) are trained on vast amounts of text data, which may include private and copyrighted content. Data owners may request the removal of their data from a trained model due to privacy or copyright concerns. However, exactly unlearning only these datapoints (i.e., retraining with the data removed) is intractable in modern-day models. This has led to the development of many approximate unlearning algorithms. The evaluation of the efficacy of these algorithms has traditionally been narrow in scope, failing to precisely quantify the success and practicality of the algorithm from the perspectives of both the model deployers and the data owners. We address this issue by proposing MUSE, a comprehensive machine unlearning evaluation benchmark that enumerates six diverse desirable properties for unlearned models: (1) no verbatim memorization, (2) no knowledge memorization, (3) no privacy leakage, (4) utility preservation on data not intended for removal, (5) scalability with respect to the size of removal requests, and (6) sustainability over sequential unlearning requests. Using these criteria, we benchmark how effectively eight popular unlearning algorithms on 7B-parameter LMs can unlearn Harry Potter books and news articles. Our results demonstrate that most algorithms can prevent verbatim memorization and knowledge memorization to varying degrees, but only one algorithm does not lead to severe privacy leakage. Furthermore, existing algorithms fail to meet deployer's expectations because they often degrade general model utility and also cannot sustainably accommodate successive unlearning requests or large-scale content removal. Our findings identify key issues with the practicality of existing unlearning algorithms on language models."
