Poster,Probing the Latent Hierarchical Structure of Data via Diffusion Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31261,"Antonio Sclocchi, Alessandro Favero, Noam Levi, Matthieu Wyart","High-dimensional data must be highly structured to be learnable. Although the compositional and hierarchical nature of data is often put forward to explain learnability, quantitative measurements establishing these properties are scarce. Likewise, accessing the latent variables underlying such a data structure remains a challenge. In this work, we show that forward-backward experiments in diffusion-based models, where data is noised and then denoised to generate new samples, are a promising tool to probe the latent structure of data. We predict in simple hierarchical models that, in this process, changes in data occur by correlated chunks, with a length scale that diverges at a noise level where a phase transition is known to take place. Remarkably, we confirm this prediction in both text and image datasets using state-of-the-art diffusion models. Our results show how latent variable changes manifest in the data and establish how to measure these effects in real data using diffusion models."
Poster,Problem-Parameter-Free Federated Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29194,"Wenjing Yan, Kai Zhang, Xiaolu Wang, Xuanyu Cao","Federated learning (FL) has garnered significant attention from academia and industry in recent years due to its advantages in data privacy, scalability, and communication efficiency. However, current FL algorithms face a critical limitation: their performance heavily depends on meticulously tuned hyperparameters, particularly the learning rate or stepsize. This manual tuning process is challenging in federated settings due to data heterogeneity and limited accessibility of local datasets. Consequently, the reliance on problem-specific parameters hinders the widespread adoption of FL and potentially compromises its performance in dynamic or diverse environments. To address this issue, we introduce PAdaMFed, a novel algorithm for nonconvex FL that carefully combines adaptive stepsize and momentum techniques. PAdaMFed offers two key advantages: 1) it operates autonomously without relying on problem-specific parameters; and 2) it manages data heterogeneity and partial participation without requiring heterogeneity bounds. Despite these benefits, PAdaMFed provides several strong theoretical guarantees: 1) It achieves state-of-the-art convergence rates with a sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ and communication complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ to obtain an accuracy of $||\nabla f\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)|| \leq \epsilon$, even using constant learning rates; 2) these complexities can be improved to the best-known $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ for sampling and $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ for communication when incorporating variance reduction; 3) it exhibits linear speedup with respect to the number of local update steps and participating clients at each global round. These attributes make PAdaMFed highly scalable and adaptable for various real-world FL applications. Extensive empirical evidence on both image classification and sentiment analysis tasks validates the efficacy of our approaches."
Poster,Procedural Knowledge in Pretraining Drives Reasoning in Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31190,"Laura Ruis, Maximilian Mozes, Juhan Bae, Siddhartha Rao Kamalakara, Dwaraknath Gnaneshwar, Acyr Locatelli, Robert Kirk, Tim Rocktaeschel, Edward Grefenstette, Max Bartolo","The capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) have been sketched out in great detail in recent years, providing an intriguing yet conflicting picture. On the one hand, LLMs demonstrate a general ability to solve problems. On the other hand, they show surprising reasoning gaps when compared to humans, casting doubt on the robustness of their generalisation strategies. The sheer volume of data used in the design of LLMs has precluded us from applying the method traditionally used to measure generalisation: train-test set separation. To overcome this, we study what kind of generalisation strategies LLMs employ when performing reasoning tasks by investigating the pretraining data they rely on. For two models of different sizes (7B and 35B) and 2.5B of their pretraining tokens, we identify what documents influence the model outputs for three simple mathematical reasoning tasks and contrast this to the data that are influential for answering factual questions. We find that, while the models rely on mostly distinct sets of data for each factual question, a document often has a similar influence across different reasoning questions within the same task, indicating the presence of procedural knowledge. We further find that the answers to factual questions often show up in the most influential data. However, for reasoning questions the answers usually do not show up as highly influential, nor do the answers to the intermediate reasoning steps. When we characterise the top ranked documents for the reasoning questions qualitatively, we confirm that the influential documents often contain procedural knowledge, like demonstrating how to obtain a solution using formulae or code. Our findings indicate that the approach to reasoning the models use is unlike retrieval, and more like a generalisable strategy that synthesises procedural knowledge from documents doing a similar form of reasoning."
Poster,Procedural Synthesis of Synthesizable Molecules,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29833,"Michael Sun, Alston Lo, Minghao Guo, Jie Chen, Connor Coley, Wojciech Matusik","Designing synthetically accessible molecules and recommending analogs to unsynthesizable molecules are important problems for accelerating molecular discovery. We reconceptualize both problems using ideas from program synthesis. Drawing inspiration from syntax-guided synthesis approaches, we decouple the syntactic skeleton from the semantics of a synthetic tree to create a bilevel framework for reasoning about the combinatorial space of synthesis pathways. Given a molecule we aim to generate analogs for, we iteratively refine its skeletal characteristics via Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations over the space of syntactic skeletons. Given a black-box oracle to optimize, we formulate a joint design space over syntactic templates and molecular descriptors and introduce evolutionary algorithms that optimize both syntactic and semantic dimensions synergistically. Our key insight is that once the syntactic skeleton is set, we can amortize over the search complexity of deriving the program's semantics by training policies to fully utilize the fixed horizon Markov Decision Process imposed by the syntactic template. We demonstrate performance advantages of our bilevel framework for synthesizable analog generation and synthesizable molecule design. Notably, our approach offers the user explicit control over the resources required to perform synthesis and biases the design space towards simpler solutions, making it particularly promising for autonomous synthesis platforms.

Poster,Process Reward Model with Q-value Rankings,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27847,"Wendi Li, Yixuan Li","Process Reward Modeling (PRM) is critical for complex reasoning and decision-making tasks where the accuracy of intermediate steps significantly influences the overall outcome. Existing PRM approaches, primarily framed as classification problems, employ cross-entropy loss to independently evaluate each step's correctness. This method can lead to suboptimal reward distribution and does not adequately address the interdependencies among steps. To address these limitations, we introduce the Process Q-value Model (PQM), a novel framework that redefines PRM in the context of a Markov Decision Process. PQM optimizes Q-value rankings based on a novel comparative loss function, enhancing the model's ability to capture the intricate dynamics among sequential decisions. This approach provides a more granular and theoretically grounded methodology for process rewards. Our extensive empirical evaluations across various sampling policies, language model backbones, and multi-step reasoning benchmarks show that PQM outperforms classification-based PRMs. The effectiveness of the comparative loss function is highlighted in our comprehensive ablation studies, confirming PQM’s practical efficacy and theoretical advantage."
Poster,Programming Refusal with Conditional Activation Steering,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29806,"Bruce W. Lee, Inkit Padhi, Karthikeyan Natesan Ramamurthy, Erik Miehling, Pierre Dognin, Manish Nagireddy, Amit Dhurandhar","LLMs have shown remarkable capabilities, but precisely controlling their response behavior remains challenging.Existing activation steering methods alter LLM behavior indiscriminately, limiting their practical applicability in settings where selective responses are essential, such as content moderation or domain-specific assistants.In this paper, we propose Conditional Activation Steering (CAST), which analyzes LLM activation patterns during inference to selectively apply or withhold activation steering based on the input context.Our method is based on the observation that different categories of prompts activate distinct patterns in the model's hidden states.Using CAST, one can systematically control LLM behavior with rules like ""if input is about hate speech or adult content, then refuse"" or ""if input is not about legal advice, then refuse.""This allows for selective modification of responses to specific content while maintaining normal responses to other content, all without requiring weight optimization.We release an open-source implementation of our framework."
Poster,Progressive Compositionality in Text-to-Image Generative Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29626,"Xu Han, Linghao Jin, Xiaofeng Liu, Paul Pu Liang","Despite the impressive text-to-image (T2I) synthesis capabilities of diffusion models, they often struggle to understand compositional relationships between objects and attributes, especially in complex settings. Existing approaches through building compositional architectures or generating difficult negative captions often assume a fixed prespecified compositional structure, which limits generalization to new distributions. In this paper, we argue that curriculum training is crucial to equipping generative models with a fundamental understanding of compositionality. To achieve this, we leverage large-language models (LLMs) to automatically compose complex scenarios and harness Visual-Question Answering (VQA) checkers to automatically curate a contrastive dataset, ConPair, consisting of 15k pairs of high-quality contrastive images. These pairs feature minimal visual discrepancies and cover a wide range of attribute categories, especially complex and natural scenarios. To learn effectively from these error cases (i.e., hard negative images), we propose EvoGen, a new multi-stage curriculum for contrastive learning of diffusion models. Through extensive experiments across a wide range of compositional scenarios, we showcase the effectiveness of our proposed framework on compositional T2I benchmarks."
Poster,Progressive Compression with Universally Quantized Diffusion Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30486,"Yibo Yang, Justus Will, Stephan Mandt","Diffusion probabilistic models have achieved mainstream success in many generative modeling tasks, from image generation to inverse problem solving. A distinct feature of these models is that they correspond to deep hierarchical latent variable models optimizing a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO) on the data likelihood. Drawing on a basic connection between likelihood modeling and compression, we explore the potential of diffusion models for progressive coding, resulting in a sequence of bits that can be incrementally transmitted and decoded with progressively improving reconstruction quality. Unlike prior work based on Gaussian diffusion or conditional diffusion models, we propose a new form of diffusion model with uniform noise in the forward process, whose negative ELBO corresponds to the end-to-end compression cost using universal quantization. We obtain promising first results on image compression, achieving competitive rate-distortion-realism results on a wide range of bit-rates with a single model, bringing neural codecs a step closer to practical deployment. Our code can be found at https://github.com/mandt-lab/uqdm."
Poster,Progressive distillation induces an implicit curriculum,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27848,"Abhishek Panigrahi, Bingbin Liu, Sadhika Malladi, Andrej Risteski, Surbhi Goel","Knowledge distillation leverages a teacher model to improve the training of a student model. A persistent challenge is that a better teacher does not always yield a better student, to which a common mitigation is to use additional supervision from several “intermediate” teachers. One empirically validated variant of this principle is progressive distillation, where the student learns from successive intermediate checkpoints of the teacher. Using sparse parity as a sandbox, we identify an implicit curriculum as one mechanism through which progressive distillation accelerates the student’s learning. This curriculum is available only through the intermediate checkpoints but not the final converged one, and imparts both empirical acceleration and a provable sample complexity benefit to the student. We then extend our investigation to Transformers trained on probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) and real-world pre-training datasets (Wikipedia and Books). Through probing the teacher model, we identify an analogous implicit curriculum where the model progressively learns features that capture longer context. Our theoretical and empirical findings on sparse parity, complemented by empirical observations on more complex tasks, highlight the benefit of progressive distillation via implicit curriculum across setups."
Poster,Progressive Mixed-Precision Decoding for Efficient LLM Inference,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29823,"Hao (Mark) Chen, Fuwen Tan, Alexandros Kouris, Royson Lee, Hongxiang Fan, Stylianos Venieris","In spite of the great potential of large language models (LLMs) across various tasks, their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to their excessive computational and memory demands. Quantization has emerged as an effective solution by storing weights in reduced precision. However, utilizing low precisions (i.e.~2/3-bit) to substantially alleviate the memory-boundedness of LLM decoding, still suffers from prohibitive performance drop. In this work, we argue that existing approaches fail to explore the diversity in computational patterns, redundancy, and sensitivity to approximations of the different phases of LLM inference, resorting to a uniform quantization policy throughout.Instead, we propose a novel phase-aware method that selectively allocates precision during different phases of LLM inference, achieving both strong context extraction during prefill and efficient memory bandwidth utilization during decoding. To further address the memory-boundedness of the decoding phase, we introduce Progressive Mixed-Precision Decoding (PMPD), a technique that enables the gradual lowering of precision deeper in the generated sequence, together with a spectrum of precision-switching schedulers that dynamically drive the precision-lowering decisions in either task-adaptive or prompt-adaptive manner. Extensive evaluation across diverse language tasks shows that when targeting Nvidia GPUs, PMPD achieves 1.4$-$12.2$\times$ speedup in matrix-vector multiplications over fp16 models, while when targeting an LLM-optimized NPU, our approach delivers a throughput gain of 3.8$-$8.0$\times$ over fp16 models and up to 1.54$\times$ over uniform quantization approaches while preserving the output quality."
