Poster,Context Clues: Evaluating Long Context Models for Clinical Prediction Tasks on EHR Data,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27657,"Michael Wornow, Suhana Bedi, Miguel Angel Fuentes Hernandez, Ethan Steinberg, Jason Fries, Christopher Re, Sanmi Koyejo, Nigam Shah","Foundation Models (FMs) trained on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have achieved state-of-the-art results on numerous clinical prediction tasks. However, prior EHR FMs typically have context windows of $<$1k tokens, which prevents them from modeling full patient EHRs which can exceed 10k's of events. For making clinical predictions, both model performance and robustness to the unique properties of EHR data are crucial. Recent advancements in subquadratic long-context architectures (e.g. Mamba) offer a promising solution. However, their application to EHR data has not been well-studied. We address this gap by presenting the first systematic evaluation of the effect of context length on modeling EHR data. We find that longer context models improve predictive performance -- our Mamba-based model surpasses the prior state-of-the-art on 9/14 tasks on the EHRSHOT prediction benchmark. Additionally, we measure robustness to three unique, previously underexplored properties of EHR data: (1) the prevalence of ``copy-forwarded"" diagnoses which create artificial token repetition in EHR sequences; (2) the irregular time intervals between EHR events which can lead to a wide range of timespans within a context window; and (3) the natural increase in disease complexity over time which makes later tokens in the EHR harder to predict than earlier ones. Stratifying our EHRSHOT results, we find that higher levels of each property correlate negatively with model performance (e.g., a 14% higher Brier loss between the least and most irregular patients), but that longer context models are more robust to more extreme levels of these properties. Our work highlights the potential for using long-context architectures to model EHR data, and offers a case study on how to identify and quantify new challenges in modeling sequential data motivated by domains outside of natural language. We release all of our model checkpoints and code."
Poster,ContextGNN: Beyond Two-Tower Recommendation Systems,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28384,"Yiwen Yuan, Zecheng Zhang, Xinwei He, Akihiro Nitta, Weihua Hu, Manan Shah, Blaz Stojanovic, Shenyang(Andy) Huang, Jan E Lenssen, Jure Leskovec, Matthias Fey","Recommendation systems predominantly utilize two-tower architectures, which evaluate user-item rankings through the inner product of their respective embeddings. However, one key limitation of two-tower models is that they learn a pair-agnostic representation of users and items. In contrast, pair-wise representations either scale poorly due to their quadratic complexity or are too restrictive on the candidate pairs to rank. To address these issues, we introduce Context-based Graph Neural Networks (ContextGNNs), a novel deep learning architecture for link prediction in recommendation systems. The method employs a pair-wise representation technique for familiar items situated within a user's local subgraph, while leveraging two-tower representations to facilitate the recommendation of exploratory items. A final network then predicts how to fuse both pair-wise and two-tower recommendations into a single ranking of items. We demonstrate that ContextGNN is able to adapt to different data characteristics and outperforms existing methods, both traditional and GNN-based, on a diverse set of practical recommendation tasks, improving performance by 20\% on average."
Poster,Context-Parametric Inversion: Why Instruction Finetuning May Not Actually Improve Context Reliance,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29609,"Sachin Goyal, Christina Baek, Zico Kolter, Aditi Raghunathan","Large Language Model's are instruction-finetuned to enhance their ability to follow user instructions and better comprehend input context. Still, they often struggle to follow the input context, especially when it contradicts model's parametric knowledge. This manifests as various failures, such as hallucinations where a model inserts outdated or unwarranted facts into its response. In this work, we observe an intriguing phenomenon: the context reliance of the model decreases as instruction finetuning progresses, $\textit{despite an initial expected increase}$. We call this phenomenon as the $\textbf{context-parametric inversion}$. This is surprising, as one would expect instruction tuning to improve the model's ability to follow input instructions.  We observe this behavior on multiple general purpose instruction tuning datasets such as TULU, Alpaca and Ultrachat, across multiple model families like Llama, Mistral and Pythia.  We perform various controlled studies to eliminate some simple hypothesis for this observed behavior and isolate what datapoints cause this counter-intuitive behavior. We then analyze the phenomenon theoretically, to explain why context reliance varies across the trajectory of finetuning. We tie the observed context-parametric inversion to the properties of the finetuning data, which provides us with some potential mitigation strategies that provide limited but insightful gains."
Poster,Context Steering: Controllable Personalization at Inference Time,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27781,"Zhiyang He, Sashrika Pandey, Mariah Schrum, Anca Dragan","To deliver high-quality, personalized responses, large language models (LLMs) must effectively incorporate context — personal, demographic, and cultural information specific to an end-user. For example, asking the model to explain Newton's second law with the context ""I am a toddler'' should produce a response different from when the context is ""I am a physics professor''. However, leveraging the context in practice is a nuanced and challenging task, and is often dependent on the specific situation or user base. The model must strike a balance between providing specific, personalized responses and maintaining general applicability. Current solutions, such as prompt-engineering and fine-tuning, require collection of contextually appropriate responses as examples, making them time-consuming and less flexible to use across different contexts. In this work, we introduce Context Steering (CoS) —a simple, training-free decoding approach that amplifies the influence of the context in next token predictions. CoS computes contextual influence by comparing the output probabilities from two LLM forward passes: one that includes the context and one that does not. By linearly scaling the contextual influence, CoS allows practitioners to flexibly control the degree of personalization for different use cases. We show that CoS can be applied to autoregressive LLMs, and demonstrates strong performance in personalized recommendations. Additionally, we show that CoS can function as a Bayesian Generative model to infer and quantify correlations between open-ended texts, broadening its potential applications."
Poster,Contextual Document Embeddings,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29341,"John X. Morris, Alexander Rush","Dense document embeddings are central to neural retrieval. The dominant paradigm is to train and construct embeddings by running encoders directly on individual documents. In this work, we argue that these embeddings, while effective, are implicitly out-of-context for targeted use cases of retrieval, and that a contextualized document embedding should take into account both the document and neighboring documents in context - analogous to contextualized word embeddings. We propose two complementary methods for contextualized document embeddings: first, an alternative contrastive learning objective that explicitly incorporates the document neighbors into the intra-batch contextual loss; second, a new contextual architecture that explicitly encodes neighbor document information into the encoded representation. Results show that both methods achieve better performance than biencoders in several settings, with differences especially pronounced out-of-domain. We achieve state-of-the-art results on the MTEB benchmark with no hard negative mining, score distillation, dataset-specific instructions, intra-GPU example-sharing, or extremely large batch sizes.  Our method can be applied to improve performance on any contrastive learning dataset and any biencoder."
Poster,Contextualizing biological perturbation experiments through language,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30942,"Menghua (Rachel) Wu, Russell Littman, Jacob Levine, Lin Qiu, Tommaso Biancalani, David Richmond, Jan-Christian Huetter","High-content perturbation experiments allow scientists to probe biomolecular systems at unprecedented resolution, but experimental and analysis costs pose significant barriers to widespread adoption. Machine learning has the potential to guide efficient exploration of the perturbation space and extract novel insights from these data. However, current approaches neglect the semantic richness of the relevant biology, and their objectives are misaligned with downstream biological analyses. In this paper, we hypothesize that large language models (LLMs) present a natural medium for representing complex biological relationships and rationalizing experimental outcomes. We propose PerturbQA, a benchmark for structured reasoning over perturbation experiments. Unlike current benchmarks that primarily interrogate existing knowledge, PerturbQA is inspired by open problems in perturbation modeling: prediction of differential expression and change of direction for unseen perturbations, and gene set enrichment. We evaluate state-of-the-art machine learning and statistical approaches for modeling perturbations, as well as standard LLM reasoning strategies, and we find that current methods perform poorly on PerturbQA. As a proof of feasibility, we introduce Summer (SUMMarize, retrievE, and answeR, a simple, domain-informed LLM framework that matches or exceeds the current state-of-the-art. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/genentech/PerturbQA."
Poster,Contextual Self-paced Learning for Weakly Supervised Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27737,"Akash Kumar, Zsolt Kira, Yogesh S Rawat","In this work, we focus on Weakly Supervised Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (WSTVG). It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects  spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding."
Poster,Continual Slow-and-Fast Adaptation of Latent Neural Dynamics (CoSFan): Meta-Learning What-How & When to Adapt,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30443,"Ryan Missel, Linwei Wang","An increasing interest in learning to forecast for time-series of high-dimensional observations is the ability to adapt to systems with diverse underlying dynamics. Access to observations that define a stationary distribution of these systems is often unattainable, as the underlying dynamics may change over time. Naively training or retraining models at each shift may lead to catastrophic forgetting about previously-seen systems. We present a new continual meta-learning (CML) framework to realize continual slow-and fast adaptation of latent dynamics (CoSFan). We leverage a feed-forward meta-model to infer *what* the current system is and *how* to adapt a latent dynamics function to it, enabling *fast adaptation* to specific dynamics. We then develop novel strategies to automatically detect *when* a shift of data distribution occurs, with which to identify its underlying dynamics and its relation with previously-seen dynamics. In combination with fixed-memory experience replay mechanisms, this enables continual *slow update* of the *what-how* meta-model. Empirical studies demonstrated that both the meta- and continual-learning component was critical for learning to forecast across non-stationary distributions of diverse dynamics systems, and the feed-forward meta-model combined with task-aware/-relational continual learning strategies significantly outperformed existing CML alternatives."
Poster,Continuity-Preserving  Convolutional Autoencoders for Learning Continuous Latent Dynamical Models from Images,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29910,"Aiqing Zhu, Yuting Pan, Qianxiao Li","Continuous dynamical systems are cornerstones of many scientific and engineering disciplines.While machine learning offers powerful tools to model these systems from trajectory data, challenges arise when these trajectories are captured as images, resulting in pixel-level observations that are discrete in nature.Consequently, a naive application of a convolutional autoencoder can result in latent coordinates that are discontinuous in time.To resolve this, we propose continuity-preserving convolutional autoencoders (CpAEs) to learn continuous latent states and their corresponding continuous latent dynamical models from discrete image frames. We present a mathematical formulation for learning dynamics from image frames, which illustrates issues with previous approaches and motivates our methodology based on promoting the continuity of convolution filters, thereby preserving the continuity of the latent states.This approach enables CpAEs to produce latent states that evolve continuously with the underlying dynamics, leading to more accurate latent dynamical models.Extensive experiments across various scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of CpAEs."
Poster,Continuous Autoregressive Modeling with Stochastic Monotonic Alignment for Speech Synthesis,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29023,"Weiwei Lin, Chenhang HE","We propose a novel autoregressive modeling approach for speech synthesis, combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a multi-modal latent space and an autoregressive model that uses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) as the conditional probability distribution. Unlike previous methods that rely on residual vector quantization, our model leverages continuous speech representations from the VAE's latent space, greatly simplifying the training and inference pipelines. We also introduce a stochastic monotonic alignment mechanism to enforce strict monotonic alignments. Our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art autoregressive model VALL-E in both subjective and objective evaluations, achieving these results with only 10.3\% of VALL-E's parameters. This demonstrates the potential of continuous speech language models as a more efficient alternative to existing quantization-based speech language models.
