Poster,Mix-CPT: A Domain Adaptation Framework via Decoupling Knowledge Learning and Format Alignment,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28784,"Jinhao Jiang, Junyi Li, Xin Zhao, Yang Song, Tao Zhang, Ji-Rong Wen","Adapting large language models (LLMs) to specialized domains typically requires domain-specific corpora for continual pre-training to facilitate knowledge memorization and related instructions for fine-tuning to apply this knowledge.However, this method may lead to inefficient knowledge memorization due to a lack of awareness of knowledge utilization during the continual pre-training and demands LLMs to simultaneously learn knowledge utilization and format alignment with divergent training objectives during the fine-tuning.To enhance the domain adaptation of LLMs, we revise this process and propose a new domain adaptation framework including domain knowledge learning and general format alignment, called \emph{Mix-CPT}. Specifically, we first conduct a knowledge mixture continual pre-training that concurrently focuses on knowledge memorization and utilization. To avoid catastrophic forgetting, we further propose a logit swap self-distillation constraint. By leveraging the knowledge and capabilities acquired during continual pre-training, we then efficiently perform instruction tuning and alignment with a few general training samples to achieve format alignment.Extensive experiments show that our proposed \emph{Mix-CPT} framework can simultaneously improve the task-solving capabilities of LLMs on the target and general domains."
Poster,MixEval-X: Any-to-any Evaluations from Real-world Data Mixture,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28740,"Jinjie Ni, Yifan Song, Deepanway Ghosal, Bo Li, David Junhao Zhang, Xiang Yue, Fuzhao Xue, Yuntian Deng, Andy Zheng, Kaichen Zhang, Mahir Shah, Kabir Jain, Yang You, Michael Qizhe Shieh","Perceiving and generating diverse modalities are crucial for AI models to effectively learn from and engage with real-world signals, necessitating reliable evaluations for their development. We identify two major issues in current evaluations: (1) inconsistent standards, shaped by different communities with varying protocols and maturity levels; and (2) significant query, grading, and generalization biases. To address these, we introduce MixEval-X, the first any-to-any, real-world benchmark designed to optimize and standardize evaluations across diverse input and output modalities. We propose multi-modal benchmark mixture and adaptation-rectification pipelines to reconstruct real-world task distributions, ensuring evaluations generalize effectively to real-world use cases. Extensive meta-evaluations show our approach effectively aligns benchmark samples with real-world task distributions. Meanwhile, MixEval-X's model rankings correlate strongly with that of crowd-sourced real-world evaluations (up to 0.98) while being much more efficient. We provide comprehensive leaderboards to rerank existing models and organizations and offer insights to enhance understanding of multi-modal evaluations and inform future research."
Poster,Mix-LN: Unleashing the Power of Deeper Layers by Combining Pre-LN and Post-LN,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30583,"Pengxiang Li, Lu Yin, Shiwei Liu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet recent findings reveal that their deeper layers often contribute minimally and can be pruned without affecting overall performance.  While some view this as an opportunity for model compression, we identify it as a training shortfall rooted in the widespread use of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN). We demonstrate that Pre-LN, commonly employed in models like GPT and LLaMA, leads to diminished gradient norms in its deeper layers, reducing their effectiveness. In contrast, Post-Layer Normalization (Post-LN) preserves larger gradient norms in deeper layers but suffers from vanishing gradients in earlier layers. To address this, we introduce Mix-LN, a novel normalization technique that combines the strengths of Pre-LN and Post-LN within the same model. Mix-LN applies Post-LN to the earlier layers and Pre-LN to the deeper layers, ensuring more uniform gradient norms across layers. This allows all parts of the network—both shallow and deep layers—to contribute effectively to training. Extensive experiments with various model sizes demonstrate that Mix-LN consistently outperforms both Pre-LN and Post-LN, promoting more balanced, healthier gradient norms throughout the network, and enhancing the overall quality of LLM pre-training. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models pre-trained with Mix-LN learn better compared to those using Pre-LN or Post-LN during supervised fine-tuning, highlighting the critical importance of high-quality deep layers. By effectively addressing the inefficiencies of deep layers in current LLMs, Mix-LN unlocks their potential, enhancing model capacity without increasing model size.

Poster,MixMax: Distributional Robustness in Function Space via Optimal Data Mixtures,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28992,"Anvith Thudi, Chris Maddison","Machine learning models are often required to perform well across several pre-defined settings, such as a set of user groups. Worst-case performance is a common metric to capture this requirement, and is the objective of group distributionally robust optimization (group DRO). Unfortunately, these methods struggle when the loss is non-convex in the parameters, or the model class is non-parametric. Here, we make a classical move to address this: we reparameterize group DRO from parameter space to function space, which results in a number of advantages. First, we show that group DRO over the space of bounded functions admits a minimax theorem. Second, for cross-entropy and mean squared error, we show that the minimax optimal mixture distribution is the solution of a simple convex optimization problem. Thus, provided one is working with a model class of universal function approximators, group DRO can be solved by a convex optimization problem followed by a classical risk minimization problem. We call our method MixMax. In our experiments, we found that MixMax matched or outperformed the standard group DRO baselines, and in particular, MixMax improved the performance of XGBoost over the only baseline, data balancing, for variations of the ACSIncome and CelebA annotations datasets."
Poster,Mixture Compressor for Mixture-of-Experts LLMs Gains More,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28749,"Wei Huang, Yue Liao, Jianhui Liu, Ruifei He, Haoru Tan, Shiming Zhang, Hongsheng Li, Si Liu, XIAOJUAN QI","Mixture-of-Experts large language models (MoE-LLMs) marks a significant step forward of language models, however, they encounter two critical challenges in practice: 1) expert parameters lead to considerable memory consumption and loading latency; and 2) the current activated experts are redundant, as many tokens may only require a single expert. Motivated by these issues, we investigate the MoE-LLMs and make two key observations: a) different experts exhibit varying behaviors on activation reconstruction error, routing scores, and activated frequencies, highlighting their differing importance, and b) not all tokens are equally important-- only a small subset is critical. Building on these insights, we propose MC, a training-free Mixture-Compressor for MoE-LLMs, which leverages the significance of both experts and tokens to achieve an extreme compression. First, to mitigate storage and loading overheads, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision Quantization (PMQ), which formulates the adaptive bit-width allocation as a Linear Programming (LP) problem, where the objective function balances multi-factors reflecting the importance of each expert. Additionally, we develop Online Dynamic Pruning (ODP),  which identifies important tokens to retain and dynamically select activated experts for other tokens during inference to optimize efficiency while maintaining performance. Our MC integrates static quantization and dynamic pruning to collaboratively achieve extreme compression for MoE-LLMs with less accuracy loss, ensuring an optimal trade-off between performance and efficiency Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, at 2.54 bits, MC compresses 76.6% of the model, with only a 3.8% average accuracy loss. During dynamic inference, we further reduce activated parameters by 15%, with a performance drop of less than 0.6%. Remarkably, MC even surpasses floating-point 13b dense LLMs with significantly smaller parameter sizes, suggesting that mixture compression in MoE-LLMs has the potential to outperform both comparable and larger dense LLMs.  Our code isavailable at https://github.com/Aaronhuang-778/MC-MoE"
Poster,Mixture-of-Agents Enhances Large Language Model Capabilities,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28787,"Junlin Wang, Jue Wang, Ben Athiwaratkun, Ce Zhang, James Y Zou","Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial capabilities in natural language understanding and generation tasks. With the growing number of LLMs, how to harness the collective expertise of multiple LLMs is an exciting open direction. Toward this goal, we propose a new approach that leverages the collective strengths of multiple LLMs through a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) methodology. In our approach, we construct a layered MoA architecture wherein each layer comprises multiple LLM agents. Each agent takes all the outputs from agents in the previous layer as auxiliary information in generating its response. MoA models achieves state-of-art performance on AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench, and FLASK, surpassing GPT-4 Omni. For example, our MoA using only open-source LLMs achieves a score of 65.1% on AlpacaEval 2.0 compared to 57.5% by GPT-4 Omni."
Poster,Mixture of Attentions For Speculative Decoding,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29634,"Matthieu Zimmer, Milan Gritta, Gerasimos Lampouras, Haitham Bou Ammar, Jun Wang","The growth in the number of parameters of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a significant surge in computational requirements, making them challenging and costly to deploy.Speculative decoding (SD) leverages smaller models to efficiently propose future tokens, which are then verified by the LLM in parallel.Small models that utilise activations from the LLM currently achieve the fastest decoding speeds.However, we identify several limitations of SD models including the lack of on-policyness during training and partial observability. To address these shortcomings, we propose a more grounded architecture for small models by introducing a Mixture of Attentions for SD.Our novel architecture can be applied in two scenarios: a conventional single device deployment and a novel client-server deployment where the small model is hosted on a consumer device and the LLM on a server.In a single-device scenario, we demonstrate state-of-the-art speedups improving EAGLE-2 by 9.5% and its acceptance length by 25%.In a client-server setting, our experiments demonstrate: 1) state-of-the-art latencies with minimal calls to the server for different network conditions, and 2) in the event of a complete disconnection, our approach can maintain higher accuracy compared to other SD methods and demonstrates advantages over API calls to LLMs, which would otherwise be unable to continue the generation process."
Poster,Mixture of Experts Made Personalized: Federated Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27771,"Jun Luo, Chen Chen, Shandong Wu","Federated prompt learning benefits federated learning with CLIP-like Vision-Language Model's (VLM's) robust representation learning ability through prompt learning. However, current federated prompt learning methods are habitually restricted to the traditional FL paradigm, where the participating clients are generally only allowed to download a single globally aggregated model from the server. While justifiable for training full-sized models under federated settings, in this work, we argue that this paradigm is ill-suited for lightweight prompts. By facilitating the clients to download multiple pre-aggregated prompts as fixed non-local experts, we propose Personalized Federated Mixture of Adaptive Prompts (pFedMoAP), a novel FL framework that personalizes the prompt learning process through the lens of Mixture of Experts (MoE). pFedMoAP implements a local attention-based gating network that learns to generate enhanced text features for better alignment with local image data, benefiting from both local and downloaded non-local adaptive prompt experts. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets under various federated settings demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed pFedMoAP algorithm. The code is available at https://github.com/ljaiverson/pFedMoAP."
Poster,Mixture of In-Context Prompters for Tabular PFNs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31124,"Derek Xu, Olcay Cirit, Reza Asadi, Yizhou Sun, Wei Wang","Recent benchmarks find In-Context Learning (ICL) outperforms both deep learning and tree-based algorithms on small tabular datasets. However, on larger datasets, ICL for tabular learning suffers in both efficiency and effectiveness. In terms of efficiency, transformers incur linear space and quadratic time complexity w.r.t. context size. In terms of effectiveness, contexts at inference encounter distribution shift compared to contexts from pretraining. We propose MixturePFN, which extends Sparse Mixture of Experts to the state-of-the-art ICL for tabular learning model. Specifically, MixturePFN finetunes a specialized ICL expert on each cluster of tabular data and routes new test samples to appropriate experts at inference. MixturePFN supports constant-size contexts by splitting large training datasets into more manageable clusters. MixturePFN addresses distribution shift by finetuning an expert on each training dataset cluster via bootstrapping. Extensive experimental results shows MixturePFN outperforms 19 baselines both in mean rank and as the Condorcet winner across 36 diverse tabular datasets under both accuracy and F1 score with statistical significance."
Poster,Mixture of Parrots: Experts improve memorization more than reasoning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30684,"Samy Jelassi, Clara Mohri, David Brandfonbrener, Alex Gu, Nikhil Vyas, Nikhil Anand, David Alvarez-Melis, Yuanzhi Li, Sham Kakade, Eran Malach","The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture enables a significant increase in the total number of model parameters with minimal computational overhead. However, it is not clear what performance tradeoffs, if any, exist between MoEs and standard dense transformers.In this paper, we show that as we increase the number of experts (while fixing the number of active parameters), the memorization performance consistently increases while the reasoning capabilities saturate. We begin by analyzing the theoretical limitations of MoEs at reasoning. We prove that there exist graph  problems that cannot be solved by any number of experts of a certain width; however, the same task can be easily solved by a dense model with a slightly larger width. On the other hand, we find that on memory-intensive tasks, MoEs can effectively leverage a small number of active parameters with a large number of experts to memorize the data. We empirically validate these findings on synthetic graph problems and memory-intensive closed book retrieval tasks. Lastly, we  pre-train a series of MoEs and dense transformers and evaluate them on commonly used benchmarks in math and natural language. We find that increasing the number of experts helps solve knowledge-intensive tasks, but fails to yield the same benefits for reasoning tasks."
