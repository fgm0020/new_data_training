Poster,Iterative Substructure Extraction for Molecular Relational Learning with Interactive Graph Information Bottleneck,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31059,"Shuai Zhang, Junfeng Fang, Xuqiang Li, Hongxin Xiang, Jun Xia, Ye Wei, Wenjie Du, Yang Wang","Molecular relational learning (MRL) seeks to understand the interaction behaviors between molecules, a pivotal task in domains such as drug discovery and materials science. Recently, extracting core substructures and modeling their interactions have emerged as mainstream approaches within machine learning-assisted methods. However, these methods still exhibit some limitations, such as insufficient consideration of molecular interactions or capturing substructures that include excessive noise, which hampers precise core substructure extraction.To address these challenges, we present an integrated dynamic framework called Iterative Substructure Extraction (ISE). ISE employs the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for MRL tasks, where the core substructures of interacting molecules are treated as latent variables and model parameters, respectively. Through iterative refinement, ISE gradually narrows the interactions from the entire molecular structures to just the core substructures.Moreover, to ensure the extracted substructures are concise and compact, we propose the Interactive Graph Information Bottleneck (IGIB) theory, which focuses on capturing the most influential yet minimal interactive substructures. In summary, our approach, guided by the IGIB theory, achieves precise substructure extraction within the ISE framework and is encapsulated in the IGIB-ISE}Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art baselines across various tasks in terms of accuracy, generalizability, and interpretability."
Poster,IterComp: Iterative Composition-Aware Feedback Learning from Model Gallery for Text-to-Image Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30983,"Xinchen Zhang, Ling Yang, Guohao Li, YaQi Cai, xie jiake, Yong Tang, Yujiu Yang, Mengdi Wang, Bin CUI","Advanced diffusion models like Stable Diffusion 3, Omost, and FLUX have made notable strides in compositional text-to-image generation. However, these methods typically exhibit distinct strengths for compositional generation, with some excelling in handling attribute binding and others in spatial relationships. This disparity highlights the need for an approach that can leverage the complementary strengths of various models to comprehensively improve the composition capability. To this end, we introduce IterComp, a novel framework that aggregates composition-aware model preferences from multiple models and employs an iterative feedback learning approach to enhance compositional generation. Specifically, we curate a gallery of six powerful open-source diffusion models and evaluate their three key compositional metrics: attribute binding, spatial relationships, and non-spatial relationships. Based on these metrics, we develop a composition-aware model preference dataset comprising numerous image-rank pairs to train composition-aware reward models. Then, we propose an iterative feedback learning method to enhance compositionality in a closed-loop manner, enabling the progressive self-refinement of both the base diffusion model and reward models over multiple iterations. Detailed theoretical proof demonstrates the effectiveness of this method. Extensive experiments demonstrate our significant superiority over previous methods, particularly in multi-category object composition and complex semantic alignment. IterComp opens new research avenues in reward feedback learning for diffusion models and compositional generation. Code: https://github.com/YangLing0818/IterComp"
Poster,IterGen: Iterative Semantic-aware Structured LLM Generation with Backtracking,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29157,"Shubham Dipak Ugare, Rohan Gumaste, Tarun Suresh, Gagandeep Singh, Sasa Misailovic","Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for tasks such as natural language and code generation, but their outputs often suffer from issues like hallucination, toxicity, and incorrect results. Current libraries for structured LLM generation rely on left-to-right decoding without support for backtracking, limiting the ability to correct or refine outputs mid-generation. To address this, we introduce IterGen, a user-friendly library for iterative, grammar-guided LLM generation that enables users to move both forward and backward within the generated output based on grammar symbols. By leveraging a symbol-to-position mapping and maintaining the key-value (KV) cache state, IterGen ensures efficient and structured generation while allowing for corrections during the process. We demonstrate IterGen's effectiveness in two important applications: reducing privacy leakage in LLM outputs, improving the accuracy of LLM-generated SQL and Vega-Lite queries.Our code and additional resources are available at https://structuredllm.com."
Poster,It Helps to Take a Second Opinion: Teaching Smaller LLMs To Deliberate Mutually via Selective Rationale Optimisation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29886,"Sohan Patnaik, Milan Aggarwal, Sumit Bhatia, Balaji Krishnamurthy","Very large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have shown the ability to handle complex tasks by generating and self-refining step-by-step rationales. Smaller language models (SLMs), typically with < 13B parameters, have been improved by using the data generated from very-large LMs through knowledge distillation. However, various practical constraints such as API costs, copyright, legal and ethical policies restrict using large (often opaque) models to train smaller models for commercial use. Limited success has been achieved at improving the ability of an SLM to explore the space of possible rationales and evaluate them by itself through self-deliberation. To address this, we propose COALITION, a trainable framework that facilitates interaction between two variants of the same SLM and trains them to generate and refine rationales optimized for the end-task. The variants exhibit different behaviors to produce a set of diverse candidate rationales during the generation and refinement steps. The model is then trained via Selective Rationale Optimization (SRO) to prefer generating rationale candidates that maximize the likelihood of producing the ground-truth answer. During inference, COALITION employs a controller to select the suitable variant for generating and refining the rationales. On five different datasets covering mathematical problems, commonsense reasoning, and natural language inference, COALITION outperforms several baselines by up to 5%. Our ablation studies reveal that cross-communication between the two variants performs better than using the single model to self-refine the rationales. We also demonstrate the applicability of COALITION for LMs of varying scales (4B to 14B parameters) and model families (Mistral, Llama, Qwen, Phi). We release the code for this work here."
Poster,IV-mixed Sampler: Leveraging Image Diffusion Models for Enhanced Video Synthesis,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30150,"Shitong Shao, zikai zhou, Lichen Bai, Haoyi Xiong, Zeke Xie","Exploring suitable solutions to improve performance by increasing the computational cost of inference in visual diffusion models is a highly promising direction. Sufficient prior studies have demonstrated that correctly scaling up computation in the sampling process can successfully lead to improved generation quality, enhanced image editing, and compositional generalization. While there have been rapid advancements in developing inference-heavy algorithms for improved image generation, relatively little work has explored inference scaling laws in video diffusion models (VDMs). Furthermore, existing research shows only minimal performance gains that are perceptible to the naked eye. To address this, we design a novel training-free algorithm IV-Mixed Sampler that leverages the strengths of image diffusion models (IDMs) to assist VDMs surpass their current capabilities. The core of IV-Mixed Sampler is to use IDMs to significantly enhance the quality of each video frame and VDMs ensure the temporal coherence of the video during the sampling process. Our experiments have demonstrated that IV-Mixed Sampler achieves state-of-the-art performance on 4 benchmarks including UCF-101-FVD, MSR-VTT-FVD, Chronomagic-Bench-150/1649, and VBench. For example, the open-source Animatediff with IV-Mixed Sampler reduces the UMT-FVD score from 275.2 to 228.6, closing to 223.1 from the closed-source Pika-2.0."
Poster,Jailbreak Antidote: Runtime Safety-Utility Balance via Sparse Representation Adjustment in Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28150,"Guobin Shen, Dongcheng Zhao, Yiting Dong, Xiang He, Yi Zeng","As large language models (LLMs) become integral to various applications, ensuring both their safety and utility is paramount. Jailbreak attacks, which manipulate LLMs into generating harmful content, pose significant challenges to this balance. Existing defenses, such as prompt engineering and safety fine-tuning, often introduce computational overhead, increase inference latency, and lack runtime flexibility. Moreover, overly restrictive safety measures can degrade model utility by causing refusals of benign queries. In this paper, we introduce *Jailbreak Antidote*, a method that enables real-time adjustment of LLM safety preferences by manipulating a sparse subset of the model's internal states during inference. By shifting the model's hidden representations along a safety direction with varying strengths, we achieve flexible control over the safety-utility balance without additional token overhead or inference delays. Our analysis reveals that safety-related information in LLMs is sparsely distributed; adjusting approximately *5\%* of the internal state is as effective as modifying the entire state. Extensive experiments on nine LLMs (ranging from 2 billion to 72 billion parameters), evaluated against ten jailbreak attack methods and compared with six defense strategies, validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. By directly manipulating internal states during reasoning, *Jailbreak Antidote* offers a lightweight, scalable solution that enhances LLM safety while preserving utility, opening new possibilities for real-time safety mechanisms in widely-deployed AI systems."
Poster,Jailbreaking as a Reward Misspecification Problem,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27994,"Zhihui Xie, Jiahui Gao, Lei Li, Zhenguo Li, Qi Liu, Lingpeng Kong","The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns about their safety and reliability, particularly regarding their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a new perspective that attributes this vulnerability to reward misspecification during the alignment process. This misspecification occurs when the reward function fails to accurately capture the intended behavior, leading to misaligned model outputs. We introduce a metric ReGap to quantify the extent of reward misspecification and demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness in detecting harmful backdoor prompts. Building upon these insights, we present ReMiss, a system for automated red teaming that generates adversarial prompts in a reward-misspecified space. ReMiss achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates on the AdvBench benchmark  against various target aligned LLMs while preserving the human readability of the generated prompts. Furthermore, these attacks on open-source models demonstrate high transferability to closed-source models like GPT-4o and out-of-distribution tasks from HarmBench. Detailed analysis highlights the unique advantages of the proposed reward misspecification objective compared to previous methods, offering new insights for improving LLM safety and robustness."
Poster,Jailbreaking Leading Safety-Aligned LLMs with Simple Adaptive Attacks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28755,"Maksym Andriushchenko, francesco croce, Nicolas Flammarion","We show that even the most recent safety-aligned LLMs are not robust to simple *adaptive* jailbreaking attacks. First, we demonstrate how to successfully leverage access to *logprobs* for jailbreaking: we initially design an adversarial prompt template (sometimes adapted to the target LLM), and then we apply random search on a suffix to maximize a target logprob (e.g., of the token *``Sure''*), potentially with multiple restarts. In this way, we achieve 100\% attack success rate---according to GPT-4 as a judge---on Vicuna-13B, Mistral-7B, Phi-3-Mini, Nemotron-4-340B, Llama-2-Chat-7B/13B/70B, Llama-3-Instruct-8B, Gemma-7B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and R2D2 from HarmBench that was adversarially trained against the GCG attack. We also show how to jailbreak *all* Claude models---that do not expose logprobs---via either a transfer or prefilling attack with a *100\% success rate*. In addition, we show how to use random search on a restricted set of tokens for finding trojan strings in poisoned models---a task that shares many similarities with jailbreaking---which is the algorithm that brought us the *first place* in a recent trojan detection competition. The common theme behind these attacks is that *adaptivity* is crucial: different models are vulnerable to different prompting templates (e.g., R2D2 is very sensitive to in-context learning prompts), some models have unique vulnerabilities based on their APIs (e.g., prefilling for Claude), and in some settings, it is crucial to restrict the token search space based on prior knowledge (e.g., for trojan detection). For reproducibility purposes, we provide the code, logs, and jailbreak artifacts in the JailbreakBench format at https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-adaptive-attacks."
Poster,Jamba: Hybrid Transformer-Mamba Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30115,"Barak Lenz, Opher Lieber, Alan Arazi, Amir Bergman, Avshalom Manevich, Barak Peleg, Ben Aviram, Chen Almagor, Clara Fridman, Dan Padnos, Daniel Gissin, Daniel Jannai, Dor Muhlgay, Dor Zimberg, Edden Gerber, Elad Dolev, Eran Krakovsky, Erez Sa, Erez Schwartz, Gal Cohen, Gal Shachaf, Haim Rozenblum, Hofit Bata, Ido Blass, Inbal Magar, Itay Dalmedigos, Jhonathan Osin, Julie Fadlon, Maria Rozman, Matan Danos, Michael Gokhman, Mor Zusman, Naama Gidron, Nir Ratner, Noam Gat, Noam Rozen, Oded Fried, Ohad Leshno, Omer Antverg, Omri Abend, Or Dagan, Orit Cohavi, Raz Alon, Ro&#x27;i Belson, Roi Cohen, Rom Gilad, Roman Glozman, Shahar Lev, Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Shaked Meirom, Tal Delbari, Tal Ness, Tomer Asida, Tom Ben Gal, Tom Braude, Uriya Pumerantz, Joshua Cohen, Yonatan Belinkov, Yuval Globerson, Yuval Levy, Yoav Shoham","We present Jamba, a novel hybrid Transformer-Mamba mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. Jamba interleaves blocks of Transformer and Mamba layers, enjoying the benefits of both model families. MoE is added in some of these layers to increase model capacity while keeping active parameter usage manageable. This flexible architecture allows resource- and objective-specific configurations. We implement two configurations: Jamba-1.5-Large, with 94B active parameters, and Jamba-1.5-mini, with 12B active parameters. Built at large scale, Jamba models provide high throughput and small memory footprint compared to vanilla Transformers, especially at long-context tasks, with an effective context length of 256K tokens, the largest amongst open-weight models. At the same time, they are also competitive on standard language modeling and chatbot benchmarks. We study various architectural decisions, such as how to combine Transformer and Mamba layers, and how to mix experts, and show that some of them are crucial in large scale modeling. To support cost-effective inference, we introduce ExpertsInt8, a novel quantization technique that allows fitting Jamba-1.5-Large on a machine with 8 80GB GPUs when processing 256K-token contexts without loss of quality. We also describe several interesting properties of this architecture that the training and evaluation of Jamba have revealed. The model weights are publicly available."
Poster,JetFormer: An autoregressive generative model of raw images and text,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28106,"Michael Tschannen, André Susano Pinto, Alexander Kolesnikov","Removing modeling constraints and unifying architectures across domains has been a key driver of the recent progress in training large multimodal models. However, most of these models still rely on many separately trained components such as modality-specific encoders and decoders. In this work, we further streamline joint generative modeling of images and text. We propose an autoregressive decoder-only transformer---JetFormer---which is trained to directly maximize the likelihood of raw data, without relying on any separately pretrained components, and can understand and generate both text and images. Specifically, we leverage a normalizing flow model to obtain a soft-token image representation that is jointly trained with an autoregressive multimodal transformer. The normalizing flow model serves as both an image encoder for perception tasks and an image decoder for image generation tasks during inference. JetFormer achieves text-to-image generation quality competitive with recent VQVAE- and VAE-based baselines. These baselines rely on pretrained image autoencoders, which are trained with a complex mixture of losses, including perceptual ones. At the same time, JetFormer demonstrates robust image understanding capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, JetFormer is the first model that is capable of generating high-fidelity images and producing strong log-likelihood bounds."
