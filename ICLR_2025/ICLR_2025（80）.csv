Poster,Deep Networks Learn Features From Local Discontinuities in the Label Function,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30974,"Prithaj Banerjee, Harish G Ramaswamy, Mahesh Yadav, CHANDRA SHEKAR LAKSHMINARAYANAN","Deep neural networks outperform kernel machines on several datasets due to feature learning that happens during gradient descent training. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism through which feature learning happens and use a notion of features that corresponds to discontinuities in the true label function. We hypothesize that the core feature learning mechanism is label function discontinuities attracting model function discontinuities during training. To test this hypothesis, we perform experiments on classification data where the true label function is given by an oblique decision tree. This setup allows easy enumeration of label function discontinuities, while still remaining intractable for static kernel/linear methods. We then design/construct a novel deep architecture called a Deep Linearly Gated Network (DLGN), whose discontinuities in the input space can be easily enumerated.  In this setup, we provide supporting evidence demonstrating the movement of model function discontinuities towards the label function discontinuities during training. The easy enumerability of discontinuities in the DLGN also enables greater mechanistic interpretability. We demonstrate this by extracting the parameters of a high-accuracy decision tree from the parameters of a DLGN. We also show that the DLGN is competitive with ReLU networks and other tree-learning algorithms on several real-world tabular datasets."
Poster,Deep Random Features for Scalable Interpolation of Spatiotemporal Data,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29836,"Weibin Chen, Azhir Mahmood, Michel Tsamados, So Takao","The rapid growth of earth observation systems calls for a scalable approach to interpolate remote-sensing observations. These methods in principle, should acquire more information about the observed field as data grows. Gaussian processes (GPs) are candidate model choices for interpolation. However, due to their poor scalability, they usually rely on inducing points for inference, which restricts their expressivity. Moreover, commonly imposed assumptions such as stationarity prevents them from capturing complex patterns in the data. While deep GPs can overcome this issue, training and making inference with them are difficult, again requiring crude approximations via inducing points. In this work, we instead approach the problem through Bayesian deep learning, where spatiotemporal fields are represented by deep neural networks, whose layers share the inductive bias of stationary GPs on the plane/sphere via random feature expansions. This allows one to (1) capture high frequency patterns in the data, and (2) use mini-batched gradient descent for large scale training. We experiment on various remote sensing data at local/global scales, showing that our approach produce competitive or superior results to existing methods, with well-calibrated uncertainties."
Poster,DeepRTL: Bridging Verilog Understanding and Generation with a Unified Representation Model,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31123,"Yi Liu, Changran Xu, Yunhao Zhou, Zeju Li, Qiang Xu","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for automating hardware description language (HDL) code generation from high-level natural language instructions. While fine-tuning has improved LLMs' performance in hardware design tasks, prior efforts have largely focused on Verilog generation, overlooking the equally critical task of Verilog understanding. Furthermore, existing models suffer from weak alignment between natural language descriptions and Verilog code, hindering the generation of high-quality, synthesizable designs. To address these issues, we present DeepRTL, a unified representation model that excels in both Verilog understanding and generation. Based on CodeT5+, DeepRTL is fine-tuned on a comprehensive dataset that aligns Verilog code with rich, multi-level natural language descriptions. We also introduce the first benchmark for Verilog understanding and take the initiative to apply embedding similarity and GPT Score to evaluate the models' understanding capabilities. These metrics capture semantic similarity more accurately than traditional methods like BLEU and ROUGE, which are limited to surface-level n-gram overlaps. By adapting curriculum learning to train DeepRTL, we enable it to significantly outperform GPT-4 in Verilog understanding tasks, while achieving performance on par with OpenAI's o1-preview model in Verilog generation tasks."
Poster,DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5: Harnessing Proof Assistant Feedback for Reinforcement Learning and Monte-Carlo Tree Search,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30193,"Huajian Xin, Z.Z. Ren, Junxiao Song, Zhihong Shao, Wanjia Zhao, Haocheng Wang, Bo Liu, Liyue Zhang, Xuan Lu, Qiushi Du, Wenjun Gao, Haowei Zhang, Qihao Zhu, Dejian Yang, Zhibin Gou, Z.F. Wu, Fuli Luo, Chong Ruan","Lean is an advanced proof assistant designed to facilitate formal theorem proving by providing a variety of interactive feedback. In this paper, we explore methodologies to leverage proof assistant feedback to augment the capabilities of large language models in constructing formal proofs. First, we deploy online reinforcement learning using Lean verification outcomes as the reward signal to improve the proof completion policy. This straightforward approach shows great promise in enhancing the model's alignment with the formal verification system. In addition, we propose RMaxTS, a variant of Monte-Carlo tree search that employs an intrinsic-reward-driven exploration strategy to generate diverse proof paths. The tree structure is organized to represent the transitions of intermediate tactic states, extracted from the compilation messages given by Lean's tactic mode. The intrinsic reward is constructed to incentivize the discovery of novel tactic states, which helps to to mitigate the sparse-reward problem inherent in proof search. These techniques lead to a more efficient planning scheme for formal proof generation, achieving new state-of-the-art results on both miniF2F and ProofNet benchmarks."
Poster,Deep Signature: Characterization of Large-Scale Molecular Dynamics,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27774,"Tiexin Qin, Mengxu ZHU, Chunyang Li, Terry Lyons, Hong Yan, Haoliang Li","Understanding protein dynamics are essential for deciphering protein functional mechanisms and developing molecular therapies. However, the complex high-dimensional dynamics and interatomic interactions of biological processes pose significant challenge for existing computational techniques. In this paper, we approach this problem for the first time by introducing Deep Signature, a novel computationally tractable framework that characterizes complex dynamics and interatomic interactions based on their evolving trajectories. Specifically, our approach incorporates soft spectral clustering that locally aggregates cooperative dynamics to reduce the size of the system, as well as signature transform that collects iterated integrals to provide a global characterization of the non-smooth interactive dynamics. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that Deep Signature exhibits several desirable properties, including invariance to translation, near invariance to rotation, equivariance to permutation of atomic coordinates, and invariance under time reparameterization. Furthermore, experimental results on three benchmarks of biological processes verify that our approach can achieve superior performance compared to baseline methods."
Poster,DeepTAGE: Deep Temporal-Aligned Gradient Enhancement for Optimizing Spiking Neural Networks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28961,"Wei Liu, Li Yang, Mingxuan Zhao, Shuxun Wang, Jin Gao, Wenjuan Li, Bing Li, Weiming Hu","Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their biologically inspired spatio-temporal dynamics and spike-driven processing, are emerging as a promising low-power alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, the complex neuronal dynamics and non-differentiable spike communication mechanisms in SNNs present substantial challenges for efficient training. By analyzing the membrane potentials in spiking neurons, we found that their distributions can increasingly deviate from the firing threshold as time progresses, which tends to cause diminished backpropagation gradients and unbalanced optimization. To address these challenges, we propose Deep Temporal-Aligned Gradient Enhancement (DeepTAGE), a novel approach that improves optimization gradients in SNNs from both internal surrogate gradient functions and external supervision methods. Our DeepTAGE dynamically adjusts surrogate gradients in accordance with the membrane potential distribution across different time steps, enhancing their respective gradients in a temporal-aligned manner that promotes balanced training. Moreover, to mitigate issues of gradient vanishing or deviating during backpropagation, DeepTAGE incorporates deep supervision at both spatial (network stages) and temporal (time steps) levels to ensure more effective and robust network optimization. Importantly, our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing SNN architectures without imposing additional inference costs or requiring extra control modules. We validate the efficacy of DeepTAGE through extensive experiments on static benchmarks (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-1k) and a neuromorphic dataset (DVS-CIFAR10), demonstrating significant performance improvements."
Poster,Deep Weight Factorization: Sparse Learning Through the Lens of Artificial Symmetries,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27917,"Chris Kolb, Tobias Weber, Bernd Bischl, David Rügamer","Sparse regularization techniques are well-established in machine learning, yet their application in neural networks remains challenging due to the non-differentiability of penalties like the $L_1$ norm, which is incompatible with stochastic gradient descent. A promising alternative is shallow weight factorization, where weights are decomposed into two factors, allowing for smooth optimization of $L_1$-penalized neural networks by adding differentiable $L_2$ regularization to the factors. In this work, we introduce deep weight factorization, extending previous shallow approaches to more than two factors. We theoretically establish equivalence of our deep factorization with non-convex sparse regularization and analyze its impact on training dynamics and optimization. Due to the limitations posed by standard training practices, we propose a tailored initialization scheme and identify important learning rate requirements necessary for training factorized networks.We demonstrate the effectiveness of our deep weight factorization through experiments on various architectures and datasets, consistently outperforming its shallow counterpart and widely used pruning methods."
Poster,DeFT: Decoding with Flash Tree-attention for Efficient Tree-structured LLM Inference,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31131,"Jinwei Yao, Kaiqi Chen, Kexun Zhang, Jiaxuan You, Binhang Yuan, Zeke Wang, Tao Lin","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for complex tasks that process multiple generation calls in a tree structure with shared prefixes of tokens, including few-shot prompting, multi-step reasoning, speculative decoding, etc. However, existing inference systems for tree-based applications are inefficient due to improper partitioning of queries and KV cache during attention calculation.This leads to two main issues: (1) a lack of memory access (IO) reuse for KV cache of shared prefixes, and (2) poor load balancing.As a result, there is redundant KV cache IO between GPU global memory and shared memory, along with low GPU utilization. To address these challenges, we propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient attention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions. DeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention calculation through **KV-Guided Grouping**, a method that avoids repeatedly loading KV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation. Additionally, we propose **Flattened Tree KV Splitting**, a mechanism that ensures even distribution of the KV cache across partitions with little computation redundancy, enhancing GPU utilization during attention computations. By reducing 73-99% KV cache IO and nearly 100% IO for partial results during attention calculation, DeFT achieves up to 2.23/3.59$\times$ speedup in the end-to-end/attention latency across three practical tree-based workloads compared to state-of-the-art attention algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/LINs-lab/DeFT."
Poster,DELIFT: Data Efficient Language model Instruction Fine-Tuning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30319,"Ishika Agarwal, Krishnateja Killamsetty, Lucian Popa, Marina Danilevsky","Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is crucial for task specialization but often becomes resource-intensive due to redundant or uninformative data. Existing data selection methods typically rely either on computationally expensive gradient-based metrics or static embeddings that fail to adapt dynamically to the model’s evolving state, thus limiting their practical effectiveness. To address this,we propose DELIFT (Data Efficient Language model Instruction Fine-Tuning), leveraging a novel, computationally efficient utility metric inspired by In-Context Learning (ICL). Our ICL-based metric measures the informational value of each data sample by quantifying its effectiveness as an in-context example in improving model predictions for other samples, reflecting its actual contribution relative to the model’s current state. Integrated with tailored submodular optimization methods, DELIFT systematically selects diverse, informative subsets optimized specifically for each fine-tuning stage: instruction tuning, task-specific adaptation, and continual fine-tuning. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model scales show DELIFT reduces fine-tuning data requirements by up to 70% without compromising performance, consistently outperforming existing methods by up to 26% in effectiveness and efficiency."
Poster,DeLLMa: Decision Making Under Uncertainty with Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30624,"Ollie Liu, Deqing Fu, Dani Yogatama, Willie Neiswanger","The potential of large language models (LLMs) as decision support tools is increasingly being explored in fields such as business, engineering, and medicine, which often face challenging tasks of *decision-making under uncertainty*. In this paper, we show that directly prompting LLMs on these types of decision-making problems can yield poor results, especially as the problem complexity increases. To aid in these tasks, we propose DeLLMa (Decision-making Large Language Model assistant), a framework designed to enhance decision-making accuracy in uncertain environments. DeLLMa involves a multi-step reasoning procedure that integrates recent best practices in scaling *inference-time reasoning*, drawing upon principles from decision theory and utility theory, to provide an accurate and human-auditable decision-making process. We validate our procedure on multiple realistic decision-making environments, demonstrating that DeLLMa can consistently enhance the decision-making performance of leading language models, and achieve up to a 40% increase in accuracy over competing methods. Additionally, we show how performance improves when scaling compute at test time, and carry out human evaluations to benchmark components of DeLLMa."
