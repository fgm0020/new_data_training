Poster,Optimizing 4D Gaussians for Dynamic Scene Video from Single Landscape Images,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30162,"In-Hwan Jin, Haesoo Choo, Seong-Hun Jeong, Heemoon Park, Junghwan Kim, Oh-joon Kwon, Kyeongbo Kong","To achieve realistic immersion in landscape images, fluids such as water and clouds need to move within the image while revealing new scenes from various camera perspectives. Recently, a field called dynamic scene video has emerged, which combines single image animation with 3D photography. These methods use pseudo 3D space, implicitly represented with Layered Depth Images (LDIs). LDIs separate a single image into depth-based layers, which enables elements like water and clouds to move within the image while revealing new scenes from different camera perspectives. However, as landscapes typically consist of continuous elements, including fluids, the representation of a 3D space separates a landscape image into discrete layers, and it can lead to diminished depth perception and potential distortions depending on camera movement. Furthermore, due to its implicit modeling of 3D space, the output may be limited to videos in the 2D domain, potentially reducing their versatility. In this paper, we propose representing a complete 3D space for dynamic scene video by modeling explicit representations, specifically 4D Gaussians, from a single image. The framework is focused on optimizing 3D Gaussians by generating multi-view images from a single image and creating 3D motion to optimize 4D Gaussians. The most important part of proposed framework is consistent 3D motion estimation, which estimates common motion among multi-view images to bring the motion in 3D space closer to actual motions. As far as we know, this is the first attempt that considers animation while representing a complete 3D space from a single landscape image. Our model demonstrates the ability to provide realistic immersion in various landscape images through diverse experiments and metrics.

Poster,Optimizing Backward Policies in GFlowNets via Trajectory Likelihood Maximization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29295,"Timofei Gritsaev, Nikita Morozov, Sergey Samsonov, Daniil Tiapkin","Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a family of generative models that learn to sample objects with probabilities proportional to a given reward function. The key concept behind GFlowNets is the use of two stochastic policies: a forward policy, which incrementally constructs compositional objects, and a backward policy, which sequentially deconstructs them. Recent results show a close relationship between GFlowNet training and entropy-regularized reinforcement learning (RL) problems with a particular reward design. However, this connection applies only in the setting of a fixed backward policy, which might be a significant limitation. As a remedy to this problem, we introduce a simple backward policy optimization algorithm that involves direct maximization of the value function in an entropy-regularized Markov Decision Process (MDP) over intermediate rewards. We provide an extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed approach across various benchmarks in combination with both RL and GFlowNet algorithms and demonstrate its faster convergence and mode discovery in complex environments."
Poster,Optimizing importance weighting in the presence of sub-population shifts,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28656,"Floris Holstege, Bram Wouters, Noud Giersbergen, Cees Diks","A distribution shift between the training and test data can severely harm performance of machine learning models. Importance weighting addresses this issue by assigning different weights to data points during training. We argue that existing heuristics for determining the weights are suboptimal, as they neglect the increase of the variance of the estimated model due to the limited sample size of the training data. We interpret the optimal weights in terms of a bias-variance trade-off,  and  propose a bi-level optimization procedure in which the weights and model parameters are optimized simultaneously. We apply this framework to existing importance weighting techniques for last-layer retraining of deep neural networks in the presence of sub-population shifts and show empirically that optimizing weights significantly improves generalization performance."
Poster,Optimizing Neural Network Representations of Boolean Networks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31213,"Joshua Russell, Ignacio Gavier, Devdhar Patel, Edward Rietman, Hava Siegelmann","Neural networks are known to be universal computers for Boolean functions. Recent advancements in hardware have significantly reduced matrix multiplication times, making neural network simulation both fast and efficient. Consequently, functions defined by complex Boolean networks are increasingly viable candidates for simulation through their neural network representation. Prior research has introduced a general method for deriving neural network representations of Boolean networks. However, the resulting neural networks are often suboptimal in terms of the number of neurons and connections, leading to slower simulation performance. Optimizing them while preserving functional equivalence --lossless optimization-- is an NP-hard problem, and current methods only provide lossy solutions. In this paper, we present a deterministic algorithm to optimize such neural networks in terms of neurons and connections while preserving functional equivalence. Moreover, to accelerate the compression of the neural network, we introduce an objective-aware algorithm that exploits representations that are shared among subproblems of the overall optimization. We demonstrate experimentally that we are able to reduce connections and neurons by up to 70% and 60%, respectively, in comparison to state-of-the-art. We also find that our objective-aware algorithm results in consistent speedups in optimization time, achieving up to 34.3x and 5.9x speedup relative to naive and caching solutions, respectively. Our methods are of practical relevance to applications such as high-throughput circuit simulation and placing neurosymbolic systems on the same hardware architecture."
Poster,Optimizing Posterior Samples for Bayesian Optimization via Rootfinding,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30191,"Taiwo Adebiyi, Bach Do, Ruda Zhang","Bayesian optimization devolves the global optimization of a costly objective function to the global optimization of a sequence of acquisition functions. This inner-loop optimization can be catastrophically difficult if it involves posterior sample paths, especially in higher dimensions. We introduce an efficient global optimization strategy for posterior samples based on global rootfinding. It provides gradient-based optimizers with two sets of judiciously selected starting points, designed to combine exploration and exploitation. The number of starting points can be kept small without sacrificing optimization quality. Remarkably, even with just one point from each set, the global optimum is discovered most of the time. The algorithm scales practically linearly to high dimensions, breaking the curse of dimensionality. For Gaussian process Thompson sampling (GP-TS), we demonstrate remarkable improvement in both inner- and outer-loop optimization, surprisingly outperforming alternatives like EI and GP-UCB in most cases. Our approach also improves the performance of other posterior sample-based acquisition functions, such as variants of entropy search. Furthermore, we propose a sample-average formulation of GP-TS, which has a parameter to explicitly control exploitation and can be computed at the cost of one posterior sample."
Poster,OptionZero: Planning with Learned Options,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31084,"Po-Wei Huang, Pei-Chiun Peng, Hung Guei, Ti-Rong Wu","Planning with options -- a sequence of primitive actions -- has been shown effective in reinforcement learning within complex environments. Previous studies have focused on planning with predefined options or learned options through expert demonstration data.Inspired by MuZero, which learns superhuman heuristics without any human knowledge, we propose a novel approach, named *OptionZero*. OptionZero incorporates an *option network* into MuZero, providing autonomous discovery of options through self-play games. Furthermore, we modify the dynamics network to provide environment transitions when using options, allowing searching deeper under the same simulation constraints. Empirical experiments conducted in 26 Atari games demonstrate that OptionZero outperforms MuZero, achieving a 131.58% improvement in mean human-normalized score. Our behavior analysis shows that OptionZero not only learns options but also acquires strategic skills tailored to different game characteristics. Our findings show promising directions for discovering and using options in planning. Our code is available at https://rlg.iis.sinica.edu.tw/papers/optionzero."
Poster,Oracle efficient truncated statistics,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29220,"Konstantinos Karatapanis, Vasilis Kontonis, Christos Tzamos","We study the problem of learning from truncated samples: instead of observingsamples from some underlying population $p^\ast$, we observe only the examples that fall in some survival set $S \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ whose probability mass (measured with respect to $p^\ast$) is at least $\alpha$.  Assuming membership oracle access to the truncation set $S$, prior works obtained algorithms for the case where $p^\ast$ is Gaussian or more generally an exponential family with strongly convex likelihood --- albeit with a super-polynomial dependency on the (inverse) survival mass $1/\alpha$both in terms of runtime and in number of oracle calls to the set $S$.  In this work we design a new learning method with runtime and query complexity polynomial in $1/\alpha$.  Our result significantly improves over the prior works by focusing on efficiently solving the underlying optimization problem using a generalpurpose optimization algorithm with minimal assumptions."
Poster,Order-aware Interactive Segmentation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30760,"Bin Wang, Anwesa Choudhuri, Meng Zheng, Zhongpai Gao, Benjamin Planche, Andong Deng, Qin Liu, Terrence Chen, Ulas Bagci, Ziyan Wu","Interactive segmentation aims to accurately segment target objects with minimal user interactions. However, current methods often fail to accurately separate target objects from the background, due to a limited understanding of order, the relative depth between objects in a scene. To address this issue, we propose OIS: order-aware interactive segmentation, where we explicitly encode the relative depth between objects into order maps. We introduce a novel order-aware attention, where the order maps seamlessly guide the user interactions (in the form of clicks) to attend to the image features. We further present an object-aware attention module to incorporate a strong object-level understanding to better differentiate objects with similar order.  Our approach allows both dense and sparse integration of user clicks, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency as compared to prior works.  Experimental results demonstrate that OIS achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving mIoU after one click by 7.61 on the HQSeg44K dataset and 1.32 on the DAVIS dataset as compared to the previous state-of-the-art SegNext, while also doubling inference speed compared to current leading methods."
Poster,ORSO: Accelerating Reward Design via Online Reward Selection and Policy Optimization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31232,"Chen Bo Calvin Zhang, Zhang-Wei Hong, Aldo Pacchiano, Pulkit Agrawal","Reward shaping is critical in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly for complex tasks where sparse rewards can hinder learning. However, choosing effective shaping rewards from a set of reward functions in a computationally efficient manner remains an open challenge. We propose Online Reward Selection and Policy Optimization (ORSO), a novel approach that frames the selection of shaping reward function as an online model selection problem. ORSO automatically identifies performant shaping reward functions without human intervention with provable regret guarantees. We demonstrate ORSO's effectiveness across various continuous control tasks. Compared to prior approaches, ORSO significantly reduces the amount of data required to evaluate a shaping reward function, resulting in superior data efficiency and a significant reduction in computational time (up to 8×). ORSO consistently identifies high-quality reward functions outperforming prior methods by more than 50% and on average identifies policies as performant as the ones learned using manually engineered reward functions by domain experts."
Poster,Oryx MLLM: On-Demand Spatial-Temporal Understanding at Arbitrary Resolution,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29834,"Zuyan Liu, Yuhao Dong, Ziwei Liu, Winston Hu, Jiwen Lu, Yongming Rao","Visual data comes in various forms, ranging from small icons of just a few pixels to long videos spanning hours. Existing multi-modal LLMs usually standardize these diverse visual inputs to fixed-resolution images or patches for visual encoders and yield similar numbers of tokens for LLMs. This approach is non-optimal for multimodal understanding and inefficient for processing inputs with long and short visual contents. To solve the problem, we propose Oryx, a unified multimodal architecture for the spatial-temporal understanding of images, videos, and multi-view 3D scenes. Oryx offers an on-demand solution to seamlessly and efficiently process visual inputs with arbitrary spatial sizes and temporal lengths through two core innovations: 1) a pre-trained OryxViT model that can encode images at any resolution into LLM-friendly visual representations; 2) a dynamic compressor module that supports 1x to 16x compression on visual tokens by request. These designs enable Oryx to accommodate extremely long visual contexts, such as videos, with lower resolution and high compression while maintaining high recognition precision for tasks like document understanding with native resolution and no compression. Beyond the architectural improvements, enhanced data curation and specialized training on long-context retrieval and spatial-aware data help Oryx achieve strong capabilities in image, video, and 3D multimodal understanding simultaneously."
