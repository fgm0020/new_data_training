Poster,Transformer Learns Optimal Variable Selection in Group-Sparse Classification,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28844,"Chenyang Zhang, Xuran Meng, Yuan Cao","Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across various applications. However, the success of transformers have not been understood in theory. In this work, we give a case study of how transformers can be trained to learn a classic statistical model with ""group sparsity"", where the input variables form multiple groups, and the label only depends on the variables from one of the groups. We theoretically demonstrate that, a one-layer transformer trained by gradient descent can correctly leverage the attention mechanism to select variables, disregarding irrelevant ones and focusing on those beneficial for classification. We also demonstrate that a well-pretrained one-layer transformer can be adapted to new downstream tasks to achieve good prediction accuracy with a limited number of samples. Our study sheds light on how transformers effectively learn structured data."
Poster,Transformer Meets Twicing: Harnessing Unattended Residual Information,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31222,"Laziz Abdullaev, Tan Nguyen","Transformer-based deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across numerous language and vision tasks. While the self-attention mechanism, a core component of transformers, has proven capable of handling complex data patterns, it has been observed that the representational capacity of the attention matrix degrades significantly across transformer layers, thereby hurting its overall performance. In this work, we leverage the connection between self-attention computations and low-pass non-local means  (NLM) smoothing filters and propose the Twicing Attention, a novel attention mechanism that uses *kernel twicing procedure* in nonparametric regression to alleviate the low-pass behavior of associated NLM smoothing with compelling theoretical guarantees. This approach enables the extraction and reuse of meaningful information retained in the residuals following the imperfect smoothing operation at each layer. Our proposed method offers two key advantages over standard self-attention: 1) a provably slower decay of representational capacity and 2) improved accuracy across various data modalities and tasks. We empirically demonstrate the performance gains of our model over baseline transformers on multiple tasks and benchmarks, including image classification and language modeling, on both clean and corrupted data."
Poster,Transformers are Universal In-context Learners,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30885,"Takashi Furuya, Maarten V de Hoop, Gabriel Peyré","Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context mappings'' which enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In this work, we study in particular the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly address their expressivity, we consider the case that the mappings are conditioned on a context represented by a probability distribution of tokens which becomes discrete for a finite number of these. The relevant notion of smoothness then corresponds to continuity in terms of the Wasserstein distance between these contexts. We demonstrate that deep transformers are universal and can approximate continuous in-context mappings to arbitrary precision, uniformly over compact token domains. This result implies, as a special case, that transformers are universal approximators for continuous permutation-invariant mappings over a fixed number of tokens. It also establishes the universal approximation capability of transformers for certain in-context learning tasks, demonstrating in particular their ability to perform regression within context. A key aspect of our results, compared to existing findings, is that for a fixed precision, a single transformer can operate on an arbitrary (even infinite) number of tokens. Additionally, it operates with a fixed embedding dimension of tokens (this dimension does not increase with precision) and a fixed number of heads (proportional to the dimension). The use of MLPs between multi-head attention layers is also explicitly controlled. We consider both unmasked attentions (as used for the vision transformer) and masked causal attentions (as used for NLP and time series applications). We tackle the causal setting leveraging a space-time lifting to analyze causal attention as a mapping over probability distributions of tokens."
Poster,Transformers Can Learn Temporal Difference Methods for In-Context Reinforcement Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29736,"Jiuqi Wang, Ethan Blaser, Hadi Daneshmand, Shangtong Zhang","Traditionally, reinforcement learning (RL) agents learn to solve new tasks by updating their neural network parameters through interactions with the task environment. However, recent works demonstrate that some RL agents, after certain pretraining procedures, can learn to solve unseen new tasks without parameter updates, a phenomenon known as in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). The empirical success of ICRL is widely attributed to the hypothesis that the forward pass of the pretrained agent neural network implements an RL algorithm. In this paper, we support this hypothesis by showing, both empirically and theoretically, that when a transformer is trained for policy evaluation tasks, it can discover and learn to implement temporal difference learning in its forward pass."
Poster,Transformers Handle Endogeneity in In-Context Linear Regression,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29683,"Haodong Liang, Krishna Balasubramanian, Lifeng Lai","We explore the capability of transformers to address endogeneity in in-context linear regression. Our main finding is that transformers inherently possess a mechanism to handle endogeneity effectively using instrumental variables (IV). First, we demonstrate that the transformer architecture can emulate a gradient-based bi-level optimization procedure that converges to the widely used two-stage least squares (2SLS) solution at an exponential rate. Next, we propose an in-context pretraining scheme and provide theoretical guarantees showing that the global minimizer of the pre-training loss achieves a small excess loss. Our extensive experiments validate these theoretical findings, showing that the trained transformer provides more robust and reliable in-context predictions and coefficient estimates than the 2SLS method, in the presence of endogeneity."
Poster,Transformers Learn Low Sensitivity Functions: Investigations and Implications,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30997,"Bhavya Vasudeva, Deqing Fu, Tianyi Zhou, Elliott Kau, Youqi Huang, Vatsal Sharan","Transformers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness across many tasks, but an understanding of their inductive biases and how those biases differ from other neural network architectures remains elusive. In this work, we identify the sensitivity of the model to token-wise random perturbations in the input as a unified metric which explains the inductive bias of transformers across different data modalities and distinguishes them from other architectures. We show that transformers have lower sensitivity than MLPs,  CNNs, ConvMixers and LSTMs, across both vision and language tasks. We also show that this low-sensitivity bias has important implications: i) lower sensitivity correlates with improved robustness; it can also be used as an efficient intervention to further improve the robustness of transformers; ii) it corresponds to flatter minima in the loss landscape; and iii) it can serve as a progress measure for grokking. We support these findings with theoretical results showing (weak) spectral bias of transformers in the NTK regime, and improved robustness due to the lower sensitivity."
Poster,Transformers Learn to Implement Multi-step Gradient Descent with Chain of Thought,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28223,"Jianhao Huang, Zixuan Wang, Jason Lee","Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to significantly improve the performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly in arithmetic and reasoning tasks, by instructing the model to produce intermediate reasoning steps. Despite the remarkable empirical success of CoT and its theoretical advantages in enhancing expressivity, the mechanisms underlying CoT training remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we study the training dynamics of transformers over a CoT objective on a in-context weight prediction task for linear regression. We prove that while a one-layer linear transformer without CoT can only implement a single step of gradient descent (GD) and fails to recover the ground-truth weight vector, a transformer with CoT prompting can learn to perform multi-step GD autoregressively, achieving near-exact recovery. Furthermore, we show that the trained transformer effectively generalizes on the unseen data. Empirically, we demonstrate that CoT prompting yields substantial performance improvements."
Poster,Transformers Provably Learn Two-Mixture of Linear Classification via Gradient Flow,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30607,"Hongru Yang, Zhangyang Wang, Jason Lee, Yingbin Liang","Understanding how transformers learn and utilize hidden connections between tokens is crucial to understand the behavior of large language models.To understand this mechanism, we consider the task of two-mixture of linear classification which possesses a hidden correspondence structure among tokens, and study the training dynamics of a symmetric two-headed transformer with ReLU neurons.Motivated by the stage-wise learning phenomenon in our experiments, we design and theoretically analyze a three-stage training algorithm, which can effectively characterize the actual gradient descent dynamics when we simultaneously train the neuron weights and the softmax attention.The first stage is a neuron learning stage, where the neurons align with the underlying signals. The second stage is a attention feature learning stage, where we analyze the feature learning process of how the attention learns to utilize the relationship between the tokens to solve certain hard samples.In the meantime, the attention features evolve from a nearly non-separable state (at the initialization) to a well-separated state.The third stage is a convergence stage, where the population loss is driven towards zero.The key technique in our analysis of softmax attention is to identify a critical sub-system inside a large dynamical system and bound the growth of the non-linear sub-system by a linear system. Finally, we discuss the setting with more than two mixtures. We empirically show the difficulty of generalizing our analysis of the gradient flow dynamics to the case even when the number of mixtures equals three, although the transformer can still successfully learn such distribution. On the other hand, we show by construction that there exists a transformer that can solve mixture of linear classification given any arbitrary number of mixtures."
Poster,Transformers Provably Solve Parity Efficiently with Chain of Thought,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28433,"Juno Kim, Taiji Suzuki","This work provides the first theoretical analysis of training transformers to solve complex problems by recursively generating intermediate states, analogous to fine-tuning for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. We consider training a one-layer transformer to solve the fundamental $k$-parity problem, extending the work on RNNs by \citet{Wies23}. We establish three key results: (1) any finite-precision gradient-based algorithm, without intermediate supervision, requires substantial iterations to solve parity with finite samples. (2) In contrast, when intermediate parities are incorporated into the loss function, our model can learn parity in one gradient update when aided by \emph{teacher forcing}, where ground-truth labels of the reasoning chain are provided at each generation step. (3) Even without teacher forcing, where the model must generate CoT chains end-to-end, parity can be learned efficiently if augmented data is employed to internally verify the soundness of intermediate steps. Our findings, supported by numerical experiments, show that task decomposition and stepwise reasoning naturally arise from optimizing transformers with CoT; moreover, self-consistency checking can improve multi-step reasoning ability, aligning with empirical studies of CoT."
Poster,Transformer-Squared: Self-adaptive LLMs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28974,"Qi Sun, Edoardo Cetin, Yujin Tang","Self-adaptive large language models (LLMs) aim to solve the challenges posed by traditional fine-tuning methods, which are often computationally intensive and static in their ability to handle diverse tasks. We introduce Transformer-Squared, a novel self-adaptation framework that adapts LLMs for unseen tasks in real-time by selectively adjusting only the singular components of their weight matrices. During inference, Transformer-Squared employs a two-pass mechanism: first, a dispatch system identifies the task properties, and then task-specific 'expert' vectors, trained using reinforcement learning, are dynamically mixed to obtain targeted behavior for the incoming prompt. Our method consistently outperforms ubiquitous approaches such as LoRA, with fewer parameters and greater efficiency. Furthermore, Transformer-Squared demonstrates versatility across different LLM architectures and modalities, including vision-language tasks. Transformer-Squared represents a significant leap forward, offering a scalable, efficient solution for enhancing the adaptability and task-specific performance of LLMs, paving the way for truly dynamic, self-organizing AI systems."
