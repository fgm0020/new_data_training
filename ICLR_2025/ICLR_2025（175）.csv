Poster,Joint Fine-tuning and Conversion of Pretrained Speech and Language Models towards Linear Complexity,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30727,"Mutian He, Philip N. Garner","Architectures such as Linformer and Mamba have recently emerged as competitive linear time replacements for transformers. However, corresponding large pretrained models are often unavailable, especially in non-text domains. To remedy this, we present a Cross-Architecture Layerwise Distillation (CALD) approach that jointly converts a transformer model to a linear time substitute and fine-tunes it to a target task. We also compare several means to guide the fine-tuning to optimally retain the desired inference capability from the original model. The methods differ in their use of the target model and the trajectory of the parameters. In a series of empirical studies on language processing, language modeling, and speech processing, we show that CALD can effectively recover the result of the original model, and that the guiding strategy contributes to the result. Some reasons for the variation are suggested."
Poster,Joint Gradient Balancing for Data Ordering in Finite-Sum Multi-Objective Optimization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28185,"Hansi Yang, James Kwok","In finite-sum optimization problems, the sample orders for parameter updates can significantly influence the convergence rate of optimization algorithms. While numerous sample ordering techniques have been proposed in the context of single-objective optimization, the problem of sample ordering in finite-sum multi-objective optimization has not been thoroughly explored. To address this gap, we propose a sample ordering method called JoGBa, which finds the sample orders for multiple objectives by jointly performing online vector balancing on the gradients of all objectives. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach outperforms the standard baseline of random ordering and accelerates the convergence rate for the MGDA algorithm. Empirical evaluation across various datasets with different multi-objective optimization algorithms further demonstrates that JoGBa can achieve faster convergence and superior final performance than other data ordering strategies."
Poster,Joint Graph Rewiring and Feature Denoising via Spectral Resonance,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27686,"Jonas Linkerhägner, Cheng Shi, Ivan Dokmanić","When learning from graph data, the graph and the node features both give noisy information about the node labels. In this paper we propose an algorithm to **j**ointly **d**enoise the features and **r**ewire the graph (JDR), which improves the performance of downstream node classification graph neural nets (GNNs). JDR works by aligning the leading spectral spaces of graph and feature matrices. It approximately solves the associated non-convex optimization problem in a way that handles graphs with multiple classes and different levels of homophily or heterophily. We theoretically justify JDR in a stylized setting and show that it consistently outperforms existing rewiring methods on a wide range of synthetic and real-world node classification tasks."
Poster,Joint Reward and Policy Learning with Demonstrations and Human Feedback Improves Alignment,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29428,"Chenliang Li, Siliang Zeng, Zeyi Liao, Jiaxiang Li, Dongyeop Kang, Alfredo Garcia, Mingyi Hong","Aligning to human preferences and/or intentions is an important requirement for contemporary foundation models. To ensure alignment, popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) break down the task into three stages: (i) a model is computed with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) based upon large demonstrations data, (ii) a reward model (RM) is estimated based upon human feedback data, and (iii) reinforcement learning (RL) is used to further refine the SFT model by optimizing the estimated reward model.  Demonstrations and human feedback data reflect human user preferences in different ways. As a result, the reward model estimate obtained from only human feedback data is likely not as accurate as a reward model estimate obtained from both demonstration and human feedback data. A policy model that optimizes the reward model estimate obtained from both demonstration and human feedback data will likely exhibit better alignment performance. We introduce a tractable algorithm for finding the reward and policy models and provide a finite-time performance guarantee. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solution with extensive experiments including alignment problems in LLMs and robotic control problems in MuJoCo. We observe that the proposed solutions outperform the existing alignment algorithm by large margins, especially when the amounts of demonstration and preference data are unbalanced."
Poster,JPEG Inspired Deep Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28038,"Ahmed Hussien Salamah, Kaixiang Zheng, Yiwen Liu, EN-HUI YANG","Although it is traditionally believed that lossy image compression, such as JPEG compression, has a negative impact on the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs), it is shown by recent works that well-crafted JPEG compression can actually improve the performance of deep learning (DL). Inspired by this, we propose JPEG-DL, a novel DL framework that prepends any underlying DNN architecture with a trainable JPEG compression layer. To make the quantization operation in JPEG compression trainable, a new differentiable soft quantizer is employed at the JPEG layer, and then the quantization operation and underlying DNN are jointly trained. Extensive experiments show that in comparison with the standard DL,  JPEG-DL delivers significant accuracy improvements across various datasets and model architectures while enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks. Particularly, on some fine-grained image classification datasets, JPEG-DL can increase prediction accuracy by as much as 20.9%. Our code is available on https://github.com/AhmedHussKhalifa/JPEG-Inspired-DL.git."
Poster,JudgeBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLM-Based Judges,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30311,"Sijun Tan, Siyuan Zhuang, Kyle Montgomery, William Tang, Alejandro Cuadron, Chenguang Wang, Raluca Popa, Ion Stoica","LLM-based judges have emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation and are increasingly used to assess, compare, and improve models. However, the reliability of LLM-based judges themselves is rarely scrutinized. As LLMs become more advanced, their responses grow more sophisticated, requiring stronger judges to evaluate them. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on a judge’s alignment with human preferences, but often fail to account for more challenging tasks where crowdsourced human preference is a poor indicator of factual and logical correctness. To address this, we propose a novel evaluation framework to objectively evaluate LLM-based judges. Based on this framework, we propose JudgeBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM-based judges on challenging response pairs spanning knowledge, reasoning, math, and coding. JudgeBench leverages a novel pipeline for converting existing difficult datasets into challenging response pairs with preference labels reflecting objective correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation on a collection of prompted judges, fine-tuned judges, multi-agent judges, and reward models shows that JudgeBench poses a significantly greater challenge than previous benchmarks, with many strong models (e.g. GPT-4o) performing just slightly better than random guessing. Overall, JudgeBench offers a reliable platform for assessing increasingly advanced LLM-based judges. Data and code are available at \url{https://github.com/ScalerLab/JudgeBench}."
Poster,Judge Decoding: Faster Speculative Sampling Requires Going Beyond Model Alignment,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28440,"Gregor Bachmann, Sotiris Anagnostidis, Albert Pumarola, Markos Georgopoulos, Artsiom Sanakoyeu, Yuming Du, Edgar Schoenfeld, Ali Thabet, Jonas Kohler","The performance of large language models (LLMs) is closely linked to their underlying size, leading to ever-growing networks and hence slower inference. Speculative decoding has been proposed as a technique to accelerate autoregressive generation, leveraging a fast draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified in parallel based on their likelihood under the target model. While this approach guarantees to reproduce the target output, it incurs a substantial penalty: many high-quality draft tokens are rejected, even when they represent objectively valid continuations. Indeed, we show that even powerful draft models such as GPT-4o, as well as human text cannot achieve high acceptance rates under the standard verification scheme. This severely limits the speedup potential of current speculative decoding methods, as an early rejection becomes overwhelmingly likely when solely relying on alignment of draft and target.We thus ask the following question: Can we adapt verification to recognize correct, but non-aligned replies? To this end, we draw inspiration from the LLM-as-a-judge framework, which demonstrated that LLMs are able to rate answers in a versatile way. We carefully design a dataset coined TokenCourt to elicit the same capability in the target model by training a compact module on top of the embeddings to produce ``judgements"" of the current continuation. We showcase our strategy on the Llama-3.1 family, where our 8B/405B-Judge achieves a speedup of $9\times$ over Llama-405B, while maintaining its quality on a large range of benchmarks. These benefits remain present even in optimized inference frameworks, where our method reaches up to $141$ tokens/s for 8B/70B-Judge and $129$ tokens/s for 8B/405B on $2$ and $8$ H100s respectively."
Poster,JudgeLM: Fine-tuned Large Language Models are Scalable Judges,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27760,"Lianghui Zhu, Xinggang Wang, Xinlong Wang","Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in open-ended scenarios is challenging because existing benchmarks and metrics can not measure them comprehensively. To address this problem, we propose to fine-tune LLMs as scalable judges (JudgeLM) to evaluate LLMs efficiently and effectively in open-ended benchmarks. We first propose a comprehensive, large-scale, high-quality dataset containing task seeds, LLMs-generated answers, and GPT-4-generated judgments for fine-tuning high-performance judges, as well as a new benchmark for evaluating the judges. We train JudgeLM at different scales from 7B, 13B, to 33B parameters, and conduct a systematic analysis of its capabilities and behaviors. We then analyze the key biases in fine-tuning LLM as a judge and consider them as position bias, knowledge bias, and format bias. To address these issues, JudgeLM introduces a bag of techniques including swap augmentation, reference support, and reference drop, which clearly enhance the judge's performance. JudgeLM obtains the state-of-the-art judge performance on both the existing PandaLM benchmark and our proposed new benchmark. Our JudgeLM is efficient and the JudgeLM-7B only needs 3 minutes to judge 5K samples with 8 A100 GPUs. JudgeLM obtains high agreement with the teacher judge, achieving an agreement exceeding 90% that even surpasses human-to-human agreement. JudgeLM also demonstrates extended capabilities in being judges of the single answer, multimodal models, multiple answers, multi-turn chat, etc."
Poster,Jump Your Steps: Optimizing Sampling Schedule of Discrete Diffusion Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28310,"Yong-Hyun Park, Chieh-Hsin Lai, Satoshi Hayakawa, Yuhta Takida, Yuki Mitsufuji","Diffusion models have seen notable success in continuous domains, leading to the development of discrete diffusion models (DDMs) for discrete variables. Despite recent advances, DDMs face the challenge of slow sampling speeds. While parallel sampling methods like $\tau$-leaping accelerate this process, they introduce _Compounding Decoding Error_ (CDE), where discrepancies arise between the true distribution and the approximation from parallel token generation, leading to degraded sample quality. In this work, we present _Jump Your Steps_ (JYS), a novel approach that optimizes the allocation of discrete sampling timesteps by minimizing CDE without extra computational cost. More precisely, we derive a practical upper bound on CDE and propose an efficient algorithm for searching for the optimal sampling schedule. Extensive experiments across image, music, and text generation show that JYS significantly improves sampling quality, establishing it as a versatile framework for enhancing DDM performance for fast sampling."
Poster,Justice or Prejudice? Quantifying Biases in LLM-as-a-Judge,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31088,"Jiayi Ye, Yanbo Wang, Yue Huang, Dongping Chen, Qihui Zhang, Nuno Moniz, Tian Gao, Werner Geyer, Chao Huang, Pin-Yu Chen, Nitesh Chawla, Xiangliang Zhang","LLM-as-a-Judge has been widely utilized as an evaluation method in various benchmarks and served as supervised rewards in model training. However, despite their excellence in many domains, potential issues are under-explored, undermining their reliability and the scope of their utility. Therefore, we identify 12 key potential biases and propose a new automated bias quantification framework—CALM—which systematically quantifies and analyzes each type of bias in LLM-as-a-Judge by using automated and principle-guided modification. Our experiments cover multiple popular language models, and the results indicate that while advanced models have achieved commendable overall performance, significant biases persist in certain specific tasks. Empirical results suggest that there remains room for improvement in the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge. Moreover, we also discuss the explicit and implicit influence of these biases and give some suggestions for the reliable application of LLM-as-a-Judge. Our work highlights the need for stakeholders to address these issues and remind users to exercise caution in LLM-as-a-Judge applications."
