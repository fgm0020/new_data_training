Poster,Aligned Datasets Improve Detection of Latent Diffusion-Generated Images,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28964,"Anirudh Sundara Rajan, Utkarsh Ojha, Jedidiah Schloesser, Yong Jae Lee","As latent diffusion models (LDMs) democratize image generation capabilities, there is a growing need to detect fake images. A good detector should focus on the generative model’s fingerprints while ignoring image properties such as semantic content, resolution, file format, etc. Fake image detectors are usually built in a data-driven way, where a model is trained to separate real from fake images. Existing works primarily investigate network architecture choices and training recipes. In this work, we argue that in addition to these algorithmic choices, we also require a well-aligned dataset of real/fake images to train a robust detector. For the family of LDMs, we propose a very simple way to achieve this: we reconstruct all the real images using the LDM's autoencoder, without any denoising operation. We then train a model to separate these real images from their reconstructions. The fakes created this way are extremely similar to the real ones in almost every aspect (e.g., size, aspect ratio, semantic content), which forces the model to look for the LDM decoder's artifacts. We empirically show that this way of creating aligned real/fake datasets, which also sidesteps the computationally expensive denoising process, helps in building a detector that focuses less on spurious correlations, something that a very popular existing method is susceptible to. Finally, to demonstrate the effectivenss of dataset alignment, we build a detector using images that are not natural objects, and present promising results. Overall, our work identifies the subtle but significant issues that arise when training a fake image detector and proposes a simple and inexpensive solution to address these problems."
Poster,Aligned LLMs Are Not Aligned Browser Agents,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29856,"Priyanshu Kumar, Elaine Lau, Saranya Vijayakumar, Tu Trinh, Elaine Chang, Vaughn Robinson, Shuyan Zhou, Matt Fredrikson, Sean Hendryx, Summer Yue, Zifan Wang","For safety reasons, large language models (LLMs) are trained to refuse harmful user instructions, such as assisting dangerous activities. We study an open question in this work: does the desired safety refusal, typically enforced in chat contexts, generalize to non-chat and agentic use cases? Unlike chatbots, LLM agents equipped with general-purpose tools, such as web browsers and mobile devices, can directly influence the real world, making it even more crucial to refuse harmful instructions. In this work, we primarily focus on red-teaming browseragents – LLMs that leverage information via web browsers. To this end, we introduce Browser Agent Red teaming Toolkit (BrowserART), a comprehensive test suite designed specifically for red-teaming browser agents. BrowserART consists of 100 diverse browser-related harmful behaviors (including original behaviors and ones sourced from HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024) and AirBench 2024 (Zeng et al., 2024b)) across both synthetic and real websites. Our empirical study on state-of-the-art browser agents reveals that while the backbone LLM refuses harmful instructions as a chatbot, the corresponding agent does not. Moreover, attack methods designed to jailbreak refusal-trained LLMs in the chat settings transfer effectively to browser agents. With human rewrites, GPT-4o and o1-preview -based browser agents pursued 98 and 63 harmful behaviors (out of 100), respectively. Therefore, simply ensuring LLM’s refusal to harmful instruc-tions in chats is not sufficient to ensure that the downstream agents are safe. We publicly release BrowserART and call on LLM developers, policymakers, and agent developers to collaborate on improving agent safety."
Poster,Aligning Generative Denoising with Discriminative Objectives Unleashes Diffusion for Visual Perception,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28201,"Ziqi Pang, Xin Xu, Yu-Xiong Wang","With success in image generation, generative diffusion models are increasingly adopted for discriminative scenarios because generating pixels is a unified and natural perception interface. Although directly re-purposing their generative denoising process has established promising progress in specialist (e.g., depth estimation) and generalist models, the inherent gaps between a generative process and discriminative objectives are rarely investigated. For instance, generative models can tolerate deviations at intermediate sampling steps as long as the final distribution is reasonable, while discriminative tasks with rigorous ground truth for evaluation are sensitive to such errors. Without mitigating such gaps, diffusion for perception still struggles on tasks represented by multi-modal understanding (e.g., referring image segmentation). Motivated by these challenges, we analyze and improve the alignment between the generative diffusion process and perception objectives centering around the key observation: how perception quality evolves with the denoising process. (1) Notably, earlier denoising steps contribute more than later steps, necessitating a tailored learning objective for training: loss functions should reflect varied contributions of timesteps for each perception task. (2) Perception quality drops unexpectedly at later denoising steps, revealing the sensitiveness of perception to training-denoising distribution shift. We introduce diffusion-tailored data augmentation to simulate such drift in the training data. (3) We suggest a novel perspective to the long-standing question: why should a generative process be useful for discriminative tasks - interactivity. The denoising process can be leveraged as a controllable user interface adapting to users' correctional prompts and conducting multi-round interaction in an agentic workflow. Collectively, our insights enhance multiple generative diffusion-based perception models without architectural changes: state-of-the-art diffusion-based depth estimator, previously underplayed referring image segmentation models, and perception generalists.

Poster,Aligning Human Motion Generation with Human Perceptions,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29694,"Haoru Wang, Wentao Zhu, Luyi Miao, Yishu Xu, Feng Gao, Qi Tian, Yizhou Wang","Human motion generation is a critical task with a wide spectrum of applications. Achieving high realism in generated motions requires naturalness, smoothness, and plausibility. However, current evaluation metrics often rely on simple heuristics or distribution distances and do not align well with human perceptions. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach to bridge this gap by introducing a large-scale human perceptual evaluation dataset, MotionPercept, and a human motion critic model, MotionCritic, that capture human perceptual preferences. Our critic model offers a more accurate metric for assessing motion quality and could be readily integrated into the motion generation pipeline to enhance generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in both evaluating and improving the quality of generated human motions by aligning with human perceptions. Code and data are publicly available at https://motioncritic.github.io/."
Poster,Aligning Language Models with Demonstrated Feedback,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31183,"Omar Shaikh, Michelle Lam, Joey Hejna, Yijia Shao, Hyundong Cho, Michael Bernstein, Diyi Yang","Language models are aligned to emulate the collective voice of many, resulting in outputs that align with no one in particular. Steering LLMs away from generic output is possible through supervised finetuning or RLHF, but requires prohibitively large datasets for new ad-hoc tasks. We argue that it is instead possible to align an LLM to a specific setting by leveraging a very small number ($<10$) of demonstrations as feedback. Our method, Demonstration ITerated Task Optimization (DITTO), directly aligns language model outputs to a user's demonstrated behaviors. Derived using ideas from online imitation learning, DITTO cheaply generates online comparison data by treating users' demonstrations as preferred over output from the LLM and its intermediate checkpoints. We evaluate DITTO's ability to learn fine-grained style and task alignment across domains such as news articles, emails, and blog posts. Additionally, we conduct a user study soliciting a range of demonstrations from participants ($N=16$). Across our benchmarks and user study, we find that win-rates for DITTO outperform few-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and other self-play methods by an average of 19\% points. By using demonstrations as feedback directly, DITTO offers a novel method for effective customization of LLMs."
Poster,Aligning Visual Contrastive learning models via Preference Optimization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27829,"Amirabbas Afzali, Borna khodabandeh, Ali Rasekh, Mahyar JafariNodeh, Sepehr Ranjbar, Simon Gottschalk","Contrastive learning models have demonstrated impressive abilities to capture semantic similarities by aligning representations in the embedding space. However, their performance can be limited by the quality of the training data and its inherent biases. While Preference Optimization (PO) methods such as Reinforcement  Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have been applied to align generative models with human preferences, their use in contrastive learning has yet to be explored. This paper introduces a novel method for training contrastive learning models using different PO methods to break down complex concepts. Our method systematically aligns model behavior with desired preferences, enhancing performance on the targeted task. In particular, we focus on enhancing model robustness against typographic attacks and inductive biases, commonly seen in contrastive vision-language models like CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained using PO outperform standard contrastive learning techniques while retaining their ability to handle adversarial challenges and maintain accuracy on other downstream tasks. This makes our method well-suited for tasks requiring fairness, robustness, and alignment with specific preferences. We evaluate our method for tackling typographic attacks on images and explore its ability to disentangle gender concepts and mitigate gender bias, showcasing the versatility of our approach."
Poster,A Little Goes a Long Way: Efficient Long Context Training and Inference with Partial Contexts,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29510,"Suyu Ge, Xihui Lin, Yunan Zhang, Jiawei Han, Hao Peng","Training and serving long-context large language models (LLMs) incurs substantial overhead. To address this, two critical steps are often required: a pretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length extension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural modifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper argues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction architecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but also achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed LongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during length extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention patterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink (initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are well-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their GPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just theoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to have direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention layers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and long-context performance.(3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data is sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K.We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its effectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts, LongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%, compared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV cache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding speedup.Compared to baselines that apply KV-cache reduction techniques to full-attention long-context LLMs, LongGen achieves substantially stronger performance not only on the Needle-in-a-Haystack retrieval task, but also on more challenging long-context reasoning tasks, including BABILong and RULER."
Poster,ALLaM: Large Language Models for Arabic and English,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29915,"M Saiful Bari, Yazeed Alnumay, Norah Alzahrani, Nouf Alotaibi, Hisham Alyahya, AlRashed, Faisal Mirza, Shaykhah Alsubaie, Hassan Alahmed, Ghadah Alabduljabbar, Raghad Alkhathran, Yousef Almushayqih, Raneem Alnajim, Salman I Alsubaihi, Maryam Al Mansour, Saad Hassan, Majed Alrubaian, Ali Alammari, Zaki Alawami, Abdulmohsen Al-Thubaity, Ahmed Abdelali, Jeril Kuriakose, Abdalghani Abujabal, Nora Al-Twairesh, Areeb Alowisheq, Haidar Khan","In this work, we present ALLaM: Arabic Large Language Model, a series of large language models to support the ecosystem of Arabic Language Technologies (ALT). ALLaM is carefully trained, considering the values of language alignment and transferability of knowledge at scale. The models are based on an autoregressive decoder-only architecture and are pretrained on a mixture of Arabic and English texts. We illustrate how the second-language acquisition via vocabulary expansion can help steer a language model towards a new language without any major catastrophic forgetting in English. Furthermore, we highlight the effectiveness of using translation data and the process of knowledge encoding within the language model's latent space. Finally, we show that effective alignment with human preferences can significantly enhance the performance of a large language model (LLM) compared to less aligned models of a larger scale. Our methodology enables us to achieve state-of-the-art performance in various Arabic benchmarks, including MMLU Arabic, ACVA, and Arabic Exams. Our aligned models improve both in Arabic and English from its base aligned models."
Poster,Almost Optimal Batch-Regret Tradeoff for Batch Linear Contextual Bandits,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28187,"Zihan Zhang, Xiangyang Ji, Yuan Zhou","We study the optimal batch-regret tradeoff for batch linear contextual bandits. For this problem, we design batch learning algorithms and prove that they achieve the optimal regret bounds (up to logarithmic factors) for any batch number $M$, number of actions $K$, time horizon $T$, and dimension $d$. Therefore, we establish the \emph{full-parameter-range} (almost) optimal batch-regret tradeoff for the batch linear contextual bandit problem. Along our analysis, we also prove a new matrix concentration inequality with dependence on their dynamic upper bounds, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its kind in literature and maybe of independent interest."
Poster,AlphaEdit: Null-Space Constrained Knowledge Editing for Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30202,"Junfeng Fang, Houcheng Jiang, Kun Wang, Yunshan Ma, Jie Shi, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He, Tat-Seng Chua","Large language models (LLMs)  often exhibit hallucinations, producing incorrect or outdated knowledge. Hence, model editing methods have emerged to enable targeted knowledge updates. To achieve this, a prevailing paradigm  is the locating-then-editing approach, which first locates influential parameters and then edits them by introducing a perturbation. While effective, current studies have demonstrated that this perturbation inevitably disrupt the originally preserved knowledge within LLMs, especially in sequential editing scenarios.To address this, we introduce AlphaEdit, a novel solution that projects perturbation onto the null space of the preserved knowledge before applying it to the parameters. We theoretically prove that this projection ensures the output of post-edited LLMs remains unchanged when queried about the preserved knowledge, thereby mitigating the issue of disruption. Extensive experiments on various LLMs, including LLaMA3, GPT2-XL, and GPT-J, show that AlphaEdit boosts the performance of most locating-then-editing methods by an average of 36.7% with a single line of additional code for projection solely."
