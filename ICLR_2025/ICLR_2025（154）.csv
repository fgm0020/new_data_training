Poster,Holographic Node Representations: Pre-training Task-Agnostic Node Embeddings,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28064,"Beatrice Bevilacqua, Joshua Robinson, Jure Leskovec, Bruno Ribeiro","Large general purpose pre-trained models have revolutionized computer vision and natural language understanding. However, the development of general purpose pre-trained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) lags behind other domains due to the lack of suitable generalist node representations. Existing GNN architectures are often tailored to specific task orders, such as node-level, link-level, or higher-order tasks, because different tasks require distinct permutation symmetries, which are difficult to reconcile within a single model. In this paper, we propose _holographic node representations_, a new blueprint for node representations capable of solving tasks of any order. Holographic node representations have two key components: (1) a task-agnostic expansion map, which produces highly expressive, high-dimensional embeddings, free from node-permutation symmetries, to be fed into (2) a reduction map that carefully reintroduces the relevant permutation symmetries to produce low-dimensional, task-specific embeddings. We show that well-constructed expansion maps enable simple and efficient reduction maps, which can be adapted for any task order. Empirical results show that holographic node representations can be effectively pre-trained and reused across tasks of varying orders, yielding up to 100% relative performance improvement, including in cases where prior methods fail entirely."
Poster,Homomorphism Counts as Structural Encodings for Graph Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28259,"Linus Bao, Emily Jin, Michael Bronstein, Ismail I Ceylan, Matthias Lanzinger","Graph Transformers are popular neural networks that extend the well-known Transformer architecture to the graph domain. These architectures operate by applying self-attention on graph nodes and incorporating graph structure through the use of positional encodings (e.g., Laplacian positional encoding) or structural encodings (e.g., random-walk structural encoding). The quality of such encodings is critical, since they provide the necessary \emph{graph inductive biases} to condition the model on graph structure. In this work, we propose \emph{motif structural encoding} (MoSE) as a flexible and powerful structural encoding framework based on counting graph homomorphisms. Theoretically, we compare the expressive power of MoSE to random-walk structural encoding and relate both encodings to the expressive power of standard message passing neural networks. Empirically, we observe that MoSE outperforms other well-known positional and structural encodings across a range of architectures, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance on a widely studied molecular property prediction dataset."
Poster,Homomorphism Expressivity of Spectral Invariant Graph Neural Networks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28183,"Jingchu Gai, Yiheng Du, Bohang Zhang, Haggai Maron, Liwei Wang","Graph spectra are an important class of structural features on graphs that have shown promising results in enhancing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Despite their widespread practical use, the theoretical understanding of the power of spectral invariants --- particularly their contribution to GNNs --- remains incomplete. In this paper, we address this fundamental question through the lens of homomorphism expressivity, providing a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of the expressive power of spectral invariants. Specifically, we prove that spectral invariant GNNs can homomorphism-count exactly a class of specific tree-like graphs which we refer to as \emph{parallel trees}. We highlight the significance of this result in various contexts, including establishing a quantitative expressiveness hierarchy across different architectural variants, offering insights into the impact of GNN depth, and understanding the subgraph counting capabilities of spectral invariant GNNs. In particular, our results significantly extend \citet{arvind2024hierarchy} and settle their open questions. Finally, we generalize our analysis to higher-order GNNs and answer an open question raised by \citet{zhang2024expressive}."
Poster,HOPE for a Robust Parameterization of Long-memory State Space Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29646,"Annan Yu, Michael W Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson","State-space models (SSMs) that utilize linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems are known for their effectiveness in learning long sequences. To achieve state-of-the-art performance, an SSM often needs a specifically designed initialization, and the training of state matrices is on a logarithmic scale with a very small learning rate. To understand these choices from a unified perspective, we view SSMs through the lens of Hankel operator theory. Building upon it, we develop a new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators. Our approach helps improve the initialization and training stability, leading to a more robust parameterization. We efficiently implement these innovations by nonuniformly sampling the transfer functions of LTI systems, and they require fewer parameters compared to canonical SSMs. When benchmarked against HiPPO-initialized models such as S4 and S4D, an SSM parameterized by Hankel operators demonstrates improved performance on Long-Range Arena (LRA) tasks. Moreover, our new parameterization endows the SSM with non-decaying memory within a fixed time window, which is empirically corroborated by a sequential CIFAR-10 task with padded noise."
Poster,Horizon Generalization in Reinforcement Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30581,"Vivek Myers, Catherine Ji, Benjamin Eysenbach","We study goal-conditioned RL through the lens of generalization, but not in the traditional sense of random augmentations and domain randomization. Rather, we aim to learn goal-directed policies that generalize with respect to the horizon: after training to reach nearby goals (which are easy to learn), these policies should succeed in reaching distant goals (which are quite challenging to learn). In the same way that invariance is closely linked with generalization is other areas of machine learning (e.g., normalization layers make a network invariant to scale, and therefore generalize to inputs of varying scales), we show that this notion of horizon generalization is closely linked with invariance to planning: a policy navigating towards a goal will select the same actions as if it were navigating to a waypoint en route to that goal. Horizon generalization and invariance to planning are appealing because of their potential reach: they imply that a policy trained to reach nearby goals would succeed at reaching goals that are arbitrarily more distant.Our theoretical analysis proves that both horizon generalization and planning invariance are possible, under some assumptions. We present new experimental results, as well as recalling results from prior work, in support of our theoretical results. Taken together, our results open the door to studying how techniques for invariance and generalization developed in other areas of machine learning might be adapted to achieve this alluring property."
Poster,Hot-pluggable Federated Learning: Bridging General and Personalized FL via Dynamic Selection,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30591,"Lei Shen, Zhenheng Tang, Lijun Wu, Yonggang Zhang, Xiaowen Chu, Tao Qin, Bo Han","Personalized federated learning (PFL) achieves high performance by assuming clients only meet test data locally, which does not meet many generic federated learning (GFL) scenarios. In this work, we theoretically show that PMs can be used to enhance GFL with a new learning problem named Selective FL (SFL), which involves optimizing PFL and model selection. However, storing and selecting whole models requires impractical computation and communication costs. To practically solve SFL, inspired by model components that attempt to edit a sub-model for specific purposes, we design an efficient and effective framework named Hot-Pluggable Federated Learning (HPFL). Specifically, clients individually train personalized plug-in modules based on a shared backbone, and upload them with a plug-in marker on the server modular store. In inference stage, an accurate selection algorithm allows clients to identify and retrieve suitable plug-in modules from the modular store to enhance their generalization performance on the target data distribution. Furthermore, we provide differential privacy protection during the selection with theoretical guarantee. Our comprehensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that HPFL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GFL and PFL algorithms. Additionally, we empirically show HPFL's remarkable potential to resolve other practical FL problems such as continual federated learning and discuss its possible applications in one-shot FL, anarchic FL, and FL plug-in market. Our work is the first attempt towards improving GFL performance through a selecting mechanism with personalized plug-ins."
Poster,Hotspot-Driven Peptide Design via Multi-Fragment Autoregressive Extension,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28614,"Jiahan Li, Tong Chen, Shitong Luo, Chaoran Cheng, Jiaqi Guan, Ruihan Guo, Sheng Wang, Ge Liu, Jian Peng, Jianzhu Ma","Peptides, short chains of amino acids, interact with target proteins, making them a unique class of protein-based therapeutics for treating human diseases. Recently, deep generative models have shown great promise in peptide generation. However, several challenges remain in designing effective peptide binders. First, not all residues contribute equally to peptide-target interactions. Second, the generated peptides must adopt valid geometries due to the constraints of peptide bonds. Third, realistic tasks for peptide drug development are still lacking.To address these challenges, we introduce PepHAR, a hot-spot-driven autoregressive generative model for designing peptides targeting specific proteins. Building on the observation that certain hot spot residues have higher interaction potentials, we first use an energy-based density model to fit and sample these key residues. Next, to ensure proper peptide geometry, we autoregressively extend peptide fragments by estimating dihedral angles between residue frames. Finally, we apply an optimization process to iteratively refine fragment assembly, ensuring correct peptide structures.By combining hot spot sampling with fragment-based extension, our approach enables \textit{de novo} peptide design tailored to a target protein and allows the incorporation of key hot spot residues into peptide scaffolds. Extensive experiments, including peptide design and peptide scaffold generation, demonstrate the strong potential of PepHAR in computational peptide binder design. The source code will be available at https://github.com/Ced3-han/PepHAR."
Poster,How Discrete and Continuous Diffusion Meet: Comprehensive Analysis of Discrete Diffusion Models  via a Stochastic Integral Framework,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30876,"Yinuo Ren, Haoxuan Chen, Grant Rotskoff, Lexing Ying","Discrete diffusion models have gained increasing attention for their ability to model complex distributions with tractable sampling and inference. However, the error analysis for discrete diffusion models remains less well-understood. In this work, we propose a comprehensive framework for the error analysis of discrete diffusion models based on Lévy-type stochastic integrals. By generalizing the Poisson random measure to that with a time-independent and state-dependent intensity, we rigorously establish a stochastic integral formulation of discrete diffusion models and provide the corresponding change of measure theorems that are intriguingly analogous to Itô integrals and Girsanov's theorem for their continuous counterparts. Our framework unifies and strengthens the current theoretical results on discrete diffusion models and obtains the first error bound for the $\tau$-leaping scheme in KL divergence. With error sources clearly identified, our analysis gives new insight into the mathematical properties of discrete diffusion models and offers guidance for the design of efficient and accurate algorithms for real-world discrete diffusion model applications."
Poster,How DNNs break the Curse of Dimensionality: Compositionality and Symmetry Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29440,"Arthur Jacot, Seok Hoan Choi, Yuxiao Wen","We show that deep neural networks (DNNs) can efficiently learn anycomposition of functions with bounded $F_{1}$-norm, which allowsDNNs to break the curse of dimensionality in ways that shallow networkscannot. More specifically, we derive a generalization bound that combinesa covering number argument for compositionality, and the $F_{1}$-norm(or the related Barron norm) for large width adaptivity. We show thatthe global minimizer of the regularized loss of DNNs can fit for examplethe composition of two functions $f^{\*}=h\circ g$ from a small numberof observations, assuming $g$ is smooth/regular and reduces the dimensionality(e.g. $g$ could be the quotient map of the symmetries of $f^{*}$),so that $h$ can be learned in spite of its low regularity. The measuresof regularity we consider is the Sobolev norm with different levelsof differentiability, which is well adapted to the $F_{1}$ norm.We compute scaling laws empirically and observe phase transitionsdepending on whether $g$ or $h$ is harder to learn, as predictedby our theory."
Poster,How Does Critical Batch Size Scale in Pre-training?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30121,"Hanlin Zhang, Depen Morwani, Nikhil Vyas, Jingfeng Wu, Difan Zou, Udaya Ghai, Dean Foster, Sham Kakade","Training large-scale models under given resources requires careful design of parallelism strategies. In particular, the efficiency notion of critical batch size (CBS), concerning the compromise between time and compute, marks the threshold beyond which greater data parallelism leads to diminishing returns. To operationalize it, we propose a measure of CBS and pre-train a series of auto-regressive language models, ranging from 85 million to 1.2 billion parameters, on the C4 dataset. Through extensive hyper-parameter sweeps and careful control of factors such as batch size, momentum, and learning rate along with its scheduling, we systematically investigate the impact of scale on CBS. Then we fit scaling laws with respect to model and data sizes to decouple their effects. Overall, our results demonstrate that CBS scales primarily with data size rather than model size, a finding we justify theoretically through the analysis of infinite-width limits of neural networks and infinite-dimensional least squares regression. Of independent interest, we highlight the importance of common hyper-parameter choices and strategies for studying large-scale pre-training beyond fixed training durations."
