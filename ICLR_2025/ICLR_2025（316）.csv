Poster,Sketching for Convex and Nonconvex Regularized Least Squares with Sharp Guarantees,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30805,"Yingzhen Yang, Ping Li","Randomized algorithms play a crucial role in efficiently solving large-scale optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce Sketching for Regularized Optimization (SRO), a fast sketching algorithm designed for least squares problems with convex or nonconvex regularization. SRO operates by first creating a sketch of the original data matrix and then solving the sketched problem. We establish minimax optimal rates for sparse signal estimation by addressing the sketched sparse convex and nonconvex learning problems. Furthermore, we propose a novel Iterative SRO algorithm, which reduces the approximation error geometrically for sketched convex regularized problems. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first to provide a unified theoretical framework demonstrating minimax rates for convex and nonconvex sparse learning problems via sketching. Experimental results validate the efficiency and effectiveness of both the SRO and Iterative SRO algorithms."
Poster,Skill Expansion and Composition in Parameter Space,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30286,"Tenglong Liu, Jianxiong Li, Yinan Zheng, Haoyi Niu, Yixing Lan, Xin Xu, Xianyuan Zhan","Humans excel at reusing prior knowledge to address new challenges and developing skills while solving problems. This paradigm becomes increasingly popular in the development of autonomous agents, as it develops systems that can self-evolve in response to new challenges like human beings. However, previous methods suffer from limited training efficiency when expanding new skills and fail to fully leverage prior knowledge to facilitate new task learning. We propose Parametric Skill Expansion and Composition (PSEC), a new framework designed to iteratively evolve the agents' capabilities and efficiently address new challenges by maintaining a manageable skill library. This library can progressively integrate skill primitives as plug-and-play Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules in parameter-efficient finetuning, facilitating efficient and flexible skill expansion. This structure also enables the direct skill compositions in parameter space by merging LoRA modules that encode different skills, leveraging shared information across skills to effectively program new skills. Based on this, we propose a context-aware modular to dynamically activate different skills to collaboratively handle new tasks. Empowering diverse applications including multi-objective composition, dynamics shift, and continual policy shift, the results on D4RL, DSRL benchmarks, and the DeepMind Control Suite show that PSEC exhibits superior capacity to leverage prior knowledge to efficiently tackle new challenges, as well as expand its skill libraries to evolve the capabilities.

Poster,SleepSMC: Ubiquitous Sleep Staging via Supervised Multimodal Coordination,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30593,"Shuo Ma, Yingwei Zhang, Yiqiang Chen, Hualei Wang, Yuan Jin, Wei Zhang, Ziyu Jia","Sleep staging is critical for assessing sleep quality and tracking health. Polysomnography (PSG) provides comprehensive multimodal sleep-related information, but its complexity and impracticality limit its practical use in daily and ubiquitous monitoring. Conversely, unimodal devices offer more convenience but less accuracy. Existing multimodal learning paradigms typically assume that the data types remain consistent between the training and testing phases. This makes it challenging to leverage information from other modalities in ubiquitous scenarios (e.g., at home) where only one modality is available. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework for ubiquitous Sleep staging via Supervised Multimodal Coordination, called SleepSMC. To capture category-related consistency and complementarity across modality-level instances, we propose supervised modality-level instance contrastive coordination. Specifically, modality-level instances within the same category are considered positive pairs, while those from different categories are considered negative pairs. To explore the varying reliability of auxiliary modalities, we calculate uncertainty estimates based on the variance in confidence scores for correct predictions during multiple rounds of random masks. These uncertainty estimates are employed to assign adaptive weights to multiple auxiliary modalities during contrastive learning, ensuring that the primary modality learns from high-quality, category-related features. Experimental results on four public datasets, ISRUC-S3, MASS-SS3, Sleep-EDF-78, and ISRUC-S1, show that SleepSMC achieves state-of-the-art cross-subject performance. SleepSMC significantly improves performance when only one modality is present during testing, making it suitable for ubiquitous sleep monitoring."
Poster,SLMRec: Distilling Large Language Models into Small for Sequential Recommendation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30304,"Wujiang Xu, Qitian Wu, Zujie Liang, Jiaojiao Han, Xuying Ning, Yunxiao Shi, Wenfang Lin, Yongfeng Zhang","Sequential Recommendation (SR) task involves predicting the next item a user is likely to interact with, given their past interactions. The SR models examine the sequence of a user's actions to discern more complex behavioral patterns and temporal dynamics. Recent research demonstrates the great impact of LLMs on sequential recommendation systems, either viewing sequential recommendation as language modeling or serving as the backbone for user representation. Although these methods deliver outstanding performance, there is scant evidence of the necessity of a large language model and how large the language model is needed, especially in the sequential recommendation scene. Meanwhile, due to the huge size of LLMs, it is inefficient and impractical to apply a LLM-based model in real-world platforms that often need to process billions of traffic logs daily. In this paper, we explore the influence of LLMs' depth by conducting extensive experiments on large-scale industry datasets. Surprisingly, our motivational experiments reveal that most intermediate layers of LLMs are redundant, indicating that pruning the remaining layers can still maintain strong performance.Motivated by this insight, we empower small language models for SR, namely SLMRec, which adopt a simple yet effective knowledge distillation method. Moreover, SLMRec is orthogonal to other post-training efficiency techniques, such as quantization and pruning, so that they can be leveraged in combination. Comprehensive experimental results illustrate that the proposed SLMRec model attains the best performance using only 13\% of the parameters found in LLM-based recommendation models while simultaneously achieving up to 6.6x and 8.0x speedups in training and inference time costs, respectively. Besides, we provide a theoretical justification for why small language models can perform comparably to large language models in SR."
Poster,SLoPe: Double-Pruned Sparse Plus Lazy Low-Rank Adapter Pretraining of LLMs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28497,"Mohammad Mozaffari, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Zhao Zhang, Maryam Mehri Dehnavi","We propose SLoPe, a Double-Pruned **S**parse Plus **L**azy L**o**w-rank Adapter **P**r**e**training method for LLMs that improves the accuracy of sparse LLMs while accelerating their pretraining and inference and reducing their memory footprint. Sparse pretraining of LLMs reduces the accuracy of the model, to overcome this, prior work uses dense models during fine-tuning. SLoPe improves the accuracy of sparsely pretrained models by adding low-rank adapters in the final 1% iterations of pretraining without adding significant overheads to the model pretraining and inference. In addition, SLoPe uses a double-pruned backward pass formulation that prunes the transposed weight matrix using N:M sparsity structures to enable an accelerated sparse backward pass. SLoPe accelerates the training and inference of models with billions of parameters up to 1.25× and 1.54× respectively (OPT-33B and OPT-66B) while reducing their memory usage by up to 0.63× and 0.61× for training and inference respectively."
Poster,Slot-Guided Adaptation of Pre-trained Diffusion Models for Object-Centric Learning and Compositional Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28572,"adil kaan akan, Yucel Yemez","We present SlotAdapt, an object-centric learning method that combines slot attention with pretrained diffusion models by introducing adapters for slot-based conditioning. Our method preserves the generative power of pretrained diffusion models, while avoiding their text-centric conditioning bias. We also incorporate an additional guidance loss into our architecture to align cross-attention from adapter layers with slot attention. This enhances the alignment of our model with the objects in the input image without using external supervision. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in object discovery and image generation tasks across multiple datasets, including those with real images. Furthermore, we demonstrate through experiments that our method performs remarkably well on complex real-world images for compositional generation, in contrast to other slot-based generative methods in the literature.

Poster,SlowFast-VGen: Slow-Fast Learning for Action-Driven Long Video Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29480,"Yining Hong, Beide Liu, Maxine Wu, Yuanhao Zhai, Kai-Wei Chang, Linjie Li, Kevin Lin, Chung-Ching Lin, Jianfeng Wang, Zhengyuan Yang, Yingnian Wu, Lijuan Wang","Human beings are endowed with a complementary learning system, which bridges the slow learning of general world dynamics with fast storage of episodic memory from a new experience. Previous video generation models, however, primarily focus on slow learning by pre-training on vast amounts of data, overlooking the fast learning phase crucial for episodic memory storage. This oversight leads to inconsistencies across temporally distant frames when generating longer videos, as these frames fall beyond the model's context window. To this end, we introduce SlowFast-VGen, a novel dual-speed learning system for action-driven long video generation. Our approach incorporates a masked conditional video diffusion model for the slow learning of world dynamics, alongside an inference-time fast learning strategy based on a temporal LoRA module. Specifically, the fast learning process updates its temporal LoRA parameters based on local inputs and outputs, thereby efficiently storing episodic memory in its parameters. We further propose a slow-fast learning loop algorithm that seamlessly integrates the inner fast learning loop into the outer slow learning loop, enabling the recall of prior multi-episode experiences for context-aware skill learning. To facilitate the slow learning of an approximate world model, we collect a large-scale dataset of 200k videos with language action annotations, covering a wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments show that SlowFast-VGen outperforms baselines across various metrics for action-driven video generation, achieving an FVD score of 514 compared to 782, and maintaining consistency in longer videos, with an average of 0.37 scene cuts versus 0.89. The slow-fast learning loop algorithm significantly enhances performances on long-horizon planning tasks as well."
Poster,"Smaller, Weaker, Yet Better: Training LLM Reasoners via Compute-Optimal Sampling",https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31080,"Hritik Bansal, Arian Hosseini, Rishabh Agarwal, Vinh Tran, Seyed Mehran Kazemi","Training on high-quality synthetic data from strong language models (LMs) is a common strategy to improve the reasoning performance of LMs. In this work, we revisit whether this strategy is compute-optimal under a fixed inference budget (e.g., FLOPs). To do so, we investigate the trade-offs between generating synthetic data using a stronger but more expensive (SE) model versus a weaker but cheaper (WC) model. We evaluate the generated data across three key metrics: coverage, diversity, and false positive rate, and show that the data from WC models may have higher coverage and diversity, but also exhibit higher false positive rates. We then finetune LMs on data from SE and WC models in different settings: knowledge distillation, self-improvement, and a novel weak-to-strong improvement setup where a weaker LM teaches reasoning to a stronger LM. Our findings reveal that models finetuned on WC-generated data consistently outperform those trained on SE-generated data across multiple benchmarks and multiple choices of WC and SE models. These results challenge the prevailing practice of relying on SE models for synthetic data generation, suggesting that WC may be the compute-optimal approach for training advanced LM reasoners."
Poster,Small Models are LLM Knowledge Triggers for Medical Tabular Prediction,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29343,"Jiahuan Yan, Jintai Chen, Chaowen Hu, Bo Zheng, Yaojun Hu, Jimeng Sun, Jian Wu","Recent development in large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated impressive domain proficiency on unstructured textual or multi-modal tasks. However, despite with intrinsic world knowledge, their application on structured tabular data prediction still lags behind, primarily due to the numerical insensitivity and modality discrepancy that brings a gap between LLM reasoning and statistical tabular learning. Unlike textual or vision data (e.g., electronic clinical notes or medical imaging data), tabular data is often presented in heterogeneous numerical values (e.g., CBC reports). This ubiquitous data format requires intensive expert annotation, and its numerical nature limits LLMs' capability to effectively transfer untapped domain expertise. In this paper, we propose SERSAL, a general self-prompting method by synergy learning with small models to enhance LLM tabular prediction in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, SERSAL utilizes the LLM's prior outcomes as original soft noisy annotations, which are dynamically leveraged to teach a better small student model. Reversely, the outcomes from the trained small model are used to teach the LLM to further refine its real capability. This process can be repeatedly applied to gradually distill refined knowledge for continuous progress. Comprehensive experiments on widely used medical domain tabular datasets show that, without access to gold labels, applying SERSAL to OpenAI GPT reasoning process attains substantial improvement compared to linguistic prompting methods, which serves as an orthogonal direction for tabular LLM, and increasing prompting bonus is observed as more powerful LLMs appear.

Poster,Small-to-Large Generalization: Training Data Influences Models Consistently Across Scale,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30845,"Alaa Khaddaj, Logan Engstrom, Aleksander Madry","Choice of training data distribution greatly influences model behavior. Yet, inlarge-scale settings, precisely characterizing *how* changes in trainingdata affects predictions is often difficult due to model training costs. Currentpractice is to instead extrapolate from scaled down, inexpensive-to-train proxymodels. However, changes in data do not influence smaller and larger modelsidentically. Therefore, understanding how choice of data affects large-scalemodels raises the question: how does training data distribution influence modelbehavior across compute scale? We find that small- and large-scale languagemodel predictions (generally) *do* highly correlate across choice oftraining data. Equipped with these findings, we characterize how proxy scaleaffects effectiveness in two downstream proxy model applications: dataattribution and dataset selection."
