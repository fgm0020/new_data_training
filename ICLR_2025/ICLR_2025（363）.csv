Poster,Understanding Model Calibration - A gentle introduction and visual exploration of calibration and the expected calibration error (ECE),https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31360,Maja Pavlovic,"To be considered reliable, a model must be calibrated so that its confidence in each decision closely reflects its true outcome. In this blogpost we'll take a look at the most commonly used definition for calibration and then dive into a frequently used evaluation measure for model calibration. We'll then cover some of the drawbacks of this measure and how these surfaced the need for additional notions of calibration, which require their own new evaluation measures. This post is not intended to be an in-depth dissection of all works on calibration, nor does it focus on how to calibrate models. Instead, it is meant to provide a gentle introduction to the different notions and their evaluation measures as well as to re-highlight some issues with a measure that is still widely used to evaluate calibration."
Poster,Understanding Optimization in Deep Learning with Central Flows,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28135,"Jeremy Cohen, Alex Damian, Ameet Talwalkar, Zico Kolter, Jason Lee","Optimization in deep learning remains poorly understood.  A key difficulty is that optimizers exhibit complex oscillatory dynamics, referred to as ""edge of stability,"" which cannot be captured by traditional optimization theory.  In this paper, we show that the path taken by an oscillatory optimizer can often be captured by a  _central flow_: a differential equation which directly models the time-averaged (i.e. smoothed) optimization trajectory. We empirically show that these central flows can predict long-term optimization trajectories for generic neural networks with a high degree of numerical accuracy.  By interpreting these flows, we are able to understand  how gradient descent makes progress even as the loss sometimes goes up; how adaptive optimizers ``adapt'' to the local loss landscape; and how adaptive optimizers implicitly seek out regions of weight space where they can take larger steps.  These insights (and others) are not apparent from the optimizers' update rules, but are revealed by the central flows.  Therefore, we believe that central flows constitute a promising tool for reasoning about optimization in deep learning."
Poster,Understanding the Generalization of In-Context Learning in Transformers: An Empirical Study,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27730,"Xingxuan Zhang, Haoran Wang, Jiansheng Li, Yuan Xue, Shikai Guan, Renzhe Xu, Hao Zou, Han Yu, Peng Cui","Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and LLaMA-3 utilize the powerful in-context learning (ICL) capability of Transformer architecture to learn on the fly from limited examples. While ICL underpins many LLM applications, its full potential remains hindered by a limited understanding of its generalization boundaries and vulnerabilities. We present a systematic investigation of transformers' generalization capability with ICL relative to training data coverage by defining a task-centric framework along three dimensions: inter-problem, intra-problem, and intra-task generalization. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, encompassing tasks such as function fitting, API calling, and translation, we find that transformers lack inter-problem generalization with ICL, but excel in intra-task and intra-problem generalization. When the training data includes a greater variety of mixed tasks, it significantly enhances the generalization ability of ICL on unseen tasks and even on known simple tasks. This guides us in designing training data to maximize the diversity of tasks covered and to combine different tasks whenever possible, rather than solely focusing on the target task for testing."
Poster,Understanding the Stability-based Generalization of Personalized Federated Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27649,"Yingqi Liu, Qinglun Li, Jie Tan, Yifan Shi, Li Shen, Xiaochun Cao","Despite great achievements in algorithm design for Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), research on the theoretical analysis of generalization is still in its early stages. Some theoretical results have investigated the generalization performance of personalized models under the problem setting and hypothesis in convex conditions, which can not reflect the real iteration performance during non-convex training. To further understand the real performance from a generalization perspective, we propose the first algorithm-dependent generalization analysis with uniform stability for the typical  PFL method, Partial Model Personalization, on smooth and non-convex objectives. Specifically, we decompose the generalization errors into aggregation errors and fine-tuning errors, then creatively establish a generalization analysis framework corresponding to the gradient estimation process of the personalized training. This framework builds up the bridge among PFL, FL and Pure Local Training for personalized aims in heterogeneous scenarios, which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of PFL from the generalization perspective. Moreover, we demonstrate the impact of trivial factors like learning steps, stepsizes and communication topologies and obtain the excess risk analysis with optimization errors for PFL. Promising experiments on CIFAR datasets also corroborate our theoretical insights. Our code can be seen in https://github.com/YingqiLiu1999/Understanding-the-Stability-based-Generalization-of-Personalized-Federated-Learning."
Poster,Understanding Virtual Nodes: Oversquashing and Node Heterogeneity,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29859,"Joshua Southern, Francesco Di Giovanni, Michael Bronstein, Johannes Lutzeyer","While message passing neural networks (MPNNs) have convincing success in a range of applications, they exhibit limitations such as the oversquashing problem and their inability to capture long-range interactions. Augmenting MPNNs with a virtual node (VN) removes the locality constraint of the layer aggregation and has been found to improve performance on a range of benchmarks. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the role of VNs and benefits thereof, through the lenses of oversquashing and sensitivity analysis. First, we characterize, precisely, how the improvement afforded by VNs on the mixing abilities of the network and hence in mitigating oversquashing, depends on the underlying topology. We then highlight that, unlike Graph-Transformers (GTs), classical instantiations of the VN are often constrained to assign uniform importance to different nodes. Consequently, we propose a variant of VN with the same computational complexity, which can have different sensitivity to nodes based on the graph structure. We show that this is an extremely effective and computationally efficient baseline for graph-level tasks."
Poster,Understanding Warmup-Stable-Decay Learning Rates: A River Valley Loss Landscape View,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28484,"Kaiyue Wen, Zhiyuan Li, Jason Wang, David Hall, Percy Liang, Tengyu Ma","Training language models currently requires pre-determining a fixed compute budget because the typical cosine learning rate schedule depends on the total number of steps. In contrast, the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) schedule uses a constant learning rate to produce a main branch of iterates that can in principle continue indefinitely without a pre-specified compute budget. Then, given any compute budget, one can branch out from the main branch at a proper time with a rapidly decaying learning rate to produce a strong model. Empirically, WSD generates an intriguing, non-traditional loss curve: the loss remains elevated during the stable phase but sharply declines during the decay phase. Towards explaining this phenomenon, we conjecture that pretraining loss exhibits a river valley landscape, which resembles a deep valley with a river at its bottom. Under this assumption, we show that during the stable phase, the iterate undergoes large oscillations due to the high learning rate, yet it progresses swiftly along the river. During the decay phase, the rapidly dropping learning rate minimizes the iterate’s oscillations, moving it closer to the river and revealing true optimization progress. Therefore, the sustained high learning rate phase and fast decaying phase are responsible for progress in the river and the mountain directions, respectively, and are both critical. Our analysis predicts phenomenons consistent with empirical observations and shows that this landscape can naturally emerge from pretraining on a simple bi-gram dataset. Inspired by the theory, we introduce WSD-S, a variant of WSD that reuses previous checkpoints’ decay phases and keeps only one main branch, where we resume from a decayed checkpoint. WSD-S empirically outperforms WSD and Cyclic-Cosine in obtaining multiple pretrained language model checkpoints across various compute budgets in a single run for parameters scaling from 0.1B to 1.2B."
Poster,Unearthing Skill-level Insights for Understanding Trade-offs of Foundation Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28591,"Mazda Moayeri, Vidhisha Balachandran, Varun Chandrasekaran, Safoora Yousefi, Thomas Fel, Soheil Feizi, Besmira Nushi, Neel Joshi, Vibhav Vineet","With models getting stronger, evaluations have grown more complex, testing multiple skills in one benchmark and even in the same instance at once. However, skill-wise performance is obscured when inspecting aggregate accuracy, under-utilizing the rich signal modern benchmarks contain. We propose an automatic approach to recover the underlying skills relevant for any evaluation instance, by way of inspecting model-generated {\em rationales}. After validating the relevance of rationale-parsed skills and inferring skills for $46$k instances over $12$ benchmarks, we observe many skills to be common across benchmarks, resulting in the curation of hundreds of \emph{skill-slices} (i.e. sets of instances testing a common skill). Inspecting accuracy over these slices yields novel insights on model trade-offs: e.g., compared to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, on average, Gemini 1.5 Pro is $18\%$ more accurate in \emph{computing molar mass}, but $19\\%$ less accurate in \emph{applying constitutional law}, despite the overall accuracies of the three models differing by a mere $0.4\\%$. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach by showing that insights derived from skill slice analysis can generalize to held-out instances: when routing each instance to the model strongest on the relevant skills, we see a $3\\%$ accuracy improvement over our $12$ dataset corpus. Our skill-slices and framework open a new avenue in model evaluation, leveraging skill-specific analyses to unlock a more granular and actionable understanding of model capabilities."
Poster,"U-Nets as Belief Propagation: Efficient Classification, Denoising, and Diffusion in Generative Hierarchical Models",https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28085,Song Mei,"U-Nets are among the most widely used architectures in computer vision, renowned for their exceptional performance in applications such as image segmentation, denoising, and diffusion modeling. However, a theoretical explanation of the U-Net architecture design has not yet been fully established. This paper introduces a novel interpretation of the U-Net architecture by studying certain generative hierarchical models, which are tree-structured graphical models extensively utilized in both language and image domains. With their encoder-decoder structure, long skip connections, and pooling and up-sampling layers, we demonstrate how U-Nets can naturally implement the belief propagation denoising algorithm in such generative hierarchical models, thereby efficiently approximating the denoising functions. This leads to an efficient sample complexity bound for learning the denoising function using U-Nets within these models. Additionally, we discuss the broader implications of these findings for diffusion models in generative hierarchical models. We also demonstrate that the conventional architecture of convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) is ideally suited for classification tasks within these models. This offers a unified view of the roles of ConvNets and U-Nets, highlighting the versatility of generative hierarchical models in modeling complex data distributions."
Poster,Unhackable Temporal Reward for Scalable Video MLLMs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30267,"En Yu, Kangheng Lin, Liang Zhao, Yana Wei, Zining Zhu, Haoran Wei, Jianjian Sun, Zheng Ge, Xiangyu Zhang, Jingyu Wang, Wenbing Tao","In the pursuit of superior video-processing MLLMs, we have encountered a perplexing paradox: the “anti-scaling law”, where more data and larger models lead to worse performance. This study unmasks the culprit: “temporal hacking”, a phenomenon where models shortcut by fixating on select frames, missing the full video narrative. In this work, we systematically establish a comprehensive theory of temporal hacking, defining it from a reinforcement learning perspective, introducing the Temporal Perplexity (TPL) score to assess this misalignment, and proposing the Unhackable Temporal Rewarding (UTR) framework to mitigate the temporal hacking. Both theoretically and empirically, TPL proves to be a reliable indicator of temporal modeling quality, correlating strongly with frame activation patterns. Extensive experiments reveal that UTR not only counters temporal hacking but significantly elevates video comprehension capabilities. This work not only advances video-AI systems but also illuminates the critical importance of aligning proxy rewards with true objectives in MLLM development."
Poster,Uni$^2$Det: Unified and Universal Framework for Prompt-Guided Multi-dataset 3D Detection,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30625,"Yubin Wang, Zhikang Zou, Xiaoqing Ye, Xiao Tan, Errui Ding, Cai Zhao","We present Uni$^2$Det, a brand new framework for unified and universal multi-dataset training on 3D detection, enabling robust performance across diverse domains and generalization to unseen domains. Due to substantial disparities in data distribution and variations in taxonomy across diverse domains, training such a detector by simply merging datasets poses a significant challenge. Motivated by this observation, we introduce multi-stage prompting modules for multi-dataset 3D detection, which leverages prompts based on the characteristics of corresponding datasets to mitigate existing differences. This elegant design facilitates seamless plug-and-play integration within various advanced 3D detection frameworks in a unified manner, while also allowing straightforward adaptation for universal applicability across datasets. Experiments are conducted across multiple dataset consolidation scenarios involving KITTI, Waymo, and nuScenes, demonstrating that our Uni$^2$Det outperforms existing methods by a large margin in multi-dataset training. Notably, results on zero-shot cross-dataset transfer validate the generalization capability of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/ThomasWangY/Uni2Det."
