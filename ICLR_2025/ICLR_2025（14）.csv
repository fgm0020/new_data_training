Poster,Adversaries With Incentives:  A Strategic Alternative to Adversarial Robustness,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29487,"Maayan Ehrenberg, Roy Ganz, Nir Rosenfeld","Adversarial training aims to defend against *adversaries*: malicious opponents whose sole aim is to harm predictive performance in any way possible. This presents a rather harsh perspective, which we assert results in unnecessarily conservative training. As an alternative, we propose to model opponents as simply pursuing their own goals—rather than working directly against the classifier. Employing tools from strategic modeling, our approach enables knowledge or beliefs regarding the opponent's possible incentives to be used as inductive bias for learning. Accordingly, our method of *strategic training* is designed to defend against all opponents within an `incentive uncertainty set'. This resorts to adversarial learning when the set is maximal, but offers potential gains when the set can be appropriately reduced. We conduct a series of experiments that show how even mild knowledge regarding the opponent's incentives can be useful, and that the degree of potential gains depends on how these incentives relate to the structure of the learning task."
Poster,AdvPaint: Protecting Images from Inpainting Manipulation via Adversarial Attention Disruption,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28482,"Joonsung Jeon, Woo Jae Kim, Suhyeon Ha, Sooel Son, Sung-eui Yoon","The outstanding capability of diffusion models in generating high-quality images poses significant threats when misused by adversaries. In particular, we assume malicious adversaries exploiting diffusion models for inpainting tasks, such as replacing a specific region with a celebrity. While existing methods for protecting images from manipulation in diffusion-based generative models have primarily focused on image-to-image and text-to-image tasks, the challenge of preventing unauthorized inpainting has been rarely addressed, often resulting in suboptimal protection performance. To mitigate inpainting abuses, we propose ADVPAINT, a novel defensive framework that generates adversarial perturbations that effectively disrupt the adversary’s inpainting tasks. ADVPAINT targets the self- and cross-attention blocks in a target diffusion inpainting model to distract semantic understanding and prompt interactions during image generation. ADVPAINT also employs a two-stage perturbation strategy, dividing the perturbation region based on an enlarged bounding box around the object, enhancing robustness across diverse masks of varying shapes and sizes. Our experimental results demonstrate that ADVPAINT’s perturbations are highly effective in disrupting the adversary’s inpainting tasks, outperforming existing methods; ADVPAINT attains over a 100-point increase in FID and substantial decreases in precision."
Poster,AdvWave: Stealthy Adversarial Jailbreak Attack against Large Audio-Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31267,"Mintong Kang, Chejian Xu, Bo Li","Recent advancements in large audio-language models (LALMs) have enabled speech-based user interactions, significantly enhancing user experience and accelerating the deployment of LALMs in real-world applications. However, ensuring the safety of LALMs is crucial to prevent risky outputs that may raise societal concerns or violate AI regulations. Despite the importance of this issue, research on jailbreaking LALMs remains limited due to their recent emergence and the additional technical challenges they present compared to attacks on DNN-based audio models. Specifically, the audio encoders in LALMs, which involve discretization operations, often lead to gradient shattering, hindering the effectiveness of attacks relying on gradient-based optimizations. The behavioral variability of LALMs further complicates the identification of effective (adversarial) optimization targets. Moreover, enforcing stealthiness constraints on adversarial audio waveforms introduces a reduced, non-convex feasible solution space, further intensifying the challenges of the optimization process. To overcome these challenges, we develop AdvWave, the first jailbreak framework against LALMs. We propose a dual-phase optimization method that addresses gradient shattering, enabling effective end-to-end gradient-based optimization. Additionally, we develop an adaptive adversarial target search algorithm that dynamically adjusts the adversarial optimization target based on the response patterns of LALMs for specific queries. To ensure that adversarial audio remains perceptually natural to human listeners, we design a classifier-guided optimization approach that generates adversarial noise resembling common urban sounds. Extensive evaluations on multiple advanced LALMs demonstrate that AdvWave outperforms baseline methods, achieving a 40\% higher average jailbreak attack success rate. Both audio stealthiness metrics and human evaluations confirm that adversarial audio generated by AdvWave is indistinguishable from natural sounds. We believe AdvWave will inspire future research aiming to enhance the safety alignment of LALMs, supporting their responsible deployment in real-world scenarios."
Poster,Affine Steerable Equivariant Layer for Canonicalization of Neural Networks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30933,"Yikang Li, Yeqing Qiu, Yuxuan Chen, Zhouchen Lin","In the field of equivariant networks, achieving affine equivariance, particularly for general group representations, has long been a challenge.In this paper, we propose the steerable EquivarLayer, a generalization of InvarLayer (Li et al., 2024), by building on the concept of equivariants beyond invariants.The steerable EquivarLayer supports affine equivariance with arbitrary input and output representations, marking the first model to incorporate steerability into networks for the affine group.To integrate it with canonicalization, a promising approach for making pre-trained models equivariant, we introduce a novel Det-Pooling module, expanding the applicability of EquivarLayer and the range of groups suitable for canonicalization.We conduct experiments on image classification tasks involving group transformations to validate the steerable EquivarLayer in the role of a canonicalization function, demonstrating its effectiveness over data augmentation."
Poster,AFlow: Automating Agentic Workflow Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27691,"Jiayi Zhang, Jinyu Xiang, Zhaoyang Yu, Fengwei Teng, XiongHui Chen, Jiaqi Chen, Mingchen Zhuge, Xin Cheng, Sirui Hong, Jinlin Wang, Bingnan Zheng, Bang Liu, Yuyu Luo, Chenglin Wu","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in solving complex tasks across diverse domains, typically by employing agentic workflows that follow detailed instructions and operational sequences. However, constructing these workflows requires significant human effort, limiting scalability and generalizability. Recent research has sought to automate the generation and optimization of these workflows, but existing methods still rely on initial manual setup and fall short of achieving fully automated and effective workflow generation. To address this challenge, we reformulate workflow optimization as a search problem over code-represented workflows, where LLM-invoking nodes are connected by edges. We introduce AFLOW, an automated framework that efficiently explores this space using Monte Carlo Tree Search, iteratively refining workflows through code modification, tree-structured experience, and execution feedback. Empirical evaluations across six benchmark datasets demonstrate AFLOW's efficacy, yielding a 5.7% average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, AFLOW enables smaller models to outperform GPT-4o on specific tasks at 4.55% of its inference cost in dollars. The code is available at https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT."
Poster,A Formal Framework for Understanding Length Generalization in Transformers,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29490,"Xinting Huang, Andy Yang, Satwik Bhattamishra, Yash Sarrof, Andreas Krebs, Hattie Zhou, Preetum Nakkiran, Michael Hahn","A major challenge for transformers is generalizing to sequences longer than those observed during training. While previous works have empirically shown that transformers can either succeed or fail at length generalization depending on the task, theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. In this work, we introduce a rigorous theoretical framework to analyze length generalization in causal transformers with learnable absolute positional encodings. In particular, we characterize those functions that are identifiable in the limit from sufficiently long inputs with absolute positional encodings under an idealized inference scheme using a norm-based regularizer. This enables us to prove the possibility of length generalization for a rich family of problems. We experimentally validate the theory as a predictor of success and failure of length generalization across a range of algorithmic and formal language tasks. Our theory not only explains a broad set of empirical observations but also opens the way to provably predicting length generalization capabilities in transformers."
Poster,A General Framework for Off-Policy Learning with Partially-Observed Reward,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28461,"Rikiya Takehi, Masahiro Asami, Kosuke Kawakami, Yuta Saito","Off-policy learning (OPL) in contextual bandits aims to learn a decision-making policy that maximizes the target rewards by using only historical interaction data collected under previously developed policies. Unfortunately, when rewards are only partially observed, the effectiveness of OPL degrades severely. Well-known examples of such partial rewards include explicit ratings in content recommendations, conversion signals on e-commerce platforms that are partial due to delay, and the issue of censoring in medical problems. One possible solution to deal with such partial rewards is to use secondary rewards, such as dwelling time, clicks, and medical indicators, which are more densely observed. However, relying solely on such secondary rewards can also lead to poor policy learning since they may not align with the target reward. Thus, this work studies a new and general problem of OPL where the goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the expected target reward by leveraging densely observed secondary rewards as supplemental data. We then propose a new method called Hybrid Policy Optimization for Partially-Observed Reward (HyPeR), which effectively uses the secondary rewards in addition to the partially observed target reward to achieve effective OPL despite the challenging scenario. We also discuss a case where we aim to optimize not only the expected target reward but also the expected secondary rewards to some extent; counter-intuitively, we will show that leveraging the two objectives is in fact advantageous also for the optimization of only the target reward. Along with statistical analysis of our proposed methods, empirical evaluations on both synthetic and real-world data show that HyPeR outperforms existing methods in various scenarios."
Poster,A General Framework for Producing Interpretable Semantic Text Embeddings,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31167,"Yiqun Sun, Qiang Huang, Yixuan Tang, Anthony Tung, Jun Yu","Semantic text embedding is essential to many tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP). While black-box models are capable of generating high-quality embeddings, their lack of interpretability limits their use in tasks that demand transparency. Recent approaches have improved interpretability by leveraging domain-expert-crafted or LLM-generated questions, but these methods rely heavily on expert input or well-prompt design, which restricts their generalizability and ability to generate discriminative questions across a wide range of tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce \algo{CQG-MBQA} (Contrastive Question Generation - Multi-task Binary Question Answering), a general framework for producing interpretable semantic text embeddings across diverse tasks. Our framework systematically generates highly discriminative, low cognitive load yes/no questions through the \algo{CQG} method and answers them efficiently with the \algo{MBQA} model, resulting in interpretable embeddings in a cost-effective manner. We validate the effectiveness and interpretability of \algo{CQG-MBQA} through extensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating that it delivers embedding quality comparable to many advanced black-box models while maintaining inherently interpretability. Additionally, \algo{CQG-MBQA} outperforms other interpretable text embedding methods across various downstream tasks. The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/dukesun99/CQG-MBQA}."
Poster,A Generalist Hanabi Agent,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28311,"Arjun V Sudhakar, Hadi Nekoei, Mathieu Reymond, Miao Liu, Janarthanan Rajendran, Sarath Chandar","Traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) systems can develop cooperative strategies through repeated interactions. However, these systems are unable to perform well on any other setting than the one they have been trained on, and struggle to successfully cooperate with unfamiliar collaborators. This is particularly visible in the Hanabi benchmark, a popular 2-to-5 player cooperative card-game which requires complex reasoning and precise assistance to other agents. Current MARL agents for Hanabi can only learn one specific game-setting (e.g., 2-player games), and play with the same algorithmic agents. This is in stark contrast to humans, who can quickly adjust their strategies to work with unfamiliar partners or situations. In this paper, we introduce Recurrent Replay Relevance Distributed DQN (R3D2), a generalist agent for Hanabi, designed to overcome these limitations. We reformulate the task using text, as language has been shown to improve transfer. We then propose a distributed MARL algorithm that copes with the resulting dynamic observation- and action-space. In doing so, our agent is the first that can play all game settings concurrently, and extend strategies learned from one setting to other ones. As a consequence, our agent also demonstrates the ability to collaborate with different algorithmic agents ---agents that are themselves unable to do so."
Poster,A Generic Framework for Conformal Fairness,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27770,"Aditya Vadlamani, Anutam Srinivasan, Pranav Maneriker, Ali Payani, srinivasan parthasarathy","Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular method for uncertainty quantification with machine learning models. While conformal prediction provides probabilistic guarantees regarding the coverage of the true label, these guarantees are agnostic to the presence of sensitive attributes within the dataset. In this work, we formalize \textit{Conformal Fairness}, a notion of fairness using conformal predictors, and provide a theoretically well-founded algorithm and associated framework to control for the gaps in coverage between different sensitive groups. Our framework leverages the exchangeability assumption (implicit to CP) rather than the typical IID assumption, allowing us to apply the notion of Conformal Fairness to data types and tasks that are not IID, such as graph data. Experiments were conducted on graph and tabular datasets to demonstrate that the algorithm can control fairness-related gaps in addition to coverage aligned with theoretical expectations."
