Poster,CL-MFAP: A Contrastive Learning-Based Multimodal Foundation Model for Molecular Property Prediction and Antibiotic Screening,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28842,"Gen Zhou, Sugitha Janarthanan, Yutong Lu, Pingzhao Hu","Due to the rise in antimicrobial resistance, identifying novel compounds with antibiotic potential is crucial for combatting this global health issue. However, traditional drug development methods are costly and inefficient. Recognizing the pressing need for more effective solutions, researchers have turned to machine learning techniques to streamline the prediction and development of novel antibiotic compounds. While foundation models have shown promise in antibiotic discovery, current mainstream efforts still fall short of fully leveraging the potential of multimodal molecular data. Recent studies suggest that contrastive learning frameworks utilizing multimodal data exhibit excellent performance in representation learning across various domains. Building upon this, we introduce CL-MFAP, an unsupervised contrastive learning (CL)-based multimodal foundation (MF) model specifically tailored for discovering small molecules with potential antibiotic properties (AP) using three types of molecular data. This model employs 1.6 million bioactive molecules with drug-like properties from the ChEMBL dataset to jointly pretrain three encoders: (1) a transformer-based encoder with rotary position embedding for processing SMILES strings; (2) another transformer-based encoder, incorporating a novel bi-level routing attention mechanism to handle molecular graph representations; and (3) a Morgan fingerprint encoder using a multilayer perceptron, to achieve the contrastive learning purpose. The CL-MFAP outperforms baseline models in antibiotic property prediction by effectively utilizing different molecular modalities and demonstrates superior domain-specific performance when fine-tuned for antibiotic-related property prediction tasks."
Poster,CLoSD: Closing the Loop between Simulation and Diffusion for multi-task character control,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28291,"Guy Tevet, Sigal Raab, Setareh Cohan, Daniele Reda, Zhengyi Luo, Xue Bin Peng, Amit Bermano, Michiel van de Panne","Motion diffusion models and Reinforcement Learning (RL) based control for physics-based simulations have complementary strengths for human motion generation. The former is capable of generating a wide variety of motions, adhering to intuitive control such as text, while the latter offers physically plausible motion and direct interaction with the environment. In this work, we present a method that combines their respective strengths. CLoSD is a text-driven RL physics-based controller, guided by diffusion generation for various tasks. Our key insight is that motion diffusion can serve as an on-the-fly universal planner for a robust RL controller. To this end, CLoSD maintains a closed-loop interaction between two modules — a Diffusion Planner (DiP), and a tracking controller. DiP is a fast-responding autoregressive diffusion model, controlled by textual prompts and target locations, and the controller is a simple and robust motion imitator that continuously receives motion plans from DiP and provides feedback from the environment. CLoSD is capable of seamlessly performing a sequence of different tasks, including navigation to a goal location, striking an object with a hand or foot as specified in a text prompt, sitting down, and getting up."
Poster,Closed-Form Merging of Parameter-Efficient Modules for Federated Continual Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29651,"Riccardo Salami, Pietro Buzzega, Matteo Mosconi, Jacopo Bonato, Luigi Sabetta, Simone Calderara","Model merging has emerged as a crucial technique in Deep Learning, enabling the integration of multiple models into a unified system while preserving performance and scalability. In this respect, the compositional properties of low-rank adaptation techniques (e.g., LoRA) have proven beneficial, as simple averaging LoRA modules yields a single model that mostly integrates the capabilities of all individual modules. Building on LoRA, we take a step further by imposing that the merged model matches the responses of all learned modules. Solving this ob-jective in closed form yields an indeterminate system with A and B as unknown variables, indicating the existence of infinitely many closed-form solutions. To address this challenge, we introduce LoRM, an alternating optimization strategy that trains one LoRA matrix at a time. This allows solving for each unknown variable individually, thus finding a unique solution. We apply our proposed methodology to Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL), ensuring alignment of model responses both between clients and across tasks. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across a range of FCIL scenarios. The code to reproduce our experiments is available at github.com/aimagelab/fed-mammoth."
Poster,CLOVER: Cross-Layer Orthogonal Vectors Pruning and Fine-Tuning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31331,"Fanxu Meng, Muhan Zhang","The absorb operation utilized in DeepSeek, which merges Query-Key and Value-Output weight matrices during inference, significantly increases parameter count and computational overhead. We observe that these absorbed matrices inherently exhibit low-rank structures. Motivated by this insight, we introduce CLOVER (Cross-Layer Orthogonal Vectors), a method that factorizes these matrices into four head-wise orthogonal matrices and two sets of singular values without any loss of information. By eliminating redundant vectors, CLOVER reduces the encoder parameters in Whisper-large-v3 by 46.42% without requiring additional training. Moreover, by freezing singular vectors and fine-tuning only singular values, CLOVER enables efficient full-rank fine-tuning. When evaluated on eight commonsense reasoning tasks with LLaMA-2 7B, CLOVER surpasses existing SoTA methods—LoRA, DoRA, HiRA, and PiSSA—by 7.6%, 5.5%, 3.8%, and 0.7%, respectively."
Poster,Co$^{\mathbf{3}}$Gesture: Towards Coherent Concurrent Co-speech 3D Gesture Generation with Interactive Diffusion,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29405,"Xingqun Qi, Yatian Wang, Hengyuan Zhang, Jiahao Pan, Wei Xue, Shanghang Zhang, Wenhan Luo, Qifeng Liu, Yike Guo","Generating gestures from human speech has gained tremendous progress in animating virtual avatars. While the existing methods enable synthesizing gestures cooperated by people self-talking, they overlook the practicality of concurrent gesture modeling with two-person interactive conversations. Moreover, the lack of high-quality datasets with concurrent co-speech gestures also limits handling this issue. To fulfill this goal, we first construct a large-scale concurrent co-speech gesture dataset that contains more than 7M frames for diverse two-person interactive posture sequences, dubbed $\textbf{GES-Inter}$. Moreover, we propose Co$^{\mathbf{3}}$Gesture, a novel framework that enables concurrent coherent co-speech gesture synthesis including two-person interactive movements. Our framework is built upon two cooperative generation branches conditioned on decomposed speaker audio. Specifically, to enhance the coordination of human postures w.r.t corresponding speaker audios while interacting with the conversational partner, we present a Temporal-Interaction Module ($\textbf{TIM}$). TIM can effectively model the temporal association representation between two speakers' gesture sequences as interaction guidance and fuse it into the concurrent gesture generation. Then, we devise a mutual attention mechanism to further boost learning dependencies of interacted concurrent motions, thereby enabling us to generate vivid and coherent gestures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on our newly collected GES-Inter dataset."
Poster,COAT: Compressing Optimizer states and Activations for Memory-Efficient FP8 Training,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29297,"Haocheng Xi, Han Cai, Ligeng Zhu, Yao Lu, Kurt Keutzer, Jianfei Chen, Song Han","FP8 training has emerged as a promising method for improving training efficiency. Existing frameworks accelerate training by applying FP8 computation to linear layers while leaving optimizer states and activations in higher precision, which fails to fully optimize memory usage. This paper introduces COAT (**C**ompressing **O**ptimizer States and **A**ctivations for FP8 **T**raining), a novel FP8 training framework designed to significantly reduce memory footprint when training large models. COAT addresses current limitations through two key innovations: (1) **Dynamic Range Expansion**, which aligns optimizer state distributions more closely with the FP8 representation range, thereby reducing quantization error, and (2) **Mixed-Granularity Activation Quantization**, which optimizes activation memory using a combination of per-tensor and per-group quantization strategies. Experiments demonstrate that COAT effectively reduces end-to-end training memory footprint by **1.54×** compared to BF16 while achieving nearly lossless performance across various tasks, such as Large Language Model pretraining and fine-tuning and Vision Language Model training. COAT also achieves a **1.43×** end-to-end training speedup compared to BF16, performing on par with or surpassing TransformerEngine's speedup. COAT enables efficient full-parameter training of large models on fewer GPUs, and facilitates doubling the batch size in distributed training settings, providing a practical solution for scaling large-scale model training. Code will be released upon publication."
Poster,Cocoon: Robust Multi-Modal Perception with Uncertainty-Aware Sensor Fusion,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30466,"Minkyoung Cho, Yulong Cao, Jiachen Sun, Qingzhao Zhang, Marco Pavone, Jeong Joon Park, Heng Yang, Zhuoqing Mao","An important paradigm in 3D object detection is the use of multiple modalities to enhance accuracy in both normal and challenging conditions, particularly for long-tail scenarios. To address this, recent studies have explored two directions of adaptive approaches: MoE-based adaptive fusion, which struggles with uncertainties arising from distinct object configurations, and late fusion for output-level adaptive fusion, which relies on separate detection pipelines and limits comprehensive understanding. In this work, we introduce Cocoon, an object- and feature-level uncertainty-aware fusion framework. The key innovation lies in uncertainty quantification for heterogeneous representations, enabling fair comparison across modalities through the introduction of a feature aligner and a learnable surrogate ground truth, termed feature impression. We also define a training objective to ensure that their relationship provides a valid metric for uncertainty quantification. Cocoon consistently outperforms existing static and adaptive methods in both normal and challenging conditions, including those with natural and artificial corruptions. Furthermore, we show the validity and efficacy of our uncertainty metric across diverse datasets."
Poster,CodeMMLU: A Multi-Task Benchmark for Assessing Code Understanding & Reasoning Capabilities of CodeLLMs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30509,"Dung Nguyen, Thang Phan, Nam Le Hai, Thong Doan, Nam Nguyen, Quang Pham, Nghi Bui","Recent advances in Code Large Language Models (CodeLLMs) have primarily focused on open-ended code generation, often overlooking the crucial aspect of code understanding & reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce CodeMMLU, a comprehensive multiple-choice benchmark designed to evaluate the depth of software and code comprehension in LLMs. CodeMMLU includes nearly 20,000 questions spanning diverse domains, including code analysis, defect detection, and software engineering principles across multiple programming languages. Unlike traditional benchmarks that emphasize code generation, CodeMMLU assesses a model’s ability to reason about programs across a wide-range of tasks such as code repair, execution reasoning, and fill-in-the-blank challenges. Our extensive evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle with CodeMMLU, highlighting significant gaps in comprehension beyond generation. By emphasizing the essential connection between code understanding and effective AI-assisted development, CodeMMLU provides a critical resource for advancing more reliable and capable coding assistants."
Poster,CodePlan: Unlocking Reasoning Potential in Large Language Models by Scaling Code-form Planning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29000,"Jiaxin Wen, Jian Guan, Hongning Wang, Wei Wu, Minlie Huang","Despite the remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) on traditional natural language processing tasks, their planning ability remains a critical bottleneck in tackling complex multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing approaches mainly rely on prompting or task-specific fine-tuning, often suffering from weak robustness and cross-task generalization. To address the limitation, we introduce CodePlan, a scalable paradigm that empowers LLMs to generate and follow code-form plans---pseudocode that outlines high-level, structured reasoning processes. By leveraging the structured and versatile nature of code, CodePlan effectively captures the rich semantics and control flows inherent to sophisticated reasoning. Importantly, CodePlan allows the automatic extraction of code-form plans from massive, wide-ranging text corpora without the need for curated, task-specific datasets. This enables it to scale up efficiently and improve reasoning capabilities across diverse scenarios. To train CodePlan, we construct a large-scale dataset of 2M examples that integrate code-form plans with standard prompt-response pairs from existing corpora. With minimal computation overhead during both training and inference, CodePlan achieves a 25.1\% relative improvement compared with directly generating responses, averaged across 13 challenging multi-step reasoning benchmarks, spanning mathematical reasoning, symbolic reasoning, instruction-following, multi-hop QA, and decision-making tasks. Further analysis reveals CodePlan's increasing performance gains on more complex reasoning tasks, as well as significant data efficiency thanks to its generalization ability."
Poster,CofCA: A STEP-WISE Counterfactual Multi-hop QA benchmark,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28269,"Jian Wu, Linyi Yang, Zhen Wang, Manabu Okumura, Yue Zhang","While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in question-answering (QA) tasks, their real reasoning abilities on multiple evidence retrieval and integration on Multi-hop QA tasks remain less explored. Firstly, LLMs sometimes generate answers that rely on internal memory rather than retrieving evidence and reasoning in the given context, which brings concerns about the evaluation quality of real reasoning abilities. Although previous counterfactual QA benchmarks can separate the internal memory of LLMs, they focus solely on final QA performance, which is insufficient for reporting LLMs' real reasoning abilities. Because LLMs are expected to engage in intricate reasoning processes that involve evidence retrieval and answering a series of sub-questions from given passages. Moreover, current factual Multi-hop QA (MHQA) benchmarks are annotated on open-source corpora such as Wikipedia, although useful for multi-step reasoning evaluation, they show limitations due to the potential data contamination in LLMs' pre-training stage. To address these issues, we introduce the Step-wise and Counterfactual benchmark (CofCA), a novel evaluation benchmark consisting of factual data and counterfactual data that reveals LLMs' real reasoning abilities on multi-step reasoning and reasoning chain evaluation. Our experimental results reveal a significant performance gap of several LLMs between Wikipedia-based factual data and counterfactual data, deeming data contamination issues in existing benchmarks. Moreover, we observe that LLMs usually bypass the correct reasoning chain, showing an inflated multi-step reasoning performance. We believe that our CofCA benchmark will enhance and facilitate the evaluations of trustworthy LLMs."
