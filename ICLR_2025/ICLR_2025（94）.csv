Poster,DOCS: Quantifying Weight Similarity for Deeper Insights into Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29315,"Zeping Min, Xinshang Wang","We introduce a novel index, the Distribution of Cosine Similarity (DOCS), for quantitatively assessing the similarity between weight matrices in Large Language Models (LLMs),  aiming to facilitate the analysis of their complex architectures. Leveraging DOCS, our analysis uncovers intriguing patterns in the latest open-source LLMs: adjacent layers frequently exhibit high weight similarity and tend to form clusters, suggesting depth-wise functional specialization. Additionally, we prove that DOCS is theoretically effective in quantifying similarity for orthogonal matrices, a crucial aspect given the prevalence of orthogonal initializations in LLMs. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of LLM architecture and behavior, offering tools with potential implications for developing more efficient and interpretable models."
Poster,Do Deep Neural Network Solutions Form a Star Domain?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29678,"Ankit Sonthalia, Alexander Rubinstein, Ehsan Abbasnejad, Seong Joon Oh","It has recently been conjectured that neural network solution sets reachable via stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are convex, considering permutation invariances. This means that a linear path can connect two independent solutions with low loss, given the weights of one of the models are appropriately permuted. However, current methods to test this theory often require very wide networks to succeed. In this work, we conjecture that more generally, the SGD solution set is a star domain that contains a star model that is linearly connected to all the other solutions via paths with low loss values, modulo permutations. We propose the Starlight algorithm that finds a star model of a given learning task. We validate our claim by showing that this star model is linearly connected with other independently found solutions. As an additional benefit of our study, we demonstrate better uncertainty estimates on Bayesian Model Averaging over the obtained star domain. Further, we demonstrate star models as potential substitutes for model ensembles."
Poster,Do Egocentric Video-Language Models Truly Understand Hand-Object Interactions?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29951,"BOSHEN XU, Ziheng Wang, Yang Du, Zhinan Song, Sipeng Zheng, Qin Jin","Egocentric video-language pretraining is a crucial step in advancing the understanding of hand-object interactions in first-person scenarios. Despite successes on existing testbeds, we find that current EgoVLMs can be easily misled by simple modifications, such as changing the verbs or nouns in interaction descriptions, with models struggling to distinguish between these changes. This raises the question: ""Do EgoVLMs truly understand hand-object interactions?'' To address this question, we introduce a benchmark called $\textbf{EgoHOIBench}$, revealing the performance limitation of current egocentric models when confronted with such challenges. We attribute this performance gap to insufficient fine-grained supervision and the greater difficulty EgoVLMs experience in recognizing verbs compared to nouns. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel asymmetric contrastive objective named $\textbf{EgoNCE++}$. For the video-to-text objective, we enhance text supervision by generating negative captions using large language models or leveraging pretrained vocabulary for HOI-related word substitutions. For the text-to-video objective, we focus on preserving an object-centric feature space that clusters video representations based on shared nouns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EgoNCE++ significantly enhances EgoHOI understanding, leading to improved performance across various EgoVLMs in tasks such as multi-instance retrieval, action recognition, and temporal understanding. Our code is available at https://github.com/xuboshen/EgoNCEpp."
Poster,Does Editing Provide Evidence for Localization?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31325,"Zihao Wang, Victor Veitch","A basic aspiration for interpretability research in large language models is to localize semantically meaningful behaviors to particular components within the LLM. There are various heuristics for finding candidate locations within the LLM. Once a candidate localization is found, it can be assessed by editing the internal representations at the corresponding localization and checking whether this induces model behavior that is consistent with the semantic interpretion of the localization. The question we address here is, how strong is the evidence provided by such edits? To assess localization, we want to assess the effect of the optimal intervention at a particular location. The key new technical tool is a way of adapting LLM alignment techniques to find such optimal localized edits. With this tool in hand, we give an example where the edit-based evidence for localization appears strong, but where localization clearly fails. Indeed, we find that optimal edits at random localizations can be as effective as aligning the full model. In aggregate, our results suggest that merely observing that localized edits induce targeted changes in behavior provides little to no evidence that these locations actually encode the target behavior."
Poster,Does Refusal Training in LLMs Generalize to the Past Tense?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29179,"Maksym Andriushchenko, Nicolas Flammarion","Refusal training is widely used to prevent LLMs from generating harmful, undesirable, or illegal outputs. We reveal a curious generalization gap in the current refusal training approaches: simply reformulating a harmful request in the past tense (e.g., *""How to make a Molotov cocktail?""* to *""How did people make a Molotov cocktail?""*) is often sufficient to jailbreak many state-of-the-art LLMs. We systematically evaluate this method on Llama-3 8B, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Gemma-2 9B, Phi-3-Mini, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4o, o1-mini, o1-preview, and R2D2 models using GPT-3.5 Turbo as a reformulation model. For example, the success rate of this simple attack on GPT-4o increases from 1\% using direct requests to 88\% using 20 past-tense reformulation attempts on harmful requests from JailbreakBench with GPT-4 as a jailbreak judge. Interestingly, we also find that reformulations in the future tense are less effective, suggesting that refusal guardrails tend to consider past historical questions more benign than hypothetical future questions. Moreover, our experiments on fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo show that defending against past reformulations is feasible when past tense examples are explicitly included in the fine-tuning data. Overall, our findings highlight that the widely used alignment techniques---such as SFT, RLHF, and adversarial training---employed to align the studied models can be brittle and do not always generalize as intended. We provide code and jailbreak artifacts at https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-past-tense."
Poster,Does Safety Training of LLMs Generalize to Semantically Related Natural Prompts?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30001,"Sravanti Addepalli, Yerram Varun, Arun Suggala, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Prateek Jain","Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be susceptible to crafted adversarial attacks or jailbreaks that lead to the generation of objectionable content despite being aligned to human preferences using safety fine-tuning methods. While the large dimensionality of input token space makes it inevitable to find *adversarial* prompts that can jailbreak these models, we aim to evaluate whether safety fine-tuned LLMs are safe against *natural* prompts which are semantically related to toxic seed prompts that elicit safe responses after alignment. We surprisingly find that popular aligned LLMs such as GPT-4 can be compromised using naive prompts that are NOT even crafted with an objective of jailbreaking the model. Furthermore, we empirically show that given a seed prompt that elicits a toxic response from an unaligned model, one can systematically generate several semantically related *natural* prompts that can jailbreak aligned LLMs. Towards this, we propose a method of *Response Guided Question Augmentation (ReG-QA)* to evaluate the generalization of safety aligned LLMs to natural prompts, that first generates several toxic answers given a seed question using an unaligned LLM (Q to A), and further leverages an LLM to generate questions that are likely to produce these answers (A to Q). We interestingly find that safety fine-tuned LLMs such as GPT-4o are vulnerable to producing natural jailbreak *questions* from unsafe content (without denial) and can thus be used for the latter (A to Q) step. We obtain attack success rates that are comparable to/ better than leading adversarial attack methods on the JailbreakBench leaderboard, while being significantly more stable against defenses such as Smooth-LLM and Synonym Substitution, which are effective against existing all attacks on the leaderboard."
Poster,Does SGD really happen in tiny subspaces?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27933,"Minhak Song, Kwangjun Ahn, Chulhee Yun","Understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks is challenging due to their high-dimensional nature and intricate loss landscapes. Recent studies have revealed that, along the training trajectory, the gradient approximately aligns with a low-rank top eigenspace of the training loss Hessian, referred to as the dominant subspace. Given this alignment, this paper explores whether neural networks can be trained within the dominant subspace, which, if feasible, could lead to more efficient training methods. Our primary observation is that when the SGD update is projected onto the dominant subspace, the training loss does not decrease further.This suggests that the observed alignment between the gradient and the dominant subspace is spurious. Surprisingly, projecting out the dominant subspace proves to be just as effective as the original update, despite removing the majority of the original update component. We observe similar behavior across practical setups, including the large learning rate regime (also known as Edge of Stability), Sharpness-Aware Minimization, momentum, and adaptive optimizers. We discuss the main causes and implications of this spurious alignment, shedding light on the dynamics of neural network training."
Poster,Does Spatial Cognition Emerge in Frontier Models?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29371,"Santhosh Kumar Ramakrishnan, Erik Wijmans, Philipp Krähenbühl, Vladlen Koltun","Not yet. We present SPACE, a benchmark that systematically evaluates spatial cognition in frontier models. Our benchmark builds on decades of research in cognitive science. It evaluates large-scale mapping abilities that are brought to bear when an organism traverses physical environments, smaller-scale reasoning about object shapes and layouts, and cognitive infrastructure such as spatial attention and memory. For many tasks, we instantiate parallel presentations via text and images, allowing us to benchmark both large language models and large multimodal models. Results suggest that contemporary frontier models fall short of the spatial intelligence of animals, performing near chance level on a number of classic tests of animal cognition."
Poster,Does Training with Synthetic Data Truly Protect Privacy?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30530,"Yunpeng Zhao, Jie Zhang","As synthetic data becomes increasingly popular in machine learning tasks, numerous methods---without formal differential privacy guarantees---use synthetic data for training. These methods often claim, either explicitly or implicitly, to protect the privacy of the original training data.In this work, we explore four different training paradigms: coreset selection, dataset distillation, data-free knowledge distillation, and synthetic data generated from diffusion models. While all these methods utilize synthetic data for training, they lead to vastly different conclusions regarding privacy preservation. We caution that empirical approaches to preserving data privacy require careful and rigorous evaluation; otherwise, they risk providing a false sense of privacy."
Poster,DoF: A Diffusion Factorization Framework for Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29825,"Chao Li, Ziwei Deng, Chenxing Lin, Wenqi Chen, Yongquan Fu, Weiquan Liu, Chenglu Wen, Cheng Wang, Siqi Shen","Diffusion models have been widely adopted in image and language generation and are now being applied to reinforcement learning. However, the application of diffusion models in offline cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) remains limited. Although existing studies explore this direction, they suffer from scalability or poor cooperation issues due to the lack of design principles for diffusion-based MARL. The Individual-Global-Max (IGM) principle is a popular design principle for cooperative MARL. By satisfying this principle, MARL algorithms achieve remarkable performance with good scalability. In this work, we extend the IGM principle to the Individual-Global-identically-Distributed (IGD) principle. This principle stipulates that the generated outcome of a multi-agent diffusion model should be identically distributed as the collective outcomes from multiple individual-agent diffusion models. We propose DoF, a diffusion factorization framework for Offline MARL. It uses noise factorization function to factorize a centralized diffusion model into multiple diffusion models. We theoretically show that the noise factorization functions satisfy the IGD principle. Furthermore, DoF uses data factorization function to model the complex relationship among data generated by multiple diffusion models. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DoF.  The source code is available at [https://github.com/xmu-rl-3dv/DoF](https://github.com/xmu-rl-3dv/DoF)."
