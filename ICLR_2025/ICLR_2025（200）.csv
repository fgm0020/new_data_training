Poster,Long-Context LLMs Meet RAG: Overcoming Challenges for Long Inputs in RAG,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28355,"Bowen Jin, Jinsung Yoon, Jiawei Han, Sercan Arik","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) empowers large language models (LLMs) to utilize external knowledge sources. The increasing capacity of LLMs to process longer input sequences opens up avenues for providing more retrieved information, to potentially enhance the quality of generated outputs.  From a long-context LLM perspective, it assumes that a larger retrieval set would contain more relevant information (higher recall), that might result in improved performance. However, our empirical findings demonstrate that for many long-context LLMs, the quality of generated output initially improves first, but then subsequently declines as the number of retrieved passages increases. This paper investigates this phenomenon, identifying the detrimental impact of retrieved ""hard negatives"" as a key contributor. To mitigate this and enhance the robustness of long-context LLM-based RAG, we propose both training-free and training-based approaches. We first showcase the effectiveness of retrieval reordering as a simple yet powerful training-free optimization. Furthermore, we explore training-based methods, specifically RAG-specific implicit LLM fine-tuning and RAG-oriented fine-tuning with intermediate reasoning, demonstrating their capacity for substantial performance gains. Finally, we conduct a systematic analysis of design choices for these training-based methods, including data distribution, retriever selection, and training context length."
Poster,LongGenBench: Benchmarking Long-Form Generation in Long Context LLMs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31092,"Yuhao Wu, Ming Shan Hee, Zhiqiang Hu, Roy Ka-Wei Lee","Current benchmarks like ``$\textit{Needle-in-a-Haystack}$'' ($\textit{NIAH}$), $\textit{Ruler}$, and $\textit{Needlebench}$ focus on models' ability to understand long-context input sequences but fail to capture a critical dimension: the generation of high-quality long-form text. Applications such as design proposals, technical documentation, and creative writing rely on coherent, instruction-following outputs over extended sequences—a challenge that existing benchmarks do not adequately address. To fill this gap, we introduce $\textit{LongGenBench}$, a novel benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate large language models' (LLMs) ability to generate long text while adhering to complex instructions. Through tasks requiring specific events or constraints within generated text, $\textit{LongGenBench}$ evaluates model performance across four distinct scenarios, three instruction types, and two generation-lengths (16K and 32K tokens). Our evaluation of ten state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that, despite strong results on $\textit{Ruler}$, all models struggled with long text generation on $\textit{LongGenBench}$, particularly as text length increased. This suggests that current LLMs are not yet equipped to meet the demands of real-world, long-form text generation. We open-source $\textit{LongGenBench}$ to promote comprehensive evaluation and improvement in this critical area, with code and data available at ${anonymousurl}$."
Poster,Long-horizon Visual Instruction Generation with Logic and Attribute Self-reflection,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30395,"Yucheng Suo, Fan Ma, Kaixin Shen, Linchao Zhu, Yi Yang","Visual instructions for long-horizon tasks are crucial as they intuitively clarify complex concepts and enhance retention across extended steps. Directly generating a series of images using text-to-image models without considering the context of previous steps results in inconsistent images, increasing cognitive load.  Additionally, the generated images often miss objects or the attributes such as color, shape, and state of the objects are inaccurate.To address these challenges, we propose LIGER, the first training-free framework for Long-horizon Instruction GEneration with logic and attribute self-Reflection. LIGER first generates a draft image for each step with the historical prompt and visual memory of previous steps. This step-by-step generation approach maintains consistency between images in long-horizon tasks. Moreover, LIGER utilizes various image editing tools to rectify errors including wrong attributes, logic errors, object redundancy, and identity inconsistency in the draft images. Through this self-reflection mechanism, LIGER improves the logic and object attribute correctness of the images.To verify whether the generated images assist human understanding, we manually curated a new benchmark consisting of various long-horizon tasks. Human-annotated ground truth expressions reflect the human-defined criteria for how an image should appear to be illustrative. Experiments demonstrate the visual instructions generated by LIGER are more comprehensive compared with baseline methods. The code and dataset will be available once accepted."
Poster,Longhorn: State Space Models are Amortized Online Learners,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30749,"Bo Liu, Rui Wang, Lemeng Wu, Yihao Feng, Peter Stone, Qiang Liu","The most fundamental capability of modern AI methods such as Large Language Models (LLMs) is the ability to predict the next token in a long sequence of tokens, known as “sequence modeling.”  Although the Transformers model is the current dominant approach to sequence modeling, its quadratic computational cost with respect to sequence length is a significant drawback. State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs.In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives.Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks."
Poster,LongMamba: Enhancing Mamba's Long-Context Capabilities via Training-Free Receptive Field Enlargement,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28881,"Zhifan Ye, Kejing Xia, Yonggan Fu, Xin Dong, Jihoon Hong, Xiangchi Yuan, Shizhe Diao, Jan Kautz, Pavlo Molchanov, Yingyan Celine Lin","State space models (SSMs) have emerged as an efficient alternative to Transformer models for language modeling, offering linear computational complexity and constant memory usage as context length increases. However, despite their efficiency in handling long contexts, recent studies have shown that SSMs, such as Mamba models, generally underperform compared to Transformers in long-context understanding tasks. To address this significant shortfall and achieve both efficient and accurate long-context understanding, we propose LongMamba, a training-free technique that significantly enhances the long-context capabilities of Mamba models. LongMamba builds on our discovery that the hidden channels in Mamba can be categorized into local and global channels based on their receptive field lengths, with global channels primarily responsible for long-context capability. These global channels can become the key bottleneck as the input context lengthens. Specifically, when input lengths largely exceed the training sequence length, global channels exhibit limitations in adaptively extend their receptive fields, leading to Mamba’s poor long-context performance. The key idea of LongMamba is to mitigate the hidden state memory decay in these global channels by preventing the accumulation of unimportant tokens in their memory. This is achieved by first identifying critical tokens in the global channels and then applying token filtering to accumulate only those critical tokens. Through extensive benchmarking across synthetic and real-world long-context scenarios, LongMamba sets a new standard for Mamba’s long-context performance, significantly extending its operational range without requiring additional training.

Poster,LongMemEval: Benchmarking Chat Assistants on Long-Term Interactive Memory,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28290,"Di Wu, Hongwei Wang, Wenhao Yu, Yuwei Zhang, Kai-Wei Chang, Dong Yu","Recent large language model (LLM)-driven chat assistant systems have integrated memory components to track user-assistant chat histories, enabling more accurate and personalized responses. However, their long-term memory capabilities in sustained interactions remain underexplored. We introduce LongMemEval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate five core long-term memory abilities of chat assistants: information extraction, multi-session reasoning, temporal reasoning, knowledge updates, and abstention. With 500 meticulously curated questions embedded within freely scalable user-assistant chat histories, LongMemEval presents a significant challenge to existing long-term memory systems, with commercial chat assistants and long-context LLMs showing a 30% accuracy drop on memorizing information across sustained interactions. We then present a unified framework that breaks down the long-term memory design into three stages: indexing, retrieval, and reading. Built upon key experimental insights, we propose several memory design optimizations including session decomposition for value granularity, fact-augmented key expansion for indexing, and time-aware query expansion for refining the search scope. Extensive experiments show that these optimizations greatly improve both memory recall and downstream question answering on LongMemEval. Overall, our study provides valuable resources and guidance for advancing the long-term memory capabilities of LLM-based chat assistants, paving the way toward more personalized and reliable conversational AI. Our benchmark and code are publicly available at https://github.com/xiaowu0162/LongMemEval."
Poster,LongPO: Long Context Self-Evolution of Large Language Models through Short-to-Long Preference Optimization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28247,"Guanzheng Chen, Xin Li, Michael Qizhe Shieh, Lidong Bing","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities through pretraining and alignment. However, superior short-context LLMs may underperform in long-context scenarios due to insufficient long-context alignment. This alignment process remains challenging due to the impracticality of human annotation for extended contexts and the difficulty in balancing short- and long-context performance. To address these challenges, we introduce LongPO, that enables short-context LLMs to self-evolve to excel on long-context tasks by internally transferring short-context capabilities. LongPO harnesses LLMs to learn from self-generated short-to-long preference data, comprising paired responses generated for identical instructions with long-context inputs and their compressed short-context counterparts, respectively. This preference reveals capabilities and potentials of LLMs cultivated during short-context alignment that may be diminished in under-aligned long-context scenarios. Additionally, LongPO incorporates a short-to-long KL constraint to mitigate short-context performance decline during long-context alignment. When applied to Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 from 128K to 512K context lengths, LongPO fully retains short-context performance and largely outperforms naive SFT and DPO in both long- and short-context tasks. Specifically, LongPO-trained models can achieve results on long-context benchmarks comparable to, or even surpassing, those of superior LLMs (e.g., GPT-4-128K) that involve extensive long-context annotation and larger parameter scales. Our code is available at https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/LongPO."
Poster,Long-Sequence Recommendation Models Need Decoupled Embeddings,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28620,"Ningya Feng, Junwei Pan, Jialong Wu, Baixu Chen, Ximei Wang, QianLi, Xian Hu, Jie Jiang, Mingsheng Long","Lifelong user behavior sequences are crucial for capturing user interests and predicting user responses in modern recommendation systems. A two-stage paradigm is typically adopted to handle these long sequences: a subset of relevant behaviors is first searched from the original long sequences via an attention mechanism in the first stage and then aggregated with the target item to construct a discriminative representation for prediction in the second stage. In this work, we identify and characterize, for the first time, a neglected deficiency in existing long-sequence recommendation models: a single set of embeddings struggles with learning both attention and representation, leading to interference between these two processes. Initial attempts to address this issue with some common methods (e.g., linear projections---a technique borrowed from language processing) proved ineffective, shedding light on the unique challenges of recommendation models. To overcome this, we propose the Decoupled Attention and Representation Embeddings (DARE) model, where two distinct embedding tables are initialized and learned separately to fully decouple attention and representation. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that DARE provides more accurate searches of correlated behaviors and outperforms baselines with AUC gains up to 9‰ on public datasets and notable improvements on Tencent's advertising platform. Furthermore, decoupling embedding spaces allows us to reduce the attention embedding dimension and accelerate the search procedure by 50\% without significant performance impact, enabling more efficient, high-performance online serving. Code in PyTorch for experiments, including model analysis, is available at https://github.com/thuml/DARE."
Poster,Long-Short Decision Transformer: Bridging Global and Local Dependencies for Generalized Decision-Making,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29888,"Jincheng Wang, Penny Karanasou, Pengyuan Wei, Elia Gatti, Diego Plasencia, Dimitrios Kanoulas","Decision Transformers (DTs) effectively capture long-range dependencies using self-attention but struggle with fine-grained local relationships, especially the Markovian properties in many offline-RL datasets. Conversely, Decision Convformer (DC) utilizes convolutional filters for capturing local patterns but shows limitations in tasks demanding long-term dependencies, such as Maze2d. To address these limitations and leverage both strengths, we propose the Long-Short Decision Transformer (LSDT), a general-purpose architecture to effectively capture global and local dependencies across two specialized parallel branches (self-attention and convolution). We explore how these branches complement each other by modeling various ranged dependencies across different environments, and compare it against other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate our LSDT achieves state-of-the-art performance and notable gains over the standard DT in D4RL offline RL benchmark. Leveraging the parallel architecture, LSDT performs consistently on diverse datasets, including Markovian and non-Markovian. We also demonstrate the flexibility of LSDT's architecture, where its specialized branches can be replaced or integrated into models like DC to improve their performance in capturing diverse dependencies. Finally, we also highlight the role of goal states in improving decision-making for goal-reaching tasks like Antmaze."
Poster,Long-tailed Adversarial Training with Self-Distillation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27919,"Seungju Cho, Hongsin Lee, Changick Kim","Adversarial training significantly enhances adversarial robustness, yet superior performance is predominantly achieved on balanced datasets. Addressing adversarial robustness in the context of unbalanced or long-tailed distributions is considerably more challenging, mainly due to the scarcity of tail data instances.  Previous research on adversarial robustness within long-tailed distributions has primarily focused on combining traditional long-tailed natural training with existing adversarial robustness methods. In this study, we provide an in-depth analysis for the challenge that adversarial training struggles to achieve high performance on tail classes in long-tailed distributions. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective solution to advance adversarial robustness on long-tailed distributions through a novel self-distillation technique. Specifically, this approach leverages a balanced self-teacher model, which is trained using a balanced dataset sampled from the original long-tailed dataset.Our extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both clean and robust accuracy for long-tailed adversarial robustness, with significant improvements in tail class performance on various datasets.We improve the accuracy against PGD attacks for tail classes by 20.3, 7.1, and 3.8 percentage points on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet, respectively, while achieving the highest robust accuracy."
