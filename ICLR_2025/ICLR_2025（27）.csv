Poster,A Statistical Approach for Controlled Training Data Detection,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29318,"Zirui Hu, Yingjie Wang, Zheng Zhang, Hong Chen, Dacheng Tao","Detecting training data for large language models (LLMs) is receiving growing attention, especially in applications requiring high reliability. While numerous efforts have been made to address this issue, they typically focus on accuracy without ensuring controllable results.To fill this gap, we propose **K**nockoff Inference-based **T**raining data **D**etector (KTD), a novel method that achieves rigorous false discovery rate (FDR) control in training data detection. Specifically, KTD generates synthetic knockoff samples that seamlessly replace original data points without compromising contextual integrity. A novel knockoff statistic, which incorporates multiple knockoff draws, is then calculated to ensure FDR control while maintaining high power. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates KTD's asymptotic optimality in terms of FDR control and power. Empirical experiments on real-world datasets such as WikiMIA, XSum and Real Time BBC News further validate KTD's superior performance compared to existing methods."
Poster,A Statistical Framework for Ranking LLM-based Chatbots,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28215,"Siavash Ameli, Siyuan Zhuang, Ion Stoica, Michael W Mahoney","Large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing, with frameworks like Chatbot Arena providing pioneering platforms for evaluating these models. By facilitating millions of pairwise comparisons based on human judgments, Chatbot Arena has become a cornerstone in LLM evaluation, offering rich datasets for ranking models in open-ended conversational tasks. Building upon this foundation, we propose a statistical framework that incorporates key advancements to address specific challenges in pairwise comparison analysis. First, we introduce a factored tie model that enhances the ability to handle ties—an integral aspect of human-judged comparisons—significantly improving the model's fit to observed data. Second, we extend the framework to model covariance between competitors, enabling deeper insights into performance relationships and facilitating intuitive groupings into performance tiers. Third, we resolve optimization challenges arising from parameter non-uniqueness by introducing novel constraints, ensuring stable and interpretable parameter estimation. Through rigorous evaluation and extensive experimentation, our framework demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in modeling pairwise comparison data. To support reproducibility and practical adoption, we release leaderbot, an open-source Python package implementing our models and analyses."
Poster,A Stochastic Approach to the Subset Selection Problem via Mirror Descent,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30952,"Dan Greenstein, Elazar Gershuni, Ilan Ben-Bassat, Yaroslav Fyodorov, Ran Moshe, Fiana Raiber, Alex Shtoff, Oren Somekh, Nadav Hallak","The subset selection problem is fundamental in machine learning and other fields of computer science.We introduce a stochastic formulation for the minimum cost subset selection problem in a black box setting, in which only the subset metric value is available.Subsequently, we can handle two-stage schemes, with an outer subset-selection component and an inner subset cost evaluation component. We propose formulating the subset selection problem in a stochastic manner by choosing subsets at random from a distribution whose parameters are learned. Two stochastic formulations are proposed.The first explicitly restricts the subset's cardinality, and the second yields the desired cardinality in expectation.The distribution is parameterized by a decision variable, which we optimize using Stochastic Mirror Descent.Our choice of distributions yields constructive closed-form unbiased stochastic gradient formulas and convergence guarantees, including a rate with favorable dependency on the problem parameters.Empirical evaluation of selecting a subset of layers in transfer learning complements our theoretical findings and demonstrates the potential benefits of our approach."
Poster,ASTrA: Adversarial Self-supervised Training with Adaptive-Attacks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29209,"Prakash Chandra Chhipa, Gautam Vashishtha, Jithamanyu Settur, Rajkumar Saini, Mubarak Shah, Marcus Liwicki","Existing self-supervised adversarial training (self-AT) methods rely on hand-crafted adversarial attack strategies for PGD attacks, which fail to adapt to the evolving learning dynamics of the model and do not account for instance-specific characteristics of images. This results in sub-optimal adversarial robustness and limits the alignment between clean and adversarial data distributions. To address this, we propose $\textit{ASTrA}$ ($\textbf{A}$dversarial $\textbf{S}$elf-supervised $\textbf{Tr}$aining with $\textbf{A}$daptive-Attacks), a novel framework introducing a learnable, self-supervised attack strategy network that autonomously discovers optimal attack parameters through exploration-exploitation in a single training episode. ASTrA leverages a reward mechanism based on contrastive loss, optimized with REINFORCE, enabling adaptive attack strategies without labeled data or additional hyperparameters. We further introduce a mixed contrastive objective to align the distribution of clean and adversarial examples in representation space. ASTrA achieves state-of-the-art results on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and STL10 while integrating seamlessly as a plug-and-play module for other self-AT methods. ASTrA shows scalability to larger datasets, demonstrates strong semi-supervised performance, and is resilient to robust overfitting, backed by explainability analysis on optimal attack strategies.

Poster,AstroCompress: A benchmark dataset for multi-purpose compression of astronomical data,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28585,"Tuan Truong, Rithwik Sudharsan, Yibo Yang, Peter Xiangyuan, Ruihan Yang, Stephan Mandt, Joshua Bloom","The site conditions that make astronomical observatories in space and on the ground so desirable---cold and dark---demand a physical remoteness that leads to limited data transmission capabilities. Such transmission limitations directly bottleneck the amount of data acquired and in an era of costly modern observatories, any improvements in lossless data compression has the potential scale to billions of dollars worth of additional science that can be accomplished on the same instrument. Traditional lossless methods for compressing astrophysical data are manually designed. Neural data compression, on the other hand, holds the promise of learning compression algorithms end-to-end from data and outperforming classical techniques by leveraging the unique spatial, temporal, and wavelength structures of astronomical images. This paper introduces [AstroCompress](https://huggingface.co/AstroCompress): a neural compression challenge for astrophysics data, featuring four new datasets (and one legacy dataset) with 16-bit unsigned integer imaging data in various modes: space-based, ground-based, multi-wavelength, and time-series imaging. We provide code to easily access the data and benchmark seven lossless compression methods  (three neural and four non-neural, including all practical state-of-the-art algorithms).Our results on lossless compression indicate that lossless neural compression techniques can enhance data collection at observatories, and provide guidance on the adoption of neural compression in scientific applications. Though the scope of this paper is restricted to lossless compression, we also comment on the potential exploration of lossy compression methods in future studies."
Poster,Asymmetric Factorized Bilinear Operation for Vision Transformer,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29941,"Junjie Wu, Qilong Wang, Jiangtao Xie, Pengfei Zhu, Qinghua Hu","As a core component of Transformer-like deep architectures, a feed-forward network (FFN) for channel mixing is responsible for learning features of each token. Recent works show channel mixing can be enhanced by increasing computational burden or can be slimmed at the sacrifice of performance. Although some efforts have been made, existing works are still struggling to solve the paradox of performance and complexity trade-offs. In this paper, we propose an Asymmetric Factorized Bilinear Operation (AFBO) to replace FFN of vision transformer (ViT), which attempts to efficiently explore rich statistics of token features for achieving better performance and complexity trade-off. Specifically, our AFBO computes second-order statistics via a spatial-channel factorized bilinear operation for feature learning, which replaces a simple linear projection in FFN and enhances the feature learning ability of ViT by modeling second-order correlation among token features. Furthermore, our AFBO presents two structured-sparsity channel mapping strategies, namely Grouped Cross Channel Mapping (GCCM) and Overlapped Cycle Channel Mapping (OCCM). They decompose bilinear operation into grouped channel features by considering information interaction between groups, significantly reducing computational complexity while guaranteeing model performance. Finally, our AFBO is built with GCCM and OCCM in an asymmetric way, aiming to achieve a better trade-off. Note that our AFBO is model-agnostic, which can be flexibly integrated with existing ViTs. Experiments are conducted with twenty ViTs on various tasks, and the results show our AFBO is superior to its counterparts while improving existing ViTs in terms of generalization and robustness."
Poster,Asymptotic Analysis of Two-Layer Neural Networks after One Gradient Step under Gaussian Mixtures Data with Structure,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28057,"Samet Demir, Zafer Dogan","In this work, we study the training and generalization performance of two-layer neural networks (NNs) after one gradient descent step under structured data modeled by Gaussian mixtures. While previous research has extensively analyzed this model under isotropic data assumption, such simplifications overlook the complexities inherent in real-world datasets. Our work addresses this limitation by analyzing two-layer NNs under Gaussian mixture data assumption in the asymptotically proportional limit, where the input dimension, number of hidden neurons, and sample size grow with finite ratios. We characterize the training and generalization errors by leveraging recent advancements in Gaussian universality. Specifically, we prove that a high-order polynomial model performs equivalent to the non-linear neural networks under certain conditions. The degree of the equivalent model is intricately linked to both the ""data spread"" and the learning rate employed during one gradient step. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the equivalence between the original model and its polynomial counterpart across various regression and classification tasks. Additionally, we explore how different properties of Gaussian mixtures affect learning outcomes. Finally, we illustrate experimental results on Fashion-MNIST classification, indicating that our findings can translate to realistic data."
Poster,Asynchronous Federated Reinforcement Learning with Policy Gradient Updates: Algorithm Design and Convergence Analysis,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30959,"Guangchen (Eric) Lan, Dong-Jun Han, Abolfazl Hashemi, Vaneet Aggarwal, Christopher Brinton","To improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL), we propose a novel asynchronous federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework termed AFedPG, which constructs a global model through collaboration among $N$ agents using policy gradient (PG) updates. To address the challenge of lagged policies in asynchronous settings, we design a delay-adaptive lookahead technique *specifically for FedRL* that can effectively handle heterogeneous arrival times of policy gradients. We analyze the theoretical global convergence bound of AFedPG, and characterize the advantage of the proposed algorithm in terms of both the sample complexity and time complexity. Specifically, our AFedPG method achieves $\mathcal{O}(\frac{{\epsilon}^{-2.5}}{N})$ sample complexity for global convergence at each agent on average. Compared to the single agent setting with $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2.5})$ sample complexity, it enjoys a linear speedup with respect to the number of agents. Moreover, compared to synchronous FedPG, AFedPG improves the time complexity from $\mathcal{O}(\frac{t_{\max}}{N})$ to $\mathcal{O}({\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{t_{i}}})^{-1}$, where $t_{i}$ denotes the time consumption in each iteration at agent $i$, and $t_{\max}$ is the largest one. The latter complexity $\mathcal{O}({\sum_{i=1}^{N} \frac{1}{t_{i}}})^{-1}$ is always smaller than the former one, and this improvement becomes significant in large-scale federated settings with heterogeneous computing powers ($t_{\max}\gg t_{\min}$). Finally, we empirically verify the improved performance of AFedPG in four widely used MuJoCo environments with varying numbers of agents. We also demonstrate the advantages of AFedPG in various computing heterogeneity scenarios."
Poster,Asynchronous RLHF: Faster and More Efficient Off-Policy RL for Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30332,"Michael Noukhovitch, Shengyi Huang, Sophie Xhonneux, Arian Hosseini, Rishabh Agarwal, Aaron Courville","The dominant paradigm for RLHF is *online* and *on-policy* RL: synchronously generating from the large language model (LLM) policy, labelling with a reward model, and learning using feedback on the LLM's own outputs. While performant, this paradigm is computationally inefficient. Inspired by classical deep RL literature, we propose separating generation and learning in RLHF. This enables asynchronous generation of new samples while simultaneously training  on old samples, leading to faster training and more compute-optimal scaling. However, asynchronous training relies on an underexplored regime, online but *off-policy* RLHF: learning on samples from previous iterations of our model which give a worse training signal. We tackle the fundamental challenge in this regime: how much off-policyness can we tolerate for asynchronous training to speed up learning but maintain performance? Among several RLHF algorithms we test, online DPO is found to be most robust to off-policy data, and robustness increases with the scale of the policy model. We study further compute optimizations for asynchronous RLHF but find that they come at a performance cost, giving rise to a trade-off. We verify the scalability of asynchronous RLHF by training a general-purpose chatbot from LLaMA 3.1 8B on an instruction-following task $\sim$40\% faster than a synchronous run while matching final performance. Finally, we extend our results to math and reasoning to demonstrate asynchronous RL can finetune Rho 1B on GSM8k $\sim$70\% faster while matching synchronous accuracy."
Poster,A Theoretical Analysis of Self-Supervised Learning for Vision Transformers,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30614,"Yu Huang, Zixin Wen, Yuejie Chi, Yingbin Liang","Self-supervised learning has become a cornerstone in computer vision, primarily divided into reconstruction-based methods like masked autoencoders (MAE) and discriminative methods such as contrastive learning (CL).  Recent empirical observations reveal that MAE and CL capture different types of representations: CL tends to focus on global patterns, while MAE adeptly captures  **both global and subtle local** information simultaneously. Despite a flurry of recent empirical investigations to shed light on this difference, theoretical understanding remains limited, especially on the dominant architecture **vision  transformers** (ViTs). In this paper, to provide rigorous insights, we model the visual data distribution by considering two types of spatial features: dominant global features and comparatively minuscule local features, and study the impact of imbalance among these features.  We analyze the training dynamics of one-layer softmax-based ViTs on both MAE and CL objectives using gradient descent. Our analysis shows that as the degree of feature imbalance varies, ViTs trained with the MAE objective effectively learn both global and local features to achieve near-optimal reconstruction, while the CL-trained ViTs favor predominantly global features, even under mild imbalance. These results provide a theoretical explanation for distinct behaviors of MAE and CL observed in empirical studies."
