Poster,MMR: A Large-scale Benchmark Dataset for Multi-target and Multi-granularity Reasoning Segmentation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28436,"Donggon Jang, Yucheol Cho, Suin Lee, Taehyeon Kim, DAE SHIK KIM","The fusion of Large Language Models (LLMs) with vision models is pioneering new possibilities in user-interactive vision-language tasks. A notable application is reasoning segmentation, where models generate pixel-level segmentation masks by comprehending implicit meanings in human instructions. However, seamless human-AI interaction demands more than just object-level recognition; it requires understanding both objects and the functions of their detailed parts, particularly in multi-target scenarios. For example, when instructing a robot to \textit{“turn on the TV""}, there could be various ways to accomplish this command. Recognizing multiple objects capable of turning on the TV, such as the TV itself or a remote control (multi-target), provides more flexible options and aids in finding the optimized scenario. Furthermore, understanding specific parts of these objects, like the TV's button or the remote's button (part-level), is important for completing the action. Unfortunately, current reasoning segmentation datasets predominantly focus on a single target object-level reasoning, which limits the detailed recognition of an object's parts in multi-target contexts. To address this gap, we construct a large-scale dataset called Multi-target and Multi-granularity Reasoning (MMR). MMR comprises 194K complex and implicit instructions that consider multi-target, object-level, and part-level aspects, based on pre-existing image-mask sets. This dataset supports diverse and context-aware interactions by hierarchically providing object and part information. Moreover, we propose a straightforward yet effective framework for multi-target, object-level, and part-level reasoning segmentation. Experimental results on MMR show that the proposed method can reason effectively in multi-target and multi-granularity scenarios, while the existing reasoning segmentation model still has room for improvement. The dataset is available at \url{https://github.com/jdg900/MMR}."
Poster,MMRole: A Comprehensive Framework for Developing and Evaluating Multimodal Role-Playing Agents,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30350,"Yanqi Dai, Huanran Hu, Lei Wang, Shengjie Jin, Xu Chen, Zhiwu Lu","Recently, Role-Playing Agents (RPAs) have garnered increasing attention for their potential to deliver emotional value and facilitate sociological research.However, existing studies are primarily confined to the textual modality, unable to simulate humans' multimodal perceptual capabilities.To bridge this gap, we introduce the concept of Multimodal Role-Playing Agents (MRPAs), and propose a comprehensive framework, MMRole, for their development and evaluation, which comprises a personalized multimodal dataset and a robust evaluation approach.Specifically, we construct a large-scale, high-quality dataset, MMRole-Data, consisting of 85 characters, 11K images, and 14K single or multi-turn dialogues.Additionally, we present a robust evaluation approach, MMRole-Eval, encompassing eight metrics across three dimensions, where a reward model is designed to score MRPAs with the constructed ground-truth data for comparison.Moreover, we develop the first specialized MRPA, MMRole-Agent.Extensive evaluation results demonstrate the improved performance of MMRole-Agent and highlight the primary challenges in developing MRPAs, emphasizing the need for enhanced multimodal understanding and role-playing consistency.The data, code, and models are all available at https://github.com/YanqiDai/MMRole."
Poster,MMSearch: Unveiling the Potential of Large Models as Multi-modal Search Engines,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30134,"Dongzhi Jiang, Renrui Zhang, Ziyu Guo, Yanmin Wu, jiayi lei, Pengshuo Qiu, Pan Lu, Zehui Chen, Guanglu Song, Gao Peng, Yu Liu, Chunyuan Li, Hongsheng Li","The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has paved the way for AI search engines, e.g., SearchGPT, showcasing a new paradigm in human-internet interaction. However, most current AI search engines are limited to text-only settings, neglecting the multimodal user queries and the text-image interleaved nature of website information. Recently, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have made impressive strides. Yet, whether they can function as AI search engines remains under-explored, leaving the potential of LMMs in multimodal search an open question. To this end, we first design a delicate pipeline, MMSearch-Engine, to empower any LMMs with multimodal search capabilities. On top of this, we introduce MMSearch, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark to assess the multimodal search performance of LMMs. The curated dataset contains 300 manually collected instances spanning 14 subfields, which involves no overlap with the current LMMs' training data, ensuring the correct answer can only be obtained within searching. By using MMSearch-Engine, the LMMs are evaluated by performing three individual tasks (requery, rerank, and summarization), and one challenging end-to-end task with a complete searching process. We conduct extensive experiments on closed-source and open-source LMMs. Among all tested models, GPT-4o with MMSearch-Engine achieves the best results, which surpasses the commercial product, Perplexity Pro, in the end-to-end task, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline. We further present error analysis to unveil current LMMs still struggle to fully grasp the multimodal search tasks, and conduct ablation study to indicate the potential of scaling test-time computation for AI search engine. We hope MMSearch may provide unique insights to guide the future development of multimodal AI search engine."
Poster,MMTEB: Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27651,"Kenneth Enevoldsen, Isaac Chung, Imene Kerboua, Márton Kardos, Ashwin Mathur, David Stap, Jay Gala, Wissam Siblini, Dominik Krzemiński, Genta Winata, Saba Sturua, Saiteja Utpala, Mathieu Ciancone, Marion Schaeffer, Diganta Misra, Shreeya Dhakal, Jonathan Rystrøm, Roman Solomatin, Ömer Çağatan, Akash Kundu, Martin Bernstorff, Shitao Xiao, Akshita Sukhlecha, Bhavish Pahwa, Rafał Poświata, Kranthi Kiran GV, Shawon Ashraf, Daniel Auras, Björn Plüster, Jan Harries, Loïc Magne, Isabelle Mohr, Dawei Zhu, Hippolyte Gisserot-Boukhlef, Tom Aarsen, Jan Kostkan, Konrad Wojtasik, Taemin Lee, Marek Suppa, Crystina Zhang, Roberta Rocca, Mohammed Hamdy, Andrianos Michail, John Yang, Manuel Faysse, Aleksei Vatolin, Nandan Thakur, Manan Dey, Dipam Vasani, Pranjal Chitale, Simone Tedeschi, Nguyen Tai, Artem Snegirev, Mariya Hendriksen, Michael Günther, Mengzhou Xia, Weijia Shi, Xing Han Lu, Jordan Clive, Gayatri K, Maksimova Anna, Silvan Wehrli, Maria Tikhonova, Henil Panchal, Aleksandr Abramov, Malte Ostendorff, Zheng Liu, Simon Clematide, Lester James V.

To circumvent this limitation and to provide a more comprehensive evaluation, we introduce the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB) -- a large-scale community-driven initiative expanding MTEB to over 500 quality-controlled evaluation tasks across 1,000+ languages. MMTEB includes a wide range of challenging novel tasks such as instruction following, long-document retrieval, and code retrieval, and represents the largest multilingual collection of evaluation tasks for embedding models to date. We use this collection to construct multiple highly multilingual benchmarks. We evaluate a representative set of models on these benchmarks.Our findings indicate that, while LLM-based models can achieve state-of-the-art performance on a subset of languages, the best-performing publicly available model across languages is the notably smaller, multilingual-e5-large-instruct.Massive benchmarks often impose high computational demands, limiting accessibility, particularly for low-resource communities. To address this, we downsample tasks based on inter-task correlation (i.e., selecting only a diverse set of tasks) while preserving relative rankings.We further optimize tasks such as retrieval by sampling hard negatives, creating smaller but effective splits. These optimizations allow us to introduce benchmarks at a significantly lower computational cost. For instance, we introduce a new zero-shot English benchmark that maintains a similar ordering at a fraction of the cost."
Poster,MMWorld: Towards Multi-discipline Multi-faceted World Model Evaluation in Videos,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28053,"Xuehai He, Weixi Feng, Kaizhi Zheng, Yujie Lu, Wanrong Zhu, Jiachen Li, Yue Fan, Jianfeng Wang, Linjie Li, Zhengyuan Yang, Kevin Lin, William Wang, Lijuan Wang, Xin Wang","Multimodal Language Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate the emerging abilities of ""world models""---interpreting and reasoning about complex real-world dynamics. To assess these abilities, we posit videos are the ideal medium, as they encapsulate rich representations of real-world dynamics and causalities. To this end, we introduce MMWorld, a new benchmark for multi-discipline, multi-faceted multimodal video understanding. MMWorld distinguishes itself from previous video understanding benchmarks with two unique advantages: (1) multi-discipline, covering various disciplines that often require domain expertise for comprehensive understanding; (2) multi-faceted reasoning, including explanation, counterfactual thinking, future prediction, etc. MMWorld consists of a human-annotated dataset to evaluate MLLMs with questions about the whole videos and a synthetic dataset to analyze MLLMs within a single modality of perception. Together, MMWorld encompasses 1,910 videos across seven broad disciplines and 69 subdisciplines, complete with 6,627 question-answer pairs and associated captions. The evaluation includes 4 proprietary and 11 open-source MLLMs, which struggle on MMWorld (e.g., GPT-4o performs the best with only 62.5% accuracy), showing large room for improvement. Further ablation studies reveal other interesting findings such as models' different skill sets from humans. We hope MMWorld can serve as an essential step towards world model evaluation in videos."
Poster,MOCA: Self-supervised Representation Learning by Predicting Masked Online Codebook Assignments,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31503,"MATTHIEU CORD, Antonin Vobecky, Oriane Siméoni, Patrick Perez, Nikos Komodakis, Spyros Gidaris, Andrei Bursuc","Self-supervised learning can be used for mitigating the greedy needs of Vision Transformer networks for very large fully-annotated datasets. Different classes of self-supervised learning offer representations with either good contextual reasoning properties, e.g., using masked image modeling strategies, or invariance to image perturbations, e.g., with contrastive methods. In this work, we propose a single-stage and standalone method, MOCA, which unifies both desired properties using novel mask-and-predict objectives defined with high-level features (instead of pixel-level details). Moreover, we show how to effectively employ both learning paradigms in a synergistic and computation-efficient way. Doing so, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on low-shot settings and strong experimental results in various evaluation protocols with a training that is at least 3 times faster than prior methods. We provide the implementation code at https://github.com/valeoai/MOCA."
Poster,Modality-Specialized Synergizers for Interleaved Vision-Language Generalists,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30822,"Zhiyang Xu, Minqian Liu, Ying Shen, Joy Rimchala, Jiaxin Zhang, Qifan Wang, Yu Cheng, Lifu Huang","Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have led to the emergence of Vision-Language Generalists (VLGs) capable of understanding and generating both text and images. However, seamlessly generating an arbitrary sequence of text and images remains a challenging task for the current VLGs. One primary limitation lies in applying a unified architecture and the same set of parameters to simultaneously model discrete text tokens and continuous image features. Recent works attempt to tackle this fundamental problem by introducing modality-aware expert models. However, they employ identical architectures to process both text and images, disregarding the intrinsic inductive biases in these two modalities. In this work, we introduce Modality-Specialized Synergizers (MoSS), a novel design that efficiently optimizes existing unified architectures of VLGs with modality-specialized adaptation layers, i.e., a Convolutional LoRA for modeling the local priors of image patches and a Linear LoRA for processing sequential text. This design enables more effective modeling of modality-specific features while maintaining the strong cross-modal integration gained from pretraining. In addition, to improve the instruction-following capability on interleaved text-and-image generation, we introduce LeafInstruct, the first open-sourced interleaved instruction tuning dataset comprising 184,982 high-quality instances on more than 10 diverse domains. Extensive experiments show that VLGs integrated with MoSS achieve state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing baseline VLGs in complex interleaved generation tasks. Furthermore, our method exhibits strong generalizability on different VLGs."
Poster,MoDeGPT: Modular Decomposition for Large Language Model Compression,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30778,"Chi-Heng Lin, Shangqian Gao, James Smith, Abhishek Patel, Shikhar Tuli, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin, Yen-Chang Hsu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced AI with their exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks. However, their extensive computational requirements restrict their use on devices with limited resources.While recent compression methods based on low-rank matrices show potentialsolutions, they often suffer from significant loss of accuracy or introduce substantialoverhead in parameters and inference time. In this paper, we introduce Modular De-composition (MoDeGPT), a new, efficient, and structured compression frameworkthat overcomes these limitations. MoDeGPT jointly decomposes pairs of consecu-tive subcomponents within Transformer blocks, reduces hidden dimensions throughoutput reconstruction on a larger structural scale than conventional low-rank meth-ods, and repurposes three classical matrix decomposition algorithms—Nyströmapproximation, CR decomposition, and SVD—to ensure bounded errors in ournovel decomposition approach. Our experiments show that MoDeGPT, withoutrelying on backward propagation, consistently matches or surpasses the performance of prior techniques that depend on gradient information, while achieving a98% reduction in compute costs when compressing a 13B-parameter model. OnLLaMA-2/3 and OPT models, MoDeGPT retains 90-95% of zero-shot performancewith compression rates of 25-30%. The compression process can be completed ona single GPU in a few hours, boosting inference throughput by up to 46%."
Poster,Model-Agnostic Knowledge Guided Correction for Improved Neural Surrogate Rollout,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31063,"Bharat Srikishan, Daniel O&#x27;Malley, Mohamed Mehana, Nicholas Lubbers, Nikhil Muralidhar","Modeling the evolution of physical systems is critical to many applications in science and engineering. As the evolution of these systems is governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), there are a number of computational simulations which resolve these systems with high accuracy. However, as these simulations incur high computational costs, they are infeasible to be employed for large-scale analysis. A popular alternative to simulators are neural network surrogates which are trained in a data-driven manner and are much more computationally efficient. However, these surrogate models suffer from high rollout error when used autoregressively, especially when confronted with training data paucity. Existing work proposes to improve surrogate rollout error by either including physical loss terms directly in the optimization of the model or incorporating computational simulators as `differentiable layers' in the neural network. Both of these approaches have their challenges, with physical loss functions suffering from slow convergence for stiff PDEs and simulator layers requiring gradients which are not always available, especially in legacy simulators. We propose the Hybrid PDE Predictor with Reinforcement Learning (HyPER) model: a model-agnostic, RL based, cost-aware model which combines a neural surrogate, RL decision model, and a physics simulator (with or without gradients) to reduce surrogate rollout error significantly. In addition to reducing in-distribution rollout error by **47%-78%**, HyPER learns an intelligent policy that is adaptable to changing physical conditions and resistant to noise corruption.

Poster,Model-agnostic meta-learners for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects over time,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29699,"Dennis Frauen, Konstantin Hess, Stefan Feuerriegel","Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) over time is crucial in many disciplines such as personalized medicine. Existing works for this task have mostly focused on *model-based* learners that adapt specific machine-learning models and adjustment mechanisms. In contrast, model-agnostic learners - so-called *meta-learners* - are largely unexplored. In our paper, we propose several meta-learners that are model-agnostic and thus can be used in combination with arbitrary machine learning models (e.g., transformers) to estimate HTEs over time. We then provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis that characterizes the different learners and that allows us to offer insights into when specific learners are preferable. Furthermore, we propose a novel IVW-DR-learner that (i) uses a doubly robust (DR) and orthogonal loss; and (ii) leverages inverse-variance weights (IVWs) that we derive to stabilize the DR-loss over time. Our IVWs downweight extreme trajectories due to *products* of inverse-propensities in the DR-loss, resulting in a lower estimation variance. Our IVW-DR-learner achieves superior performance in our experiments, particularly in regimes with low overlap and long time horizons."
