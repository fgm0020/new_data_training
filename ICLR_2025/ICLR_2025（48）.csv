Poster,CameraCtrl: Enabling Camera Control for Video Diffusion Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29236,"Hao He, Yinghao Xu, Yuwei Guo, Gordon Wetzstein, Bo DAI, Hongsheng Li, Ceyuan Yang","Controllability plays a crucial role in video generation, as it allows users to create and edit content more precisely. Existing models, however, lack control of camera pose that serves as a cinematic language to express deeper narrative nuances. To alleviate this issue, we introduce \method, enabling accurate camera pose control for video diffusion models. Our approach explores effective camera trajectory parameterization along with a plug-and-play camera pose control module that is trained on top of a video diffusion model, leaving other modules of the base model untouched. Moreover, a comprehensive study on the effect of various training datasets is conducted, suggesting that videos with diverse camera distributions and similar appearance to the base model indeed enhance controllability and generalization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of \method in achieving precise camera control with different video generation models, marking a step forward in the pursuit of dynamic and customized video storytelling from textual and camera pose inputs."
Poster,CAMEx: Curvature-aware Merging of Experts,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28408,"Dung Viet Nguyen, Minh Nguyen, Luc Nguyen, Rachel Teo, Tan Nguyen, Duy Linh Tran","Existing methods for merging experts during model training and fine-tuning predominantly rely on Euclidean geometry, which assumes a flat parameter space. This assumption can limit the model's generalization ability, especially during the pre-training phase, where the parameter manifold might exhibit more complex curvature. Curvature-aware merging methods typically require additional information and computational resources to approximate the Fisher Information Matrix, adding memory overhead. In this paper, we introduce CAMEx (Curvature-Aware Merging of Experts), a novel expert merging protocol that incorporates natural gradients to account for the non-Euclidean curvature of the parameter manifold. By leveraging natural gradients, CAMEx adapts more effectively to the structure of the parameter space, improving alignment between model updates and the manifold's geometry. This approach enhances both pre-training and fine-tuning, resulting in better optimization trajectories and improved generalization without the substantial memory overhead typically associated with curvature-aware methods. Our contributions are threefold: (1) CAMEx significantly outperforms traditional Euclidean-based expert merging techniques across various natural language processing tasks, leading to enhanced performance during pre-training and fine-tuning; (2) we introduce a dynamic merging architecture that optimizes resource utilization, achieving high performance while reducing computational costs, facilitating efficient scaling of large language models; and (3) we provide both theoretical and empirical evidence to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed method. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/kpup1710/CAMEx."
Poster,Can a Large Language Model be a Gaslighter?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/32085,"Wei Li, Luyao Zhu, Yang Song, Ruixi Lin, Rui Mao, Yang You","Large language models (LLMs) have gained human trust due to their capabilities and helpfulness. However, this in turn may allow LLMs to affect users' mindsets by manipulating language. It is termed as gaslighting, a psychological effect. In this work, we aim to investigate the vulnerability of LLMs under prompt-based and fine-tuning-based gaslighting attacks. Therefore, we propose a two-stage framework DeepCoG designed to: 1) elicit gaslighting plans from LLMs with the proposed DeepGaslighting prompting template, and 2) acquire gaslighting conversations from LLMs through our Chain-of-Gaslighting method. The gaslighting conversation dataset along with a corresponding safe dataset is applied to fine-tuning-based attacks on open-source LLMs and anti-gaslighting safety alignment on these LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that both prompt-based and fine-tuning-based attacks transform three open-source LLMs into gaslighters. In contrast, we advanced three safety alignment strategies to strengthen~(by $12.05\%$) the safety guardrail of LLMs. Our safety alignment strategies have minimal impacts on the utility of LLMs. Empirical studies indicate that an LLM may be a potential gaslighter, even if it passed the harmfulness test on general dangerous queries."
Poster,Can a MISL Fly? Analysis and Ingredients for Mutual Information Skill Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27762,"Chongyi Zheng, Jens Tuyls, Joanne Peng, Benjamin Eysenbach","Self-supervised learning has the potential of lifting several of the key challenges in reinforcement learning today, such as exploration, representation learning, and reward design. Recent work (METRA) has effectively argued that moving away from mutual information and instead optimizing a certain Wasserstein distance is important for good performance. In this paper, we argue that the benefits seen in that paper can largely be explained within the existing framework of mutual information skill learning (MISL).Our analysis suggests a new MISL method (contrastive successor features) that retains the excellent performance of METRA with fewer moving parts, and highlights connections between skill learning, contrastive representation learning, and successor features. Finally, through careful ablation studies, we provide further insight into some of the key ingredients for both our method and METRA."
Poster,Can Generative AI Solve Your In-Context Learning Problem?  A Martingale Perspective,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29101,"Andrew Jesson, Nicolas Beltran-Velez, David Blei","This work is about estimating when a conditional generative model (CGM) can solve an in-context learning (ICL) problem. An in-context learning (ICL) problem comprises a CGM, a dataset, and a prediction task. The CGM could be a multi-modal foundation model; the dataset, a collection of patient histories, test results, and recorded diagnoses; and the prediction task to communicate a diagnosis to a new patient. A Bayesian interpretation of ICL assumes that the CGM computes a posterior predictive distribution over an unknown Bayesian model defining a joint distribution over latent explanations and observable data. From this perspective, Bayesian model criticism is a reasonable approach to assess the suitability of a given CGM for an ICL problem. However, such approaches---like posterior predictive checks (PPCs)---often assume that we can sample from the likelihood and posterior defined by the Bayesian model, which are not explicitly given for contemporary CGMs. To address this, we show when ancestral sampling from the predictive distribution of a CGM is equivalent to sampling datasets from the posterior predictive of the assumed Bayesian model. Then we develop the generative predictive $p$-value, which enables PPCs and their cousins for contemporary CGMs. The generative predictive $p$-value can be used in a statistical decision procedure to determine when the model is appropriate for an ICL problem. Our method only requires generating queries and responses from a CGM and evaluating its response log probability. Using large language models, we empirically evaluate our method on tasks involving tabular data, imaging data, and natural language data."
Poster,Can In-context Learning Really Generalize to Out-of-distribution Tasks?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30175,"Qixun Wang, Yifei Wang, Xianghua Ying, Yisen Wang","In this work, we explore the mechanism of in-context learning (ICL) on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks that were not encountered during training. To achieve this, we conduct synthetic experiments where the objective is to learn OOD mathematical functions through ICL using a GPT-2 model. We reveal that Transformers may struggle to learn OOD task functions through ICL. Specifically, ICL performance resembles implementing a function within the pretraining hypothesis space and optimizing it with gradient descent based on the in-context examples. Additionally, we investigate ICL's well-documented ability to learn unseen abstract labels in context. We demonstrate that such ability only manifests in the scenarios without distributional shifts and, therefore, may not serve as evidence of new-task-learning ability. Furthermore, we assess ICL's performance on OOD tasks when the model is pretrained on multiple tasks. Both empirical and theoretical analyses demonstrate the existence of the \textbf{low-test-error preference} of ICL, where it tends to implement the pretraining function that yields low test error in the testing context. We validate this through numerical experiments. This new theoretical result, combined with our empirical findings, elucidates the mechanism of ICL in addressing OOD tasks."
Poster,Can Knowledge Editing Really Correct Hallucinations?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28744,"Baixiang Huang, Canyu Chen, Xiongxiao Xu, Ali Payani, Kai Shu","Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations, referring to the non-factual information in generated content, despite their superior capacities across tasks. Meanwhile, knowledge editing has been developed as a new popular paradigm to correct  erroneous factual knowledge encoded in LLMs with the advantage of avoiding retraining from scratch. However, a common issue of existing evaluation datasets for knowledge editing is that they do not ensure that LLMs actually generate hallucinated answers to the evaluation questions before editing. When LLMs are evaluated on such datasets after being edited by different techniques, it is hard to directly adopt the performance to assess the effectiveness of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations. Thus, the fundamental question remains insufficiently validated: Can knowledge editing really correct hallucinations in LLMs? We proposed HalluEditBench to holistically benchmark knowledge editing methods in correcting real-world hallucinations. First, we rigorously construct a massive hallucination dataset with 9 domains, 26 topics and more than 6,000 hallucinations. Then, we assess the performance of knowledge editing methods in a holistic way on five dimensions including Efficacy, Generalization, Portability, Locality, and Robustness. Through HalluEditBench, we have provided new insights into the potentials and limitations of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations, which could inspire future improvements and facilitate progress in the field of knowledge editing."
Poster,Can Large Language Models Understand Symbolic Graphics Programs?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29250,"Zeju Qiu, Weiyang Liu, Haiwen Feng, Zhen Liu, Tim Xiao, Katherine Collins, Joshua B Tenenbaum, Adrian Weller, Michael J Black, Bernhard Schölkopf","Against the backdrop of enthusiasm for large language models (LLMs), there is a growing need to scientifically assess their capabilities and shortcomings. This is nontrivial in part because it is difficult to find tasks which the models have not encountered during training. Utilizing symbolic graphics programs, we propose a domain well-suited to test multiple spatial-semantic reasoning skills of LLMs. Popular in computer graphics, these programs procedurally generate visual data. While LLMs exhibit impressive skills in general program synthesis and analysis, symbolic graphics programs offer a new layer of evaluation: they allow us to test an LLM's ability to answer semantic questions about the images or 3D geometries without a vision encoder. To semantically understand the symbolic programs, LLMs would need to possess the ability to ""imagine"" and reason how the corresponding graphics content would look with only the symbolic description of the local curvatures and strokes. We use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic visual understanding of symbolic graphics programs, built procedurally with minimal human effort. Particular emphasis is placed on transformations of images that leave the image level semantics invariant while introducing significant changes to the underlying program. We evaluate commercial and open-source LLMs on our benchmark to assess their ability to reason about visual output of programs, finding that LLMs considered stronger at reasoning generally perform better. Lastly, we introduce a novel method to improve this ability -- Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT), in which the LLM is finetuned with pre-collected instruction data on symbolic graphics programs. Interestingly, we find that SIT not only improves LLM's understanding on symbolic programs, but it also improves general reasoning ability on various other benchmarks."
Poster,Can LLMs Generate Novel Research Ideas? A Large-Scale Human Study with 100+ NLP Researchers,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29961,"Chenglei Si, Diyi Yang, Tatsunori Hashimoto","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have sparked optimism about their potential to accelerate scientific discovery, with a growing number of works proposing research agents that autonomously generate and validate new ideas. Despite this, no evaluations have shown that LLM systems can take the very first step of producing novel, expert-level ideas, let alone perform the entire research process. We address this by establishing an experimental design that evaluates research idea generation while controlling for confounders and performs the first comparison between expert NLP researchers and an LLM ideation agent. By recruiting over 100 NLP researchers to write novel ideas and blind reviews of both LLM and human ideas, we obtain the first statistically significant conclusion on current LLM capabilities for research ideation: we find LLM-generated ideas are judged as more novel (p < 0.05) than human expert ideas while being judged slightly weaker on feasibility. Studying our agent baselines closely, we identify open problems in building and evaluating research agents, including failures of LLM self-evaluation and their lack of diversity in generation."
Poster,Can LLM Simulations Truly Reflect Humanity? A Deep Dive,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31340,"Qian Wang, Zhenheng Tang, Bingsheng He","Simulation powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a promising method for exploring complex human social behaviors. However, the application of LLMs in simulations presents significant challenges, particularly regarding their capacity to accurately replicate the complexities of human behaviors and societal dynamics, as evidenced by recent studies highlighting discrepancies between simulated and real-world interactions. This blog rethinks LLM-based simulations by emphasizing both their limitations and the necessities for advancing LLM simulations. By critically examining these challenges, we aim to offer actionable insights and strategies for enhancing the applicability of LLM simulations in human society in the future."
