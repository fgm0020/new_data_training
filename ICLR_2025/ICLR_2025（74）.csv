Poster,CViT: Continuous Vision Transformer for Operator Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29048,"Sifan Wang, Jacob Seidman, Shyam Sankaran, Hanwen Wang, George Pappas, Paris Perdikaris","Operator learning, which aims to approximate maps between infinite-dimensional function spaces, is an important area in scientific machine learning with applications across various physical domains. Here we introduce the Continuous Vision Transformer (CViT), a novel neural operator architecture that leverages advances in computer vision to address challenges in learning complex physical systems.  CViT combines a vision transformer encoder, a novel grid-based coordinate embedding, and a query-wise cross-attention mechanism to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies. This design allows for flexible output representations and consistent evaluation at arbitrary resolutions. We demonstrate CViT's effectiveness across a diverse range of partial differential equation (PDE) systems, including fluid dynamics, climate modeling, and reaction-diffusion processes. Our comprehensive experiments show that CViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, often surpassing larger foundation models, even without extensive pretraining and roll-out fine-tuning. Taken together, CViT exhibits robust handling of discontinuous solutions, multi-scale features, and intricate spatio-temporal dynamics. Our contributions can be viewed as a significant step towards adapting advanced computer vision architectures for building more flexible and accurate machine learning models in the physical sciences."
Poster,Cybench: A Framework for Evaluating Cybersecurity Capabilities and Risks of Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28041,"Andy K Zhang, Neil Perry, Riya Dulepet, Joey Ji, Celeste Menders, Justin Lin, Eliot Jones, Gashon Hussein, Samantha Liu, Donovan Jasper, Pura Peetathawatchai, Ari Glenn, Vikram Sivashankar, Daniel Zamoshchin, Leo Glikbarg, Derek Askaryar, Haoxiang Yang, Aolin Zhang, Rishi Alluri, Nathan Tran, Rinnara Sangpisit, Kenny Oseleononmen, Dan Boneh, Daniel Ho, Percy Liang","Language Model (LM) agents for cybersecurity that are capable of autonomously identifying vulnerabilities and executing exploits have potential to cause real-world impact. Policymakers, model providers, and researchers in the AI and cybersecurity communities are interested in quantifying the capabilities of such agents to help mitigate cyberrisk and investigate opportunities for penetration testing. Toward that end, we introduce Cybench, a framework for specifying cybersecurity tasks and evaluating agents on those tasks. We include 40 professional-level Capture the Flag (CTF) tasks from 4 distinct CTF competitions, chosen to be recent, meaningful, and spanning a wide range of difficulties. Each task includes its own description, starter files, and is initialized in an environment where an agent can execute commands and observe outputs. Since many tasks are beyond the capabilities of existing LM agents, we introduce subtasks for each task, which break down a task into intermediary steps for a more detailed evaluation. To evaluate agent capabilities, we construct a cybersecurity agent and evaluate 8 models: GPT-4o, OpenAI o1-preview, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mixtral 8x22b Instruct, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B Chat, and Llama 3.1 405B Instruct. For the top performing models (GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet), we further investigate performance across 4 agent scaffolds (structured bash, action-only, pseudoterminal, and web search). Without subtask guidance, agents leveraging Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, OpenAI o1-preview, and Claude 3 Opus successfully solved complete tasks that took human teams up to 11 minutes to solve. In comparison, the most difficult task took human teams 24 hours and 54 minutes to solve.

Poster,CyberHost: A One-stage Diffusion Framework for Audio-driven Talking Body Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/32053,"Gaojie Lin, Jianwen Jiang, Chao Liang, Tianyun Zhong, Jiaqi Yang, Zerong Zheng, Yanbo Zheng","Diffusion-based video generation technology has advanced significantly, catalyzing a proliferation of research in human animation. While breakthroughs have been made in driving human animation through various modalities for portraits, most of current solutions for human body animation still focus on video-driven methods, leaving audio-driven taking body generation relatively underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CyberHost, a one-stage audio-driven talking body generation framework that addresses common synthesis degradations in half-body animation, including hand integrity, identity consistency, and natural motion.CyberHost's key designs are twofold. Firstly, the Region Attention Module (RAM) maintains a set of learnable, implicit, identity-agnostic latent features and combines them with identity-specific local visual features to enhance the synthesis of critical local regions. Secondly, the Human-Prior-Guided Conditions introduce more human structural priors into the model, reducing uncertainty in generated motion patterns and thereby improving the stability of the generated videos.To our knowledge, CyberHost is the first one-stage audio-driven human diffusion model capable of zero-shot video generation for the human body. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CyberHost surpasses previous works in both quantitative and qualitative aspects. CyberHost can also be extended to video-driven and audio-video hybrid-driven scenarios, achieving similarly satisfactory results."
Poster,CycleResearcher: Improving Automated Research via Automated Review,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/32074,"Yixuan Weng, Minjun Zhu, Guangsheng Bao, Hongbo Zhang, Jindong Wang, Yue Zhang, Linyi Yang","The automation of scientific discovery has been a long-standing goal within the research community, driven by the potential to accelerate knowledge creation. While significant progress has been made using commercial large language models (LLMs) as research assistants or idea generators, the possibility of automating the entire research process with open-source LLMs remains largely unexplored. This paper explores the feasibility of using open-source post-trained LLMs as autonomous agents capable of performing the full cycle of automated research and review, from literature review and manuscript preparation to peer review and paper refinement. Our iterative preference training framework consists of CycleResearcher, which conducts research tasks, and CycleReviewer, which simulates the peer review process, providing iterative feedback via reinforcement learning. To train these models, we develop two new datasets, Review-5k and Research-14k, reflecting real-world machine learning research and peer review dynamics. Our results demonstrate that CycleReviewer achieves promising performance with a 26.89\% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to individual human reviewers in predicting paper scores, indicating the potential of LLMs to effectively assist expert-level research evaluation. In research, the papers generated by the CycleResearcher model achieved a score of 5.36 in simulated peer reviews, showing some competitiveness in terms of simulated review scores compared to the preprint level of 5.24 from human experts, while still having room for improvement compared to the accepted paper level of 5.69. This work represents a significant step toward fully automated scientific inquiry, providing ethical safeguards and exploring AI-driven research capabilities.

Poster,Cyclic Contrastive Knowledge Transfer for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30109,"Chuhan ZHANG, Chaoyang Zhu, Pingcheng Dong, Long Chen, Dong Zhang","In pursuit of detecting unstinted objects that extend beyond predefined categories, prior arts of open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) typically resort to pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) for base-to-novel category generalization. However, to mitigate the misalignment between upstream image-text pretraining and downstream region-level perception, additional supervisions are indispensable, e.g., image-text pairs or pseudo annotations generated via self-training strategies. In this work, we propose CCKT-Det trained without any extra supervision. The proposed framework constructs a cyclic and dynamic knowledge transfer from language queries and visual region features extracted from VLMs, which forces the detector to closely align with the visual-semantic space of VLMs. Specifically, 1) we prefilter and inject semantic priors to guide the learning of queries, and 2) introduce a regional contrastive loss to improve the awareness of queries on novel objects. CCKT-Det can consistently improve performance as the scale of VLMs increases, all while requiring the detector at a moderate level of computation overhead. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves performance gain of +2.9% and +10.2% AP_{50} over previous state-of-the-arts on the challenging COCO benchmark, both without and with a stronger teacher model."
Poster,DailyDilemmas: Revealing Value Preferences of LLMs with Quandaries of Daily Life,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29764,"Yu Ying Chiu, Liwei Jiang, Yejin Choi","As users increasingly seek guidance from LLMs for decision-making in daily life, many of these decisions are not clear-cut and depend significantly on the personal values and ethical standards of people. We present DailyDilemmas, a dataset of 1,360 moral dilemmas encountered in everyday life. Each dilemma presents two possible actions, along with affected parties and relevant human values for each action. Based on these dilemmas, we gather a repository of human values covering diverse everyday topics, such as interpersonal relationships, workplace, and environmental issues. With DailyDilemmas, we evaluate LLMs on these dilemmas to determine what action they will choose and the values represented by these action choices. Then, we analyze values through the lens of five theoretical frameworks inspired by sociology, psychology, and philosophy, including the World Values Survey, Moral Foundations Theory, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, Aristotle's Virtues, and Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions. For instance, we find LLMs are most aligned with self-expression over survival in World Values Survey and care over loyalty in Moral Foundations Theory. Interestingly, we find substantial preference differences in models for some core values. For example, for truthfulness, Mixtral-8x7B neglects it by 9.7% while GPT-4-turbo selects it by 9.4%. We also study the recent guidance released by OpenAI (ModelSpec), and Anthropic (Constitutional AI) to understand how their designated principles reflect their models' actual value prioritization when facing nuanced moral reasoning in daily-life settings. Finally, we find that end users cannot effectively steer such prioritization using system prompts."
Poster,DAMO: Decoding by Accumulating Activations Momentum for Mitigating Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30108,"Kaishen Wang, Hengrui Gu, Meijun Gao, Kaixiong Zhou","Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit significant potential in multimodal tasks but often struggle with hallucinations—responses that are plausible yet visually ungrounded. In this work, we investigate the layer-wise prediction tendencies of VLMs and conduct an in-depth analysis of their decoding mechanism. We observe that VLMs tend to ``overthink'' during the final stages of decoding, making significant prediction shifts in the last few layers often favoring incorrect results, which leads to a surge in hallucinative outputs. Leveraging this localized pattern, we propose a novel decoding strategy inspired by the momentum analogy used in gradient descent-based optimizers. Our method enforces decoding consistency across layers in an adaptive manner during forward passes—an under-explored approach in existing works. This strategy significantly improves the reliability and performance of VLMs in various multimodal tasks, while introducing only negligible efficiency overhead."
Poster,DARE the Extreme: Revisiting Delta-Parameter Pruning For Fine-Tuned Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29137,"Wenlong Deng, Yize Zhao, Vala Vakilian, Minghui Chen, Xiaoxiao Li, Christos Thrampoulidis","Storing open-source fine-tuned models separately introduces redundancy and increases response times in applications utilizing multiple models. Delta-parameter pruning (DPP), particularly the random drop and rescale (DARE) method proposed by Yu et al., addresses this by pruning the majority of delta parameters—the differences between fine-tuned and pre-trained model weights—while typically maintaining minimal performance loss. However, DARE fails when either the pruning rate or the magnitude of the delta parameters is large. We highlight two key reasons for this failure: (1) an excessively large rescaling factor as pruning rates increase, and (2) high mean and variance in the delta parameters. To push DARE’s limits, we introduce DAREx (DARE the eXtreme), which features two algorithmic improvements: (1) DAREx-q, a rescaling factor modification that significantly boosts performance at high pruning rates (e.g., > 30% on COLA and SST2 for encoder models, with even greater gains in decoder models), and (2) DAREx-L2, which combines DARE with AdamR, an in-training method that applies appropriate delta regularization before DPP. We also demonstrate that DAREx-q can be seamlessly combined with vanilla parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA and can facilitate structural DPP. Additionally, we revisit the application of importance-based pruning techniques within DPP, demonstrating that they outperform random-based methods when delta parameters are large. Through this comprehensive study, we develop a pipeline for selecting the most appropriate DPP method under various practical scenarios."
Poster,DarkBench: Benchmarking Dark Patterns in Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28346,"Esben Kran, Hieu Minh Nguyen, Akash Kundu, Sami Jawhar, Jinsuk Park, Mateusz Jurewicz","We introduce DarkBench, a comprehensive benchmark for detecting dark design patterns—manipulative techniques that influence user behavior—in interactions with large language models (LLMs). Our benchmark comprises 660 prompts across six categories: brand bias, user retention, sycophancy, anthropomorphism, harmful generation, and sneaking. We evaluate models from five leading companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Google) and find that some LLMs are explicitly designed to favor their developers' products and exhibit untruthful communication, among other manipulative behaviors. Companies developing LLMs should recognize and mitigate the impact of dark design patterns to promote more ethical Al."
Poster,DartControl: A Diffusion-Based Autoregressive Motion Model for Real-Time Text-Driven Motion Control,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29308,"Kaifeng Zhao, Gen Li, Siyu Tang","Text-conditioned human motion generation, which allows for user interaction through natural language, has become increasingly popular. Existing methods typically generate short, isolated motions based on a single input sentence. However, human motions are continuous and can extend over long periods, carrying rich semantics. Creating long, complex motions that precisely respond to streams of text descriptions, particularly in an online and real-time setting, remains a significant challenge. Furthermore, incorporating spatial constraints into text-conditioned motion generation presents additional challenges, as it requires aligning the motion semantics specified by text descriptions with geometric information, such as goal locations and 3D scene geometry. To address these limitations, we propose **DartC**ontrol, in short **DART**, a **D**iffusion-based **A**utoregressive motion primitive model for **R**eal-time **T**ext-driven motion **C**ontrol. Our model, DART, effectively learns a compact motion primitive space jointly conditioned on motion history and text inputs using latent diffusion models. By autoregressively generating motion primitives based on the preceding history and current text input, DART enables real-time, sequential motion generation driven by natural language descriptions. Additionally,  the learned motion primitive space allows for precise spatial motion control, which we formulate either as a latent noise optimization problem or as a Markov decision process addressed through reinforcement learning. We present effective algorithms for both approaches, demonstrating our model’s versatility and superior performance in various motion synthesis tasks. Experiments show our method outperforms existing baselines in motion realism, efficiency, and controllability. Video results and code are available at https://zkf1997.github.io/DART/."
