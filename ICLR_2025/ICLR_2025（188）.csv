Poster,Learning Mask Invariant Mutual Information for Masked Image Modeling,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29858,"Tao Huang, Yanxiang Ma, Shan You, Chang Xu","Masked autoencoders (MAEs) represent a prominent self-supervised learning paradigm in computer vision. Despite their empirical success, the underlying mechanisms of MAEs remain insufficiently understood. Recent studies have attempted to elucidate the functioning of MAEs through contrastive learning and feature representation analysis, yet these approaches often provide only implicit insights. In this paper, we propose a new perspective for understanding MAEs by leveraging the information bottleneck principle in information theory. Our theoretical analyses reveal that optimizing the latent features to balance relevant and irrelevant information is key to improving MAE performance. Building upon our proofs, we introduce MI-MAE, a novel method that optimizes MAEs through mutual information maximization and minimization. By enhancing latent features to retain maximal relevant information between them and the output, and minimizing irrelevant information between them and the input, our approach achieves better performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that MI-MAE significantly outperforms MAE models in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Our findings validate the theoretical framework and highlight the practical advantages of applying the information bottleneck principle to MAEs, offering deeper insights for developing more powerful self-supervised learning models."
Poster,Learning mirror maps in policy mirror descent,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28430,"Carlo Alfano, Sebastian Towers, Silvia Sapora, Chris Lu, Patrick Rebeschini","Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) is a popular framework in reinforcement learning, serving as a unifying perspective that encompasses numerous algorithms. These algorithms are derived through the selection of a mirror map and enjoy finite-time convergence guarantees. Despite its popularity, the exploration of PMD's full potential is limited, with the majority of research focusing on a particular mirror map---namely, the negative entropy---which gives rise to the renowned Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) method. It remains uncertain from existing theoretical studies whether the choice of mirror map significantly influences PMD's efficacy. In our work, we conduct empirical investigations to show that the conventional mirror map choice (NPG) often yields less-than-optimal outcomes across several standard benchmark environments. Using evolutionary strategies, we identify more efficient mirror maps that enhance the performance of PMD. We first focus on a tabular environment, i.e.\ Grid-World, where we relate existing theoretical bounds with the performance of PMD for a few standard mirror maps and the learned one. We then show that it is possible to learn a mirror map that outperforms the negative entropy in more complex environments, such as the MinAtar suite. Additionally, we demonstrate that the learned mirror maps generalize effectively to different tasks by testing each map across various other environments."
Poster,Learning Molecular Representation in a Cell,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30563,"Gang Liu, Srijit Seal, John Arevalo, Zhenwen Liang, Anne Carpenter, Meng Jiang, Shantanu Singh","Predicting drug efficacy and safety in vivo requires information on biological responses (e.g., cell morphology and gene expression) to small molecule perturbations. However, current molecular representation learning methods do not provide a comprehensive view of cell states under these perturbations and struggle to remove noise, hindering model generalization. We introduce the Information Alignment (InfoAlign) approach to learn molecular representations through the information bottleneck method in cells. We integrate molecules and cellular response data as nodes into a context graph, connecting them with weighted edges based on chemical, biological, and computational criteria. For each molecule in a training batch, InfoAlign optimizes the encoder's latent representation with a minimality objective to discard redundant structural information. A sufficiency objective decodes the representation to align with different feature spaces from the molecule's neighborhood in the context graph. We demonstrate that the proposed sufficiency objective for alignment is tighter than existing encoder-based contrastive methods. Empirically, we validate representations from InfoAlign in two downstream applications: molecular property prediction against up to 27 baseline methods across four datasets, plus zero-shot molecule-morphology matching. The code and model are available at https://github.com/liugangcode/InfoAlign."
Poster,Learning Multi-Index Models with Neural Networks via Mean-Field Langevin Dynamics,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29373,"Alireza Mousavi-Hosseini, Denny Wu, Murat A Erdogdu","We study the problem of learning multi-index models in high-dimensions using a two-layer neural network trained with the mean-field Langevin algorithm. Under mild distributional assumptions on the data, we characterize the effective dimension $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$ that controls both sample and computational complexity by utilizing the adaptivity of neural networks to latent low-dimensional structures. When the data exhibit such a structure, $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$ can be significantly smaller than the ambient dimension. We prove that the sample complexity grows almost linearly with $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$, bypassing the limitations of the information and generative exponents that appeared in recent analyses of gradient-based feature learning. On the other hand, the computational complexity may inevitably grow exponentially with $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$ in the worst-case scenario. Motivated by improving computational complexity, we take the first steps towards polynomial time convergence of the mean-field Langevin algorithm by investigating a setting where the weights are constrained to be on a compact manifold with positive Ricci curvature, such as the hypersphere. There, we study assumptions under which polynomial time convergence is achievable, whereas similar assumptions in the Euclidean setting lead to exponential time complexity."
Poster,Learning multi-modal generative models with permutation-invariant encoders and tighter variational objectives,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31466,"Marcel Hirt, Domenico Campolo, Victoria Leong, Juan-Pablo Ortega","Devising deep latent variable models for multi-modal data has been a long-standing theme in machine learning research. Multi-modal Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been a popular generative model class that learns latent representations that jointly explain multiple modalities. Various objective functions for such models have been suggested, often motivated as lower bounds on the multi-modal data log-likelihood or from information-theoretic considerations. To encode latent variables from different modality subsets, Product-of-Experts (PoE) or Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) aggregation schemes have been routinely used and shown to yield different trade-offs, for instance, regarding their generative quality or consistency across multiple modalities. In this work, we consider a variational objective that can tightly approximate the data log-likelihood. We develop more flexible aggregation schemes that avoid the inductive biases in PoE or MoE approaches by combining encoded features from different modalities based on permutation-invariant neural networks. Our numerical experiments illustrate trade-offs for multi-modal variational objectives and various aggregation schemes. We show that our variational objective and more flexible aggregation models can become beneficial when one wants to approximate the true joint distribution over observed modalities and latent variables in identifiable models."
Poster,Learning Neural Networks with Distribution Shift: Efficiently Certifiable Guarantees,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28915,"Gautam Chandrasekaran, Adam Klivans, Lin Lin Lee, Konstantinos Stavropoulos","We give the first provably efficient algorithms for learning neural networks with respect to distribution shift. We work in the Testable Learning with Distribution Shift  framework (TDS learning) of Klivans et al. (2024), where the learner receives labeled examples from a training distribution and unlabeled examples from a test distribution and must either output a hypothesis with low test error or reject if distribution shift is detected.  No assumptions are made on the test distribution. All prior work in TDS learning focuses on classification, while here we must handle the setting of nonconvex regression. Our results apply to real-valued networks with arbitrary Lipschitz activations and work whenever the training distribution has strictly sub-exponential tails. For training distributions that are bounded and hypercontractive, we give a fully polynomial-time algorithm for TDS learning one hidden-layer networks with sigmoid activations. We achieve this by importing classical kernel methods into the TDS framework using data-dependent feature maps and a type of kernel matrix that couples samples from both train and test distributions."
Poster,Learning on One Mode: Addressing Multi-modality in Offline Reinforcement Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27958,"Mianchu Wang, Yue Jin, Giovanni Montana","Offline reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to learn optimal policies from static datasets without interacting with the environment. A common challenge is handling multi-modal action distributions, where multiple behaviours are represented in the data. Existing methods often assume unimodal behaviour policies, leading to suboptimal performance when this assumption is violated. We propose weighted imitation Learning on One Mode (LOM), a novel approach that focuses on learning from a single, promising mode of the behaviour policy. By using a Gaussian mixture model to identify modes and selecting the best mode based on expected returns, LOM avoids the pitfalls of averaging over conflicting actions. Theoretically, we show that LOM improves performance while maintaining simplicity in policy learning. Empirically, LOM outperforms existing methods on standard D4RL benchmarks and demonstrates its effectiveness in complex, multi-modal scenarios."
Poster,Learning Partial Graph Matching via Optimal Partial Transport,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27991,"Gathika Ratnayaka, James Nichols, Qing Wang","Partial graph matching extends traditional graph matching by allowing some nodes to remain unmatched, enabling applications in more complex scenarios. However, this flexibility introduces additional complexity, as both the subset of nodes to match and the optimal mapping must be determined. While recent studies have explored deep learning techniques for partial graph matching, a significant limitation remains: the absence of an optimization objective that fully captures the problem’s intrinsic nature while enabling efficient solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization framework for partial graph matching, inspired by optimal partial transport. Our approach formulates an objective that enables partial assignments while incorporating matching biases, using weighted total variation as the divergence function to guarantee optimal partial assignments. Our method can achieve efficient, exact solutions within cubic worst case time complexity. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we introduce a novel optimization objective that balances matched and unmatched nodes; (ii) we establish a connection between partial graph matching and linear sum assignment problem, enabling efficient solutions; (iii) we propose a deep graph matching architecture with a novel partial matching loss, providing an end-to-end solution. The empirical evaluations on standard graph matching benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach."
Poster,Learning Randomized Algorithms with Transformers,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29471,"Johannes von Oswald, Seijin Kobayashi, Yassir Akram, Angelika Steger","Randomization is a powerful tool that endows algorithms with remarkable properties. For instance, randomized algorithms excel in adversarial settings, often surpassing the worst-case performance of deterministic algorithms with large margins. Furthermore, their success probability can be amplified by simple strategies such as repetition and majority voting. In this paper, we enhance deep neural networks, in particular transformer models, with randomization. We demonstrate for the first time that randomized algorithms can be instilled in transformers through learning, in a purely data- and objective-driven manner. First, we analyze known adversarial objectives for which randomized algorithms offer a distinct advantage over deterministic ones. We then show that common optimization techniques, such as gradient descent or evolutionary strategies, can effectively learn transformer parameters that make use of the randomness provided to the model. To illustrate the broad applicability of randomization in empowering neural networks, we study three conceptual tasks: associative recall, graph coloring, and agents that explore grid worlds. In addition to demonstrating increased robustness against oblivious adversaries through learned randomization, our experiments reveal remarkable performance improvements due to the inherently random nature of the neural networks' computation and predictions."
Poster,Learning Regularized Graphon Mean-Field Games with Unknown Graphons,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31383,"Fengzhuo Zhang, Vincent Tan, Zhaoran Wang, Zhuoran Yang","We design and analyze reinforcement learning algorithms for Graphon Mean-Field Games (GMFGs). In contrast to previous works that require the precise values of the graphons, we aim to learn the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of the regularized GMFGs when the graphons are unknown. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose the Proximal Policy Optimization for GMFG (GMFG-PPO) algorithm and show that it converges at a rate of $\tilde{O}(T^{-1/3})$ after $T$ iterations with an estimation oracle, improving on a previous work by Xie et al. (ICML, 2021). Second, using kernel embedding of distributions, we design efficient algorithms to estimate the transition kernels, reward functions, and graphons from sampled agents. Convergence rates are then derived when the positions of the agents are either known or unknown. Results for the combination of the optimization algorithm GMFG-PPO and the estimation algorithm are then provided. These algorithms are the first specifically designed for learning graphons from sampled agents. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed algorithms are corroborated through simulations. These simulations demonstrate that learning the unknown graphons  reduces the  exploitability effectively."
