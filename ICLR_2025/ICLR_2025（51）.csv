Poster,CarbonSense: A Multimodal Dataset and Baseline for Carbon Flux Modelling,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28534,"Matthew Fortier, Mats L. Richter, Oliver Sonnentag, Christopher Pal","Terrestrial carbon fluxes provide vital information about our biosphere's health and its capacity to absorb anthropogenic CO$_2$ emissions. The importance of predicting carbon fluxes has led to the emerging field of data-driven carbon flux modelling (DDCFM), which uses statistical techniques to predict carbon fluxes from biophysical data. However, the field lacks a standardized dataset to promote comparisons between models. To address this gap, we present CarbonSense, the first machine learning-ready dataset for DDCFM. CarbonSense integrates measured carbon fluxes, meteorological predictors, and satellite imagery from 385 locations across the globe, offering comprehensive coverage and facilitating robust model training. Additionally, we provide a baseline model using a current state-of-the-art DDCFM approach and a novel transformer based model. Our experiments illustrate the potential gains that multimodal deep learning techniques can bring to this domain. By providing these resources, we aim to lower the barrier to entry for other deep learning researchers to develop new models and drive new advances in carbon flux modelling."
Poster,CARTS: Advancing Neural Theorem Proving with Diversified Tactic Calibration and Bias-Resistant Tree Search,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29413,"Xiao-Wen Yang, Zhi Zhou, Haiming Wang, Aoxue Li, Wen-Da Wei, Hui Jin, Zhenguo Li, Yu-Feng Li","Recent advancements in neural theorem proving integrate large language models with tree search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), where the language model suggests tactics and the tree search finds the complete proof path. However, many tactics proposed by the language model converge to semantically or strategically similar, reducing diversity and increasing search costs by expanding redundant proof paths. This issue exacerbates as computation scales and more tactics are explored per state. Furthermore, the trained value function suffers from false negatives, label imbalance, and domain gaps due to biased data construction.  To address these challenges, we propose CARTS (diversified tactic CAlibration and bias-Resistant Tree Search), which balances tactic diversity and importance while calibrating model confidence. CARTS also introduce preference modeling and an adjustment term related to the ratio of valid tactics to improve the bias-resistance of the value function. Experimental results demonstrate that CARTS consistently outperforms previous methods achieving a pass@l rate of 49.6\% on the miniF2F-test benchmark. Further analysis confirms that CARTS improves tactic diversity and leads to a more balanced tree search."
Poster,CAT-3DGS: A Context-Adaptive Triplane Approach to Rate-Distortion-Optimized 3DGS Compression,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28486,"Yu-Ting Zhan, Cheng-Yuan Ho, He-Bi Yang, Yi-Hsin Chen, Jui Chiu Chiang, Yu-Lun Liu, Wen-Hsiao Peng","3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a promising 3D representation. Much research has been focused on reducing its storage requirements and memory footprint. However, the needs to compress and transmit the 3DGS representation to the remote side are overlooked. This new application calls for rate-distortion-optimized 3DGS compression. How to quantize and entropy encode sparse Gaussian primitives in the 3D space remains largely unexplored. Few early attempts resort to the hyperprior framework from learned image compression. But, they fail to utilize fully the inter and intra correlation inherent in Gaussian primitives. Built on ScaffoldGS, this work, termed CAT-3DGS, introduces a context-adaptive triplane approach to their rate-distortion-optimized coding. It features multi-scale triplanes, oriented according to the principal axes of Gaussian primitives in the 3D space, to capture their inter correlation (i.e. spatial correlation) for spatial autoregressive coding in the projected 2D planes. With these triplanes serving as the hyperprior, we further perform channel-wise autoregressive coding to leverage the intra correlation within each individual Gaussian primitive. Our CAT-3DGS incorporates a view frequency-aware masking mechanism. It actively skips from coding those Gaussian primitives that potentially have little impact on the rendering quality. When trained end-to-end to strike a good rate-distortion trade-off, our CAT-3DGS achieves the state-of-the-art compression performance on the commonly used real-world datasets."
Poster,Catastrophic Failure of LLM Unlearning via Quantization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28528,"Zhiwei Zhang, Fali Wang, Xiaomin Li, Zongyu Wu, Xianfeng Tang, Hui Liu, Qi He, Wenpeng Yin, Suhang Wang","Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in generating text, benefiting from extensive training on vast textual corpora. However, LLMs may also acquire unwanted behaviors from the diverse and sensitive nature of their training data, which can include copyrighted and private content. Machine unlearning has been introduced as a viable solution to remove the influence of such problematic content without the need for costly and time-consuming retraining. This process aims to erase specific knowledge from LLMs while preserving as much model utility as possible. Despite the effectiveness of current unlearning methods, little attention has been given to whether existing unlearning methods for LLMs truly achieve forgetting or merely hide the knowledge, which current unlearning benchmarks fail to detect. This paper reveals that applying quantization to models that have undergone unlearning can restore the ""forgotten"" information. We conduct comprehensive experiments using various quantization techniques across multiple precision levels to thoroughly evaluate this phenomenon. We find that for unlearning methods with utility constraints, the unlearned model retains an average of 21\% of the intended forgotten knowledge in full precision, which significantly increases to 83\% after 4-bit quantization. Based on our empirical findings, we provide a theoretical explanation for the observed phenomenon and propose a quantization-robust unlearning strategy aimed at mitigating this intricate issue. Our results highlight a fundamental tension between preserving the utility of the unlearned model and preventing knowledge recovery through quantization, emphasizing the challenge of balancing these two objectives. Altogether, our study underscores a major failure in existing unlearning methods for LLMs, strongly advocating for more comprehensive and robust strategies to ensure authentic unlearning without compromising model utility.

Poster,CATCH: Channel-Aware Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection via Frequency Patching,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28489,"Xingjian Wu, Xiangfei Qiu, Zhengyu Li, Yihang Wang, Jilin Hu, Chenjuan Guo, Hui Xiong, Bin Yang","Anomaly detection in multivariate time series is challenging as heterogeneous subsequence anomalies may occur. Reconstruction-based methods, which focus on learning normal patterns in the frequency domain to detect diverse abnormal subsequences, achieve promising results, while still falling short on capturing fine-grained frequency characteristics and channel correlations. To contend with the limitations, we introduce CATCH, a framework based on frequency patching. We propose to patchify the frequency domain into frequency bands, which enhances its ability to capture fine-grained frequency characteristics. To perceive appropriate channel correlations, we propose a Channel Fusion Module (CFM), which features a patch-wise mask generator and a masked-attention mechanism. Driven by a bi-level multi-objective optimization algorithm, the CFM is encouraged to iteratively discover appropriate patch-wise channel correlations, and to cluster relevant channels while isolating adverse effects from irrelevant channels. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets and 12 synthetic datasets demonstrate that CATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance. We make our code and datasets available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/CATCH."
Poster,CatVTON: Concatenation Is All You Need for Virtual Try-On with Diffusion Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28612,"Zheng Chong, Xiao Dong, Haoxiang Li, shiyue Zhang, Wenqing Zhang, Hanqing Zhao, xujie zhang, Dongmei Jiang, Xiaodan Liang","Virtual try-on methods based on diffusion models achieve realistic effects but often require additional encoding modules, a large number of training parameters, and complex preprocessing, which increases the burden on training and inference. In this work, we re-evaluate the necessity of additional modules and analyze how to improve training efficiency and reduce redundant steps in the inference process. Based on these insights, we propose CatVTON, a simple and efficient virtual try-on diffusion model that transfers in-shop or worn garments of arbitrary categories to target individuals by concatenating them along spatial dimensions as inputs of the diffusion model. The efficiency of CatVTON is reflected in three aspects: (1) Lightweight network. CatVTON consists only of a VAE and a simplified denoising UNet, removing redundant image and text encoders as well as cross-attentions, and includes just 899.06M parameters. (2) Parameter-efficient training. Through experimental analysis, we identify self-attention modules as crucial for adapting pre-trained diffusion models to the virtual try-on task, enabling high-quality results with only 49.57M training parameters. (3) Simplified inference. CatVTON eliminates unnecessary preprocessing, such as pose estimation, human parsing, and captioning, requiring only a person image and garment reference to guide the virtual try-on process, reducing over 49% memory usage compared to other diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CatVTON achieves superior qualitative and quantitative results compared to baseline methods and demonstrates strong generalization performance in in-the-wild scenarios, despite being trained solely on public datasets with 73K samples."
Poster,Cauchy-Schwarz Regularizers,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30046,"Sueda Taner, Ziyi Wang, Christoph Studer","We introduce a novel class of regularization functions, called Cauchy–Schwarz (CS) regularizers, which can be designed to induce a wide range of properties in solution vectors of optimization problems. To demonstrate the versatility of CS regularizers, we derive regularization functions that promote discrete-valued vectors, eigenvectors of a given matrix, and orthogonal matrices. The resulting CS regularizers are simple, differentiable, and can be free of spurious stationary points, making them suitable for gradient-based solvers and large-scale optimization problems. In addition, CS regularizers automatically adapt to the appropriate scale, which is, for example, beneficial when discretizing the weights of neural networks. To demonstrate the efficacy of CS regularizers, we provide results for solving underdetermined systems of linear equations and weight quantization in neural networks. Furthermore, we discuss specializations, variations, and generalizations, which lead to an even broader class of new and possibly more powerful regularizers."
Poster,Causal Concept Graph Models: Beyond Causal Opacity in Deep Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28500,"Gabriele Dominici, Pietro Barbiero, Mateo Espinosa Zarlenga, Alberto Termine, Martin Gjoreski, Giuseppe Marra, Marc Langheinrich","Causal opacity denotes the difficulty in understanding the ""hidden"" causal structure underlying the decisions of deep neural network (DNN) models. This leads to the inability to rely on and verify state-of-the-art DNN-based systems, especially in high-stakes scenarios. For this reason, circumventing causal opacity in DNNs represents a key open challenge at the intersection of deep learning, interpretability, and causality. This work addresses this gap by introducing Causal Concept Graph Models (Causal CGMs), a class of interpretable models whose decision-making process is causally transparent by design. Our experiments show that Causal CGMs can: (i) match the generalisation performance of causally opaque models, (ii) enable human-in-the-loop corrections to mispredicted intermediate reasoning steps, boosting not just downstream accuracy after corrections but also the reliability of the explanations provided for specific instances, and (iii) support the analysis of interventional and counterfactual scenarios, thereby improving the model's causal interpretability and supporting the effective verification of its reliability and fairness."
Poster,Causal Discovery via Bayesian Optimization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30746,"Bao Duong, Sunil Gupta, Thin Nguyen","Existing score-based methods for directed acyclic graph (DAG) learning from observational data struggle to recover the causal graph accurately and sample-efficiently. To overcome this, in this study, we propose DrBO (DAG recovery via Bayesian Optimization)—a novel DAG learning framework leveraging Bayesian optimization (BO) to find high-scoring DAGs. We show that, by sophisticatedly choosing the promising DAGs to explore, we can find higher-scoring ones much more efficiently. To address the scalability issues of conventional BO in DAG learning, we replace Gaussian Processes commonly employed in BO with dropout neural networks, trained in a continual manner, which allows for (i) flexibly modeling the DAG scores without overfitting, (ii) incorporation of uncertainty into the estimated scores, and (iii) scaling with the number of evaluations. As a result, DrBO is computationally efficient and can find the accurate DAG in fewer trials and less time than existing state-of-the-art methods. This is demonstrated through an extensive set of empirical evaluations on many challenging settings with both synthetic and real data. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/baosws/DrBO."
Poster,Causal Effect Estimation with Mixed Latent Confounders and Post-treatment Variables,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28242,"Yaochen Zhu, Jing Ma, Liang Wu, Qi Guo, Liangjie Hong, Jundong Li","Causal inference from observational data has attracted considerable attention among researchers. One main obstacle is the handling of confounders. As direct measurement of confounders may not be feasible, recent methods seek to address the confounding bias via proxy variables, i.e., covariates postulated to be conducive to the inference of latent confounders. However, the selected proxies may scramble both confounders and post-treatment variables in practice, which risks biasing the estimation by controlling for variables affected by the treatment. In this paper, we systematically investigate the bias due to latent post-treatment variables, i.e., latent post-treatment bias, in causal effect estimation. Specifically, we first derive the bias when selected proxies scramble both latent confounders and post-treatment variables, which we demonstrate can be arbitrarily bad. We then propose a Confounder-identifiable VAE (CiVAE) to address the bias. Based on a mild assumption that the prior of latent variables that generate the proxy belongs to a general exponential family with at least one invertible sufficient statistic in the factorized part, CiVAE individually identifies latent confounders and latent post-treatment variables up to bijective transformations. We then prove that with individual identification, the intractable disentanglement problem of latent confounders and post-treatment variables can be transformed into a tractable independence test problem despite arbitrary dependence may exist among them. Finally, we prove that the true causal effects can be unbiasedly estimated with transformed confounders inferred by CiVAE. Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate significantly improved robustness of CiVAE."
