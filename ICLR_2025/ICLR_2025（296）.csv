Poster,Robust System Identification: Finite-sample Guarantees and Connection to Regularization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29222,"Hank Park, Grani A. Hanasusanto, Yingying Li","We consider the problem of learning nonlinear dynamical systems from a single sample trajectory. While the least squares estimate (LSE) is commonly used for this task, it suffers from poor identification errors when the sample size is small or the model fails to capture the system's true dynamics. To overcome these limitations, we propose a robust LSE framework, which incorporates robust optimization techniques, and prove that it is equivalent to regularizing LSE using general Schatten $p$-norms. We provide non-asymptotic performance guarantees for linear systems, achieving an error rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})$, and show that it avoids the curse of dimensionality, unlike state-of-the-art Wasserstein robust optimization models. Empirical results demonstrate substantial improvements in real-world system identification and online control tasks, outperforming existing methods."
Poster,Robust Transfer of Safety-Constrained Reinforcement Learning Agents,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28164,"Markel Zubia, Thiago Simão, Nils Jansen","Reinforcement learning (RL) often relies on trial and error, which may cause undesirable outcomes. As a result, standard RL is inappropriate for safety-critical applications. To address this issue, one may train a safe agent in a controlled environment (where safety violations are allowed) and then transfer it to the real world (where safety violations may have disastrous consequences). Prior work has made this transfer safe as long as the new environment preserves the safety-related dynamics. However, in most practical applications, differences or shifts in dynamics between the two environments are inevitable, potentially leading to safety violations after the transfer. This work aims to guarantee safety even when the new environment has different (safety-related) dynamics. In other words, we aim to make the process of safe transfer robust. Our methodology (1) robustifies an agent in the controlled environment and (2) provably provides---under mild assumption---a safe transfer to new environments. The empirical evaluation shows that this method yields policies that are robust against changes in dynamics, demonstrating safety after transfer to a new environment."
Poster,Robust Watermarking Using Generative Priors Against Image Editing: From Benchmarking to Advances,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31223,"Shilin Lu, Zihan Zhou, Jiayou Lu, Yuanzhi Zhu, Adams Kong","Current image watermarking methods are vulnerable to advanced image editing techniques enabled by large-scale text-to-image models. These models can distort embedded watermarks during editing, posing significant challenges to copyright protection. In this work, we introduce W-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of watermarking methods against a wide range of image editing techniques, including image regeneration, global editing, local editing, and image-to-video generation. Through extensive evaluations of eleven representative watermarking methods against prevalent editing techniques, we demonstrate that most methods fail to detect watermarks after such edits. To address this limitation, we propose VINE, a watermarking method that significantly enhances robustness against various image editing techniques while maintaining high image quality. Our approach involves two key innovations: (1) we analyze the frequency characteristics of image editing and identify that blurring distortions exhibit similar frequency properties, which allows us to use them as surrogate attacks during training to bolster watermark robustness; (2) we leverage a large-scale pretrained diffusion model SDXL-Turbo, adapting it for the watermarking task to achieve more imperceptible and robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that our method achieves outstanding watermarking performance under various image editing techniques, outperforming existing methods in both image quality and robustness.

Poster,Robust Weight Initialization for Tanh Neural Networks with Fixed Point Analysis,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30383,"Hyunwoo Lee, Hayoung Choi, Hyunju Kim","As a neural network's depth increases, it can improve generalization performance. However, training deep networks is challenging due to gradient and signal propagation issues. To address these challenges, extensive theoretical research and various methods have been introduced. Despite these advances, effective weight initialization methods for tanh neural networks remain insufficiently investigated. This paper presents a novel weight initialization method for neural networks with tanh activation function. Based on an analysis of the fixed points of the function $\tanh(ax)$, the proposed method aims to determine values of $a$ that mitigate activation saturation. A series of experiments on various classification datasets and physics-informed neural networks demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms Xavier initialization methods (with or without normalization) in terms of robustness across different network sizes, data efficiency, and convergence speed.

Poster,RocketEval: Efficient automated LLM evaluation via grading checklist,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27674,"Tianjun Wei, Wei Wen, Ruizhi Qiao, Xing Sun, Jianghong Ma","Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in diverse and challenging scenarios is essential to align them with human preferences. To mitigate the prohibitive costs associated with human evaluations, utilizing a powerful LLM as a judge has emerged as a favored approach. Nevertheless, this methodology encounters several challenges, including substantial expenses, concerns regarding privacy and security, and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose a straightforward, replicable, and accurate automated evaluation method by leveraging a lightweight LLM as the judge, named RocketEval. Initially, we identify that the performance disparity between lightweight and powerful LLMs in evaluation tasks primarily stems from their ability to conduct comprehensive analyses, which is not easily enhanced through techniques such as chain-of-thought reasoning. By reframing the evaluation task as a multi-faceted Q\&A using an instance-specific checklist, we demonstrate that the limited judgment accuracy of lightweight LLMs is largely attributes to high uncertainty and positional bias. To address these challenges, we introduce an automated evaluation process grounded in checklist grading, which is designed to accommodate a variety of scenarios and questions. This process encompasses the creation of checklists, the grading of these checklists by lightweight LLMs, and the reweighting of checklist items to align with the supervised annotations. Our experiments carried out on the automated evaluation benchmarks, MT-Bench and WildBench datasets, reveal that RocketEval, when using $\textit{Gemma-2-2B}$ as the judge, achieves a high correlation (0.965) with human preferences, which is comparable to $\textit{GPT-4o}$. Moreover, RocketEval provides a cost reduction exceeding 50-fold for large-scale evaluation and comparison scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/Joinn99/RocketEval-ICLR."
Poster,Rodimus*: Breaking the Accuracy-Efficiency Trade-Off with Efficient Attentions,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30177,"Zhihao He, Hang Yu, Zi Gong, Shi Zhan Liu, Jianguo Li, Weiyao Lin","Recent advancements in Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have set new standards in natural language processing. However, the classical softmax attention incurs significant computational costs, leading to a $O(T)$ complexity for per-token generation, where $T$ represents the context length. This work explores reducing LLMs' complexity while maintaining performance by introducing Rodimus and its enhanced version, Rodimus$+$. Rodimus employs an innovative data-dependent tempered selection (DDTS) mechanism within a linear attention-based, purely recurrent framework, achieving significant accuracy while drastically reducing the memory usage typically associated with recurrent models. This method exemplifies semantic compression by maintaining essential input information with fixed-size hidden states. Building on this, Rodimus$+$ combines Rodimus with the innovative Sliding Window Shared-Key Attention (SW-SKA) in a hybrid approach, effectively leveraging the complementary semantic, token, and head compression techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that Rodimus$+$-1.6B, trained on 1 trillion tokens, achieves superior downstream performance against models trained on more tokens, including Qwen2-1.5B and RWKV6-1.6B, underscoring its potential to redefine the accuracy-efficiency balance in LLMs. Model code and pre-trained checkpoints are open-sourced at https://github.com/codefuse-ai/rodimus."
Poster,Root Cause Analysis of Anomalies in Multivariate Time Series through Granger Causal Discovery,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28602,"Xiao Han, Saima Absar, Lu Zhang, Shuhan Yuan","Identifying the root causes of anomalies in multivariate time series is challenging due to the complex dependencies among the series. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive approach called AERCA that inherently integrates Granger causal discovery with root cause analysis. By defining anomalies as interventions on the exogenous variables of time series, AERCA not only learns the Granger causality among time series but also explicitly models the distributions of exogenous variables under normal conditions. AERCA then identifies the root causes of anomalies by highlighting exogenous variables that significantly deviate from their normal states. Experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that AERCA can accurately capture the causal relationships among time series and effectively identify the root causes of anomalies."
Poster,Rotated Runtime Smooth: Training-Free Activation Smoother for accurate INT4 inference,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29374,"Ke Yi, Zengke Liu, jianwei zhang, Chengyuan Li, Tong Zhang, Junyang Lin, Jingren Zhou","Large language models have demonstrated promising capabilities upon scaling up parameters. However, serving large language models incurs substantial computation and memory movement costs due to their large scale. Quantization methods have been employed to reduce service costs and latency. Nevertheless, outliers in activations hinder the development of INT4 weight-activation quantization. Existing approaches separate outliers and normal values into two matrices or migrate outliers from activations to weights, suffering from high latency or accuracy degradation. Based on observing activations from large language models, outliers can be classified into channel-wise and spike outliers.In this work, we propose Rotated Runtime Smooth (**RRS**), a plug-and-play activation smoother for quantization, consisting of Runtime Smooth and the Rotation operation. Runtime Smooth (**RS**) is introduced to eliminate **channel-wise outliers** by smoothing activations with channel-wise maximums during runtime. The Rotation operation can narrow the gap between **spike outliers** and normal values, alleviating the effect of victims caused by channel-wise smoothing.The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the LLaMA and Qwen families and improves WikiText-2 perplexity from 57.33 to 6.66 for INT4 inference."
Poster,Round and Round We Go! What makes Rotary Positional Encodings useful?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30251,"Federico Barbero, Alex Vitvitskyi, Christos Perivolaropoulos, Razvan Pascanu, Petar Veličković","Positional Encodings (PEs) are a critical component of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), providing the attention mechanism with important sequence-position information. One of the most popular types of encoding used today in LLMs are Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE), that rotate the queries and keys based on their relative distance. A common belief is that RoPE is useful because it helps to decay token dependency as relative distance increases. In this work, we argue that this is unlikely to be the core reason. We study the internals of a trained Gemma 7B model to understand how RoPE is being used at a mechanical level. We find that Gemma learns to use RoPE to construct robust `positional' attention patterns by exploiting the highest frequencies. We also find that, in general, Gemma greatly prefers to use the lowest frequencies of RoPE, which we suspect are used to carry semantic information. We mathematically prove interesting behaviours of RoPE and conduct experiments to verify our findings, proposing a modification of RoPE that fixes some highlighted issues and improves performance. We believe that this work represents an interesting step in better understanding PEs in LLMs, which we believe holds crucial value for scaling LLMs to large sizes and context lengths."
Poster,RouteLLM: Learning to Route LLMs from Preference Data,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30737,"Isaac Ong, Amjad Almahairi, Vincent Wu, Wei-Lin Chiang, Tianhao Wu, Joseph E Gonzalez, M Kadous, Ion Stoica","Large language models (LLMs) excel at a wide range of tasks, but choosing the right model often involves balancing performance and cost. Powerful models offer better results but are expensive, while smaller models are more cost-effective but less capable. To address this trade-off, we introduce a training framework for learning efficient router models that dynamically select between a stronger and weaker LLM during inference. Our framework leverages human preference data and employs data augmentation techniques to enhance performance. Evaluations on public benchmarks show that our approach can reduce costs by over 2 times without sacrificing response quality. Moreover, our routers exhibit strong generalization capabilities, maintaining performance even when routing between LLMs not included in training. This highlights the potential of our framework to deliver cost-effective, high-performance LLM solutions."
