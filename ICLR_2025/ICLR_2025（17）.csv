Poster,AIR-BENCH 2024: A Safety Benchmark based on Regulation and Policies Specified Risk Categories,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29470,"Yi Zeng, Yu Yang, Andy Zhou, Jeffrey Tan, Yuheng Tu, Yifan Mai, Kevin Klyman, Minzhou Pan, Ruoxi Jia, Dawn Song, Percy Liang, Bo Li","Foundation models (FMs) provide societal benefits but also amplify risks. Governments, companies, and researchers have proposed regulatory frameworks, acceptable use policies, and safety benchmarks in response. However, existing public benchmarks often define safety categories based on previous literature, intuitions, or common sense, leading to disjointed sets of categories for risks specified in recent regulations and policies, which makes it challenging to evaluate and compare FMs across these benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIR-BENCH 2024, the first AI safety benchmark aligned with emerging government regulations and company policies, following the regulation-based safety categories grounded in the AI Risks taxonomy, AIR 2024. AIR 2024 decomposes 8 government regulations and 16 company policies into a four-tiered safety taxonomy with 314 granular risk categories in the lowest tier. AIR-BENCH 2024 contains 5,694 diverse prompts spanning these categories, with manual curation and human auditing to ensure quality. We evaluate leading language models on AIR-BENCH 2024 uncovering insights into their alignment with specified safety concerns. By bridging the gap between public benchmarks and practical AI risks, AIR-BENCH 2024 provides a foundation for assessing model safety across jurisdictions, fostering the development of safer and more responsible AI systems."
Poster,Air Quality Prediction with Physics-Guided Dual Neural ODEs in Open Systems,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28589,"jindong tian, Yuxuan Liang, Ronghui Xu, Peng Chen, Chenjuan Guo, Aoying Zhou, Lujia Pan, Zhongwen Rao, Bin Yang","Air pollution significantly threatens human health and ecosystems, necessitating effective air quality prediction to inform public policy. Traditional approaches are generally categorized into physics-based and data-driven models. Physics-based models usually struggle with high computational demands and closed-system assumptions, while data-driven models may overlook essential physical dynamics, confusing the capturing of spatiotemporal correlations. Although some physics-guided approaches combine the strengths of both models, they often face a mismatch between explicit physical equations and implicit learned representations. To address these challenges, we propose Air-DualODE, a novel physics-guided approach that integrates dual branches of Neural ODEs for air quality prediction. The first branch applies open-system physical equations to capture spatiotemporal dependencies for learning physics dynamics, while the second branch identifies the dependencies not addressed by the first in a fully data-driven way. These dual representations are temporally aligned and fused to enhance prediction accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate that Air-DualODE achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting pollutant concentrations across various spatial scales, thereby offering a promising solution for real-world air quality challenges."
Poster,AI Sandbagging: Language Models can Strategically Underperform on Evaluations,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30824,"Teun van der Weij, Felix Hofstätter, Oliver Jaffe, Samuel Brown, Francis Ward","Trustworthy capability evaluations are crucial for ensuring the safety of AI systems, and are becoming a key component of AI regulation. However, the developers of an AI system, or the AI system itself, may have incentives for evaluations to understate the AI's actual capability. These conflicting interests lead to the problem of *sandbagging* – which we define as *strategic underperformance on an evaluation*. In this paper we assess sandbagging capabilities in contemporary language models (LMs). We prompt frontier LMs, like GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus, to selectively underperform on dangerous capability evaluations, while maintaining performance on general (harmless) capability evaluations. Moreover, we find that models can be fine-tuned, on a synthetic dataset, to hide specific capabilities unless given a password. This behaviour generalizes to high-quality, held-out benchmarks such as WMDP. In addition, we show that both frontier and smaller models can be prompted or password-locked to target specific scores on a capability evaluation. We have mediocre success in password-locking a model to mimic the answers a weaker model would give. Overall, our results suggest that capability evaluations are vulnerable to sandbagging. This vulnerability decreases the trustworthiness of evaluations, and thereby undermines important safety decisions regarding the development and deployment of advanced AI systems.See our code at https://github.com/TeunvdWeij/sandbagging"
Poster,A Large-Scale 3D Face Mesh Video Dataset via Neural Re-parameterized Optimization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31483,"Kim Youwang, Lee Hyun, Kim Sung-Bin, Suekyeong Nam, Janghoon Ju, Tae-Hyun Oh","We propose NeuFace, a 3D face mesh pseudo annotation method on videos via neural re-parameterized optimization. Despite the huge progress in 3D face reconstruction methods, generating reliable 3D face labels for in-the-wild dynamic videos remains challenging. Using NeuFace optimization, we annotate the per-view/-frame accurate and consistent face meshes on large-scale face videos, called the NeuFace-dataset. We investigate how neural re-parameterization helps to reconstruct image-aligned facial details on 3D meshes via gradient analysis. By exploiting the naturalness and diversity of 3D faces in our dataset, we demonstrate the usefulness of our dataset for 3D face-related tasks: improving the reconstruction accuracy of an existing 3D face reconstruction model and learning 3D facial motion prior."
Poster,A Large-scale Dataset and Benchmark for Commuting Origin-Destination Flow Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29354,"Can Rong, Jingtao Ding, Yan Liu, Yong Li","Commuting Origin-Destination~(OD) flows are critical inputs for urban planning and transportation, providing crucial information about the population residing in one region and working in another within an interested area. Due to the high cost of data collection, researchers have developed physical and computational models to generate commuting OD flows using readily available urban attributes, such as sociodemographics and points of interest, for cities lacking historical OD flows \textemdash commuting OD flow generation. Existing works developed models based on different techniques and achieved improvement on different datasets with different evaluation metrics, which hinderes establishing a unified standard for comparing model performance. To bridge this gap, we introduce a large-scale dataset containing commuting OD flows for 3,333 areas including a wide range of urban environments around the United States. Based on that, we benchmark widely used models for commuting OD flow generation. We surprisingly find that the network-based generative models achieve the optimal performance in terms of both precision and generalization ability, which may inspire new research directions of graph generative modeling in this field. The dataset and benchmark are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CommutingODGen-Dataset-0D4C/."
Poster,A Large-scale Training Paradigm for Graph Generative Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29077,"Yu Wang, Ryan Rossi, Namyong Park, Huiyuan Chen, Nesreen Ahmed, Puja Trivedi, Franck Dernoncourt, Danai Koutra, Tyler Derr","Large Generative Models (LGMs) such as GPT, Stable Diffusion, Sora, and Suno are trained on a huge amount of texts, images, videos, and audio that are extremely diverse from numerous domains. This large-scale training paradigm on diverse well-curated data enhances the creativity and diversity of the generated content. However, all previous graph-generative models (e.g., GraphRNN, MDVAE, MoFlow, GDSS, and DiGress) have been trained only on one dataset each time, which cannot replicate the revolutionary success achieved by LGMs in other fields. To remedy this crucial gap, we propose a large-scale training paradigm that uses a large corpus of graphs (over 5000 graphs) from 13 domains, leading to the development of large graph generative models (LGGMs). We empirically demonstrate that the pre-trained LGGMs have superior zero-shot generative capability to existing graph generative models. Furthermore, our pre-trained LGGMs can be easily fine-tuned with graphs from target domains and demonstrate even better performance than those directly trained from scratch, behaving as a solid starting point for real-world customization. Inspired by Stable Diffusion, we further equip LGGMs with the Text-to-Graph generation capability, such as providing the description of the network name and domain (i.e., ""The power-1138-bus graph represents a network of buses in a power distribution system."") and network statistics (i.e., ""The graph has a low average degree, suitable for modeling social media interactions.""). This Text-to-Graph capability integrates the extensive world knowledge in the underlying language model, offering users fine-grained control of the generated graphs. We release the code, the model checkpoint, and the datasets at https://github.com/KINDLab-Fly/LGGM."
Poster,ALBAR: Adversarial Learning approach to mitigate Biases in Action Recognition,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30700,"Joseph Fioresi, Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave, Mubarak Shah","Bias in machine learning models can lead to unfair decision making, and while it has been well-studied in the image and text domains, it remains underexplored in action recognition. Action recognition models often suffer from background bias (i.e., inferring actions based on background cues) and foreground bias (i.e., relying on subject appearance), which can be detrimental to real-life applications such as autonomous vehicles or assisted living monitoring. While prior approaches have mainly focused on mitigating background bias using specialized augmentations, we thoroughly study both foreground and background bias. We propose ALBAR, a novel adversarial training method that mitigates foreground and background biases without requiring specialized knowledge of the bias attributes. Our framework applies an adversarial cross-entropy loss to the sampled static clip (where all the frames are the same) and aims to make its class probabilities uniform using a proposed entropy maximization loss. Additionally, we introduce a gradient penalty loss for regularization against the debiasing process. We evaluate our method on established background and foreground bias protocols, setting a new state-of-the-art and strongly improving combined debiasing performance by over 12% absolute on HMDB51. Furthermore, we identify an issue of background leakage in the existing UCF101 protocol for bias evaluation which provides a shortcut to predict actions and does not provide an accurate measure of the debiasing capability of a model. We address this issue by proposing more fine-grained segmentation boundaries for the actor, where our method also outperforms existing approaches."
Poster,Alchemy: Amplifying Theorem-Proving Capability Through Symbolic Mutation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30827,"Shaonan Wu, Shuai Lu, Yeyun Gong, Nan Duan, Ping Wei","Formal proofs are challenging to write even for experienced experts.  Recent progress in Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) shows promise in expediting this process. However, the formal corpora available on the Internet are limited compared to the general text, posing a significant data scarcity challenge for NTP.   To address this issue, this work proposes Alchemy, a general framework for data synthesis that constructs formal theorems through symbolic mutation. Specifically, for each candidate theorem in Mathlib, we identify all invocable theorems that can be used to rewrite or apply to it. Subsequently, we mutate the candidate theorem by replacing the corresponding term in the statement with its equivalent form or antecedent. As a result, our method increases the number of theorems in Mathlib by an order of magnitude, from 110k to 6M. Furthermore, we perform continual pretraining and supervised finetuning on this augmented corpus for large language models. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a 4.70% absolute performance improvement on Leandojo benchmark. Additionally, our approach achieves a 2.47% absolute performance gain on the out-of-distribution miniF2F benchmark based on the synthetic data. To provide further insights, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of synthetic data composition and the training paradigm, offering valuable guidance for developing a strong theorem prover."
Poster,Algorithmic Stability Based Generalization Bounds for Adversarial Training,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31151,"Runzhi Tian, Yongyi Mao","In this paper, we present a novel stability analysis of adversarial training and prove generalization upper bounds in terms of an expansiveness property of adversarial perturbations used during training and used for evaluation. These expansiveness parameters appear not only govern the vanishing rate of the generalization error but also govern its scaling constant. Our proof techniques do not rely on artificial assumptions of the adversarial loss, as are typically used in previous works. Our bound attributes the robust overfitting in PGD-based adversarial training to the sign function used in the PGD attack, resulting in a bad expansiveness parameter. The peculiar choice of sign function in the PGD attack appears to impact adversarial training both in terms of (inner) optimization and in terms of generalization, as shown in this work. This aspect has been largely overlooked to date. Going beyond the sign-function based PGD attacks, we further show that poor expansiveness properties exist in a wide family of PGD-like iterative attack algorithms, which may highlight an intrinsic difficulty in adversarial training."
Poster,"Aligned Better, Listen Better for Audio-Visual Large Language Models",https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31200,"Yuxin Guo, Shuailei Ma, Shijie Ma, Xiaoyi Bao, Chen-Wei Xie, Kecheng Zheng, Tingyu Weng, Siyang Sun, Yun Zheng, Wei Zou","Audio is essential for multimodal video understanding. On the one hand, video inherently contains audio, which supplies complementary information to vision. Besides, video large language models (Video-LLMs) can encounter many audio-centric settings. However, existing Video-LLMs and Audio-Visual Large Language Models (AV-LLMs) exhibit deficiencies in exploiting audio information, leading to weak understanding and hallucinations. To solve the issues, we delve into the model architecture and dataset. (1) From the architectural perspective, we propose a fine-grained AV-LLM, namely Dolphin. The concurrent alignment of audio and visual modalities in both temporal and spatial dimensions ensures a comprehensive and accurate understanding of videos. Specifically, we devise an audio-visual multi-scale adapter for multi-scale information aggregation, which achieves spatial alignment. For temporal alignment, we propose audio-visual interleaved merging. (2) From the dataset perspective, we curate an audio-visual caption \& instruction-tuning dataset, called AVU. It comprises 5.2 million diverse, open-ended data tuples (video, audio, question, answer) and introduces a novel data partitioning strategy. Extensive experiments show our model not only achieves remarkable performance in audio-visual understanding, but also mitigates potential hallucinations."
