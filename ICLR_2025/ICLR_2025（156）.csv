Poster,How Much is a  Noisy Image Worth? Data Scaling Laws for Ambient Diffusion.,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28244,"Giannis Daras, Yeshwanth Cherapanamjeri, Constantinos C Daskalakis","The quality of generative models depends on the quality of the data they are trained on. Creating large-scale, high-quality datasets is often expensive and sometimes impossible, e.g.~in certain scientific applications where there is no access to clean data due to physical or instrumentation constraints. Ambient Diffusion and related frameworks train diffusion models with solely corrupted data (which are usually cheaper to acquire) but ambient models significantly underperform models trained on clean data. We study this phenomenon at scale by training more than $80$ models on data with different corruption levels across three datasets ranging from $30,000$ to $\approx 1.3$M samples. We show that it is impossible, at these sample sizes, to match the performance of models trained on clean data when only training on noisy data. Yet, a combination of a small set of clean data (e.g.~$10\%$ of the total dataset) and a large set of highly noisy data suffices to reach the performance of models trained solely on similar-size datasets of clean data, and in particular to achieve near state-of-the-art performance. We provide theoretical evidence for our findings by developing novel sample complexity bounds for learning from Gaussian Mixtures with heterogeneous variances. Our theoretical model suggests that, for large enough datasets, the effective marginal utility of a noisy sample is exponentially worse that of a clean sample. Providing a small set of clean samples can significantly reduce the sample size requirements for noisy data, as we also observe in our experiments."
Poster,How Much is Unseen Depends Chiefly on Information About the Seen,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27955,"Seongmin Lee, Marcel Boehme","The *missing mass* refers to the proportion of data points in an *unknown* population of classifier inputs that belong to classes *not* present in the classifier's training data, which is assumed to be a random sample from that unknown population.We find that *in expectation* the missing mass is entirely determined by the number $f_k$ of classes that *do* appear in the training data the same number of times *and an exponentially decaying error*.While this is the first precise characterization of the expected missing mass in terms of the sample, the induced estimator suffers from an impractically high variance. However, our theory suggests a large search space of nearly unbiased estimators that can be searched effectively and efficiently. Hence, we cast distribution-free estimation as an optimization problem to find a distribution-specific estimator with a minimized mean-squared error (MSE), given only the sample.In our experiments, our search algorithm discovers estimators that have a substantially smaller MSE than the state-of-the-art Good-Turing estimator. This holds for over 93\% of runs when there are at least as many samples as classes. Our estimators' MSE is roughly 80\% of the Good-Turing estimator's."
Poster,How much of my dataset did you use? Quantitative Data Usage Inference in Machine Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30403,"Yao Tong, Jiayuan Ye, Sajjad Zarifzadeh, Reza Shokri","How much of my data was used to train a machine learning model? This is a critical question for data owners assessing the risk of unauthorized usage of their data to train models. However, previous work mistakenly treats this as a binary problem—inferring whether all-or-none or any-or-none of the data was used—which is fragile when faced with real, non-binary data usage risks. To address this, we propose a fine-grained analysis called Dataset Usage Cardinality Inference (DUCI), which estimates the exact proportion of data used. Our algorithm, leveraging debiased membership guesses, matches the performance of the optimal MLE approach (with a maximum error <0.1) but with significantly lower (e.g., $300 \times$ less) computational cost."
Poster,How new data permeates LLM knowledge and how to dilute it,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29889,"Chen Sun, Renat Aksitov, Andrey Zhmoginov, Nolan Miller, Max Vladymyrov, Ulrich Rueckert, Been Kim, Mark Sandler","Large language models continually learn through the accumulation of gradient-based updates, but how individual pieces of new information affect existing knowledge, leading to both beneficial generalization and problematic hallucination, remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that when learning new information, LLMs exhibit a ""priming"" effect: learning a new fact can cause the model to inappropriately apply that knowledge in unrelated contexts.To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce ""Outlandish,"" a carefully curated dataset of 1320 diverse text samples designed to probe how new knowledge permeates through an LLM's existing knowledge base. Using this dataset, we show that the degree of priming after learning new information can be predicted by measuring the token probability of key words before training. This relationship holds robustly across different model architectures (PALM-2, Gemma, Llama), sizes, and training stages.Finally, we develop two novel techniques to modulate how new knowledge affects existing model behavior: (1) a ``stepping-stone'' text augmentation strategy and (2) an ``ignore-k'' update pruning method. These approaches reduce undesirable priming effects by 50-95% while preserving the model's ability to learn new information. Our findings provide both empirical insights into how LLMs learn and practical tools for improving the specificity of knowledge insertion in language models.

Poster,How to Evaluate Reward Models for RLHF,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29039,"Evan Frick, Tianle Li, Connor Chen, Wei-Lin Chiang, Anastasios Angelopoulos, Jiantao Jiao, Banghua Zhu, Joseph E Gonzalez, Ion Stoica","We introduce a new benchmark for reward models that quantifies their ability to produce strong language models through RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback).The gold-standard approach is to run a full RLHF training pipeline and directly probe downstream LLM performance.However, this process is prohibitively expensive.To address this, we build a predictive model of downstream LLM performance by evaluating the reward model on proxy tasks. These proxy tasks consist of a large-scale human preference and a verifiable correctness preference dataset, in which we measure 12 metrics across 12 domains.To investigate which reward model metrics are most correlated to gold-standard RLHF outcomes, we launch an end-to-end RLHF experiment on a large-scale crowd-sourced human preference platform to view real reward model downstream performance as ground truth. Ultimately, we compile our data and findings into Preference Proxy Evaluations (PPE), the first reward model benchmark explicitly linked to post-RLHF real-world human preference performance, which we opensource for public use and further development at https://github.com/lmarena/PPE."
Poster,How to Find the Exact Pareto Front for Multi-Objective MDPs?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29630,"Yining Li, Peizhong Ju, Ness Shroff","Multi-Objective Markov Decision Processes (MO-MDPs) are receiving increasing attention, as real-world decision-making problems often involve conflicting objectives that cannot be addressed by a single-objective MDP. The Pareto front identifies the set of policies that cannot be dominated, providing a foundation for finding Pareto optimal solutions that can efficiently adapt to various preferences.However, finding the Pareto front is a highly challenging problem. Most existing methods either (i) rely on traversing the *continuous preference space*, which is impractical and results in approximations that are difficult to evaluate against the true Pareto front, or (ii) focus solely on deterministic Pareto optimal policies, from which there are no known techniques to characterize the full Pareto front. Moreover, finding the structure of the Pareto front itself remains unclear even in the context of dynamic programming, where the MDP is fully known in advance.In this work, we address the challenge of efficiently discovering the Pareto front, involving both deterministic and stochastic Pareto optimal policies.By investigating the geometric structure of the Pareto front in MO-MDPs, we uncover a key property: the Pareto front is on the boundary of a convex polytope whose vertices all correspond to deterministic policies, and neighboring vertices of the Pareto front differ by only one state-action pair of the deterministic policy, almost surely.This insight transforms the global comparison across all policies into a localized search among deterministic policies that differ by only one state-action pair, drastically reducing the complexity of searching for the exact Pareto front. We develop an efficient algorithm that identifies the vertices of the Pareto front by solving a single-objective MDP only once and then traversing the edges of the Pareto front, making it more efficient than existing methods. Furthermore, the entire Pareto front can be found in $V$ iterations, where $V$ represents the number of vertices on the Pareto front.Our empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical strategy in discovering the Pareto front efficiently."
Poster,How to Probe: Simple Yet Effective Techniques for Improving Post-hoc Explanations,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30968,"Siddhartha Gairola, Moritz Böhle, Francesco Locatello, Bernt Schiele","Post-hoc importance attribution methods are a popular tool for “explaining” Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and are inherently based on the assumption that the explanations can be applied independently of how the models were trained. Contrarily, in this work we bring forward empirical evidence that challenges this very notion. Surprisingly, we discover a strong dependency on and demonstrate that the training details of a pre-trained model’s classification layer (<10% of model parameters) play a crucial role, much more than the pre-training scheme itself. This is of high practical relevance: (1) as techniques for pre-training models are becoming increasingly diverse, understanding the interplay between these techniques and attribution methods is critical; (2) it sheds light on an important yet overlooked assumption of post-hoc attribution methods which can drastically impact model explanations and how they are interpreted eventually. With this finding we also present simple yet effective adjustments to the classification layers, that can significantly enhance the quality of model explanations. We validate our findings across several visual pre-training frameworks (fully-supervised, self-supervised, contrastive vision-language training) and analyse how they impact explanations for a wide range of attribution methods on a diverse set of evaluation metrics."
Poster,How to Verify Any (Reasonable) Distribution Property: Computationally Sound Argument Systems for Distributions,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30266,"Tal Herman, Guy Rothblum","As statistical analyses become more central to science, industry and society, there is a growing need to ensure correctness of their results. Approximate correctness can be verified by replicating the entire analysis, but can we verify without replication? We focus on distribution testing problems: verifying that an unknown distribution is close to having a  claimed property. Our main contribution is an interactive protocol between a verifier and an untrusted prover, which can be used to verify any distribution property that can be decided in polynomial time given a full and explicit description of the distribution. If the distribution is at statistical distance $\varepsilon$ from having the property, then the verifier rejects with high probability. This soundness property holds against any polynomial-time  strategy that a cheating prover might follow, assuming the existence of collision-resistant hash functions (a standard assumption in cryptography). For distributions over a domain of size $N$, the protocol consists of $4$ messages and the communication complexity and verifier runtime are roughly $\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{N} / \varepsilon^2 \right)$. The verifier's sample complexity is $\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{N} / \varepsilon^2 \right)$, and this is optimal up to $\text{polylog}(N)$ factors (for any protocol, regardless of its communication complexity). Even for simple properties, approximately deciding whether an unknown distribution has the property can require quasi-linear sample complexity and running time. For any such property, our protocol provides a quadratic speedup over replicating the analysis."
Poster,How to visualize training dynamics in neural networks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31343,"Michael Hu, Shreyans Jain, Sangam Chaulagain, Naomi Saphra",Deep learning practitioners typically rely on training and validation loss curves to understand neural network training dynamics. This blog post demonstrates how classical data analysis tools like PCA and hidden Markov models can reveal how neural networks learn different data subsets and identify distinct training phases. We show that traditional statistical methods remain valuable for understanding the training dynamics of modern deep learning systems.
Poster,"How Two-Layer Neural Networks Learn, One (Giant) Step at a Time",https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31384,"Yatin Dandi, Florent Krzakala, Bruno Loureiro, Luca Pesce, Ludovic Stephan","For high-dimensional Gaussian data, we investigate theoretically how the features of a two-layer neural network adapt to the structure of the target function through a few large batch gradient descent steps, leading to an improvement in the approximation capacity with respect to the initialization.  First, we compare the influence of batch size to that of multiple (but finitely many) steps. For a single gradient step, a batch of size $n = O(d)$ is both necessary and sufficient to align with the target function, although only a single direction can be learned. In contrast, $n = O(d^2)$ is essential for neurons to specialize in multiple relevant directions of the target with a single gradient step. Even in this case, we show there might exist ``hard'' directions requiring $n = O(d^\ell)$ samples to be learned, where $\ell$ is known as the leap index of the target. Second, we show that the picture drastically improves over multiple gradient steps: a batch size of $n = O(d)$ is indeed sufficient to learn multiple target directions satisfying a staircase property, where more and more directions can be learned over time. Finally, we discuss how these directions allow for a drastic improvement in the approximation capacity and generalization error over the initialization, illustrating a separation of scale between the random features/lazy regime and the feature learning regime. Our technical analysis leverages a combination of techniques related to concentration, projection-based conditioning, and Gaussian equivalence, which we believe are of independent interest. By pinning down the conditions necessary for specialization and learning, our results highlight the intertwined role of the structure of the task to learn, the detail of the algorithm (the batch size), and the architecture (i.e., the number of hidden neurons), shedding new light on how neural networks adapt to the feature and learn complex task from data over time."
