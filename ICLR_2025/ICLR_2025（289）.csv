Poster,Rethinking Reward Model Evaluation: Are We Barking up the Wrong Tree?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30496,"xueru wen, Jie Lou, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, XingYu, Xinyu Lu, Ben He, Xianpei Han, Debing Zhang, Le Sun","Reward Models (RMs) are crucial for aligning language models with human preferences. Currently, the evaluation of RMs depends on measuring accuracy against a validation set of manually annotated preference data.Although this method is straightforward and widely adopted, the relationship between RM accuracy and downstream policy performance remains under-explored.In this work, we conduct experiments in a synthetic setting to investigate how differences in RM measured by accuracy translate into gaps in optimized policy performance.Our findings reveal that while there is a weak positive correlation between accuracy and downstream performance, policies optimized towards RMs with similar accuracy can exhibit quite different performance.Moreover, we discover that the way of measuring accuracy significantly impacts its ability to predict the final policy performance. Through the lens of the Regressional Goodhart effect, we recognize that accuracy, when used for measuring RM quality, can fail to fully capture the potential RM overoptimization.This underscores the inadequacy of relying solely on accuracy to reflect their impact on policy optimization."
Poster,Rethinking Reward Modeling in Preference-based Large Language Model Alignment,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28181,"Hao Sun, Yunyi Shen, Jean-Francois Ton","The Bradley-Terry (BT) model is a common and successful practice in reward modeling for Large Language Model (LLM) alignment. However, it remains unclear *why* this model --- originally developed for multi-player stochastic game matching --- can be adopted to convert pairwise response comparisons to reward values and make predictions. Especially given the fact that only a limited number of prompt-response pairs are sparsely compared with others. In this paper, we first establish the convergence rate of BT reward models based on deep neural networks using embeddings, providing a theoretical foundation for their use.Despite theoretically sound, we argue that the BT model is not a necessary choice from the perspective of downstream optimization, this is because a reward model only needs to preserve the correct ranking predictions through a monotonic transformation of the true reward. We highlight the critical concept of *order consistency* in reward modeling and demonstrate that the BT model possesses this property.Moreover, we propose a simple and straightforward upper-bound algorithm, compatible with off-the-shelf binary classifiers, as an alternative order-consistent reward modeling objective. To offer practical insights, we empirically evaluate the performance of these different reward modeling approaches across more than 12,000 experimental setups, using $6$ base LLMs, $2$ datasets, and diverse annotation designs that vary in quantity, quality, and pairing choices in preference annotations."
Poster,Rethinking Self-Distillation: Label Averaging and Enhanced Soft Label Refinement with Partial Labels,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30413,"Hyeonsu Jeong, Hye Won Chung","We investigate the mechanisms of self-distillation in multi-class classification, particularly in the context of linear probing with fixed feature extractors where traditional feature learning explanations do not apply. Our theoretical analysis reveals that multi-round self-distillation effectively performs label averaging among instances with high feature correlations, governed by the eigenvectors of the Gram matrix derived from input features. This process leads to clustered predictions and improved generalization, mitigating the impact of label noise by reducing the model's reliance on potentially corrupted labels. We establish conditions under which multi-round self-distillation achieves 100\% population accuracy despite label noise. Furthermore, we introduce a novel, efficient single-round self-distillation method using refined partial labels from the teacher's top two softmax outputs, referred to as the PLL student model. This approach replicates the benefits of multi-round distillation in a single round, achieving comparable or superior performance--especially in high-noise scenarios--while significantly reducing computational cost."
Poster,Rethinking Shapley Value for Negative Interactions in Non-convex Games,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29127,"Wonjoon Chang, Myeongjin Lee, Jaesik Choi","We study causal interactions for payoff allocation in cooperative game theory, including quantifying feature attribution for deep learning models. Most feature attribution methods mainly stem from the criteria of the Shapley value, which assigns fair payoffs to players based on their expected contribution in a cooperative game. However, interactions between players in the game do not explicitly appear in the original formulation of the Shapley value. In this work, we reformulate the Shapley value to clarify the role of interactions and discuss implicit assumptions from a game-theoretical perspective. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that when negative interactions exist—common in deep learning models—the efficiency axiom can lead to the undervaluation of attributions or payoffs. We suggest a new allocation rule that decomposes contributions into interactions and aggregates positive parts for non-convex games. Furthermore, we propose an approximation algorithm to reduce the cost of interaction computation which can be applied to differentiable functions such as deep learning models. Our approach mitigates counterintuitive attribution outcomes observed in existing methods, ensuring that features critical to a model’s decision receive appropriate attribution."
Poster,Rethinking Spiking Neural Networks from an Ensemble Learning Perspective,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29191,"Yongqi Ding, Lin Zuo, Mengmeng Jing, Pei He, Hanpu Deng","Spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibit superior energy efficiency but suffer from limited performance. In this paper, we consider SNNs as ensembles of temporal subnetworks that share architectures and weights, and highlight a crucial issue that affects their performance: excessive differences in initial states (neuronal membrane potentials) across timesteps lead to unstable subnetwork outputs, resulting in degraded performance. To mitigate this, we promote the consistency of the initial membrane potential distribution and output through membrane potential smoothing and temporally adjacent subnetwork guidance, respectively, to improve overall stability and performance. Moreover, membrane potential smoothing facilitates forward propagation of information and backward propagation of gradients, mitigating the notorious temporal gradient vanishing problem. Our method requires only minimal modification of the spiking neurons without adapting the network structure, making our method generalizable and showing consistent performance gains in 1D speech, 2D object, and 3D point cloud recognition tasks. In particular, on the challenging CIFAR10-DVS dataset, we achieved 83.20\% accuracy with only four timesteps. This provides valuable insights into unleashing the potential of SNNs."
Poster,Rethinking the generalization of drug target affinity prediction algorithms via similarity aware evaluation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28654,"Chenbin Zhang, Zhiqiang Hu, Jiang Chuchu, Wen Chen, JIE XU, Shaoting Zhang","Drug-target binding affinity prediction is a fundamental task for drug discovery. It has been extensively explored in literature and promising results are reported. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that the results may be misleading and cannot be well generalized to real practice. The core observation is that the canonical randomized split of a test set in conventional evaluation leaves the test set dominated by samples with high similarity to the training set. The performance of models is severely degraded on samples with lower similarity to the training set but the drawback is highly overlooked in current evaluation. As a result, the performance can hardly be trusted when the model meets low-similarity samples in real practice. To address this problem, we propose a framework of similarity aware evaluation in which a novel split methodology is proposed to adapt to any desired distribution. This is achieved by a formulation of optimization problems which are approximately and efficiently solved by gradient descent. We perform extensive experiments across five representative methods in four datasets for two typical target evaluations and compare them with various counterpart methods. Results demonstrate that the proposed split methodology can significantly better fit desired distributions and guide the development of models."
Poster,Rethinking the role of frames for SE(3)-invariant crystal structure modeling,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28789,"Yusei Ito, Tatsunori Taniai, Ryo Igarashi, Yoshitaka Ushiku, Kanta Ono","Crystal structure modeling with graph neural networks is essential for various applications in materials informatics, and capturing SE(3)-invariant geometric features is a fundamental requirement for these networks. A straightforward approach is to model with orientation-standardized structures through structure-aligned coordinate systems, or  “frames.” However, unlike molecules, determining frames for crystal structures is challenging due to their infinite and highly symmetric nature. In particular, existing methods rely on a statically fixed frame for each structure, determined solely by its structural information, regardless of the task under consideration. Here, we rethink the role of frames, *questioning whether such simplistic alignment with the structure is sufficient*, and propose the concept of *dynamic frames*. While accommodating the infinite and symmetric nature of crystals, these frames provide each atom with a dynamic view of its local environment, focusing on actively interacting atoms. We demonstrate this concept by utilizing the attention mechanism in a recent transformer-based crystal encoder, resulting in a new architecture called **CrystalFramer**. Extensive experiments show that CrystalFramer outperforms conventional frames and existing crystal encoders in various crystal property prediction tasks."
Poster,Rethinking Visual Counterfactual Explanations Through Region Constraint,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28798,"Bartlomiej Sobieski, Jakub Grzywaczewski, Bartłomiej Sadlej, Matthew Tivnan, Przemyslaw Biecek","Visual counterfactual explanations (VCEs) have recently gained immense popularity as a tool for clarifying the decision-making process of image classifiers. This trend is largely motivated by what these explanations promise to deliver -- indicate semantically meaningful factors that change the classifier's decision. However, we argue that current state-of-the-art approaches lack a crucial component -- the region constraint -- whose absence prevents from drawing explicit conclusions, and may even lead to faulty reasoning due to phenomenons like confirmation bias. To address the issue of previous methods, which modify images in a very entangled and widely dispersed manner, we propose region-constrained VCEs (RVCEs), which assume that only a predefined image region can be modified to influence the model's prediction. To effectively sample from this subclass of VCEs, we propose Region-Constrained Counterfactual Schrödinger Bridge (RCSB), an adaptation of a tractable subclass of Schrödinger Bridges to the problem of conditional inpainting, where the conditioning signal originates from the classifier of interest. In addition to setting a new state-of-the-art by a large margin, we extend RCSB to allow for exact counterfactual reasoning, where the predefined region contains only the factor of interest, and incorporating the user to actively interact with the RVCE by predefining the regions manually."
Poster,Reti-Diff: Illumination Degradation Image Restoration with Retinex-based Latent Diffusion Model,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28550,"Chunming He, Chengyu Fang, Yulun Zhang, Longxiang Tang, Jinfa Huang, Kai Li, zhenhua guo, Xiu Li, Sina Farsiu","Illumination degradation image restoration (IDIR) techniques aim to improve the visibility of degraded images and mitigate the adverse effects of deteriorated illumination. Among these algorithms, diffusion-based models (DM) have shown promising performance but are often burdened by heavy computational demands and pixel misalignment issues when predicting the image-level distribution. To tackle these problems, we propose to leverage DM within a compact latent space to generate concise guidance priors and introduce a novel solution called Reti-Diff for the IDIR task. Specifically, Reti-Diff comprises two significant components: the Retinex-based latent DM (RLDM) and the Retinex-guided transformer (RGformer). RLDM is designed to acquire Retinex knowledge, extracting reflectance and illumination priors to facilitate detailed reconstruction and illumination correction. RGformer subsequently utilizes these compact priors to guide the decomposition of image features into their respective reflectance and illumination components. Following this, RGformer further enhances and consolidates these decomposed features, resulting in the production of refined images with consistent content and robustness to handle complex degradation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Reti-Diff outperforms existing methods on three IDIR tasks, as well as downstream applications."
Poster,Retri3D: 3D Neural Graphics Representation Retrieval,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28267,"Yushi Guan, Daniel Kwan, Jean Dandurand, Xi Yan, Ruofan Liang, Yuxuan Zhang, Nilesh Jain, Nilesh Ahuja, Selvakumar Panneer, Nandita Vijaykumar","Learnable 3D Neural Graphics Representations (3DNGR) have emerged as promising 3D representations for reconstructing 3D scenes from 2D images. Numerous works, including Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), and their variants, have significantly enhanced the quality of these representations. The ease of construction from 2D images, suitability for online viewing/sharing, and applications in game/art design downstream tasks make it a vital 3D representation, with potential creation of large numbers of such 3D models. This necessitates large data stores, local or online, to save 3D visual data in these formats. However, no existing framework enables accurate retrieval of stored 3DNGRs. In this work, we propose, Retri3D, a framework that enables accurate and efficient retrieval of 3D scenes represented as NGRs from large data stores using text queries. We introduce a novel Neural Field Artifact Analysis technique, combined with a Smart Camera Movement Module, to select clean views and navigate pre-trained 3DNGRs. These techniques enable accurate retrieval by selecting the best viewing directions in the 3D scene for high-quality visual feature embeddings. We demonstrate that Retri3D is compatible with any NGR representation. On the LERF and ScanNet++ datasets, we show significant improvement in retrieval accuracy compared to existing techniques, while being orders of magnitude faster and storage efficient."
