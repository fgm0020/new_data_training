Poster,What Secrets Do Your Manifolds Hold? Understanding the Local Geometry of Generative Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28903,"Ahmed Imtiaz Humayun, Ibtihel Amara, Cristina Nader Vasconcelos, Deepak Ramachandran, Candice Schumann, Junfeng He, Katherine Heller, Golnoosh Farnadi, Negar Rostamzadeh, Mohammad Havaei","Deep Generative Models are frequently used to learn continuous representations of complex data distributions by training on a finite number of samples. For any generative model, including pre-trained foundation models with Diffusion or Transformer architectures, generation performance can significantly vary across the learned data manifold. In this paper, we study the local geometry of the learned manifold and its relationship to generation outcomes for a wide range of generative models, including DDPM, Diffusion Transformer (DiT), and Stable Diffusion 1.4. Building on the theory of continuous piecewise-linear (CPWL) generators, we characterize the local geometry in terms of three geometric descriptors - scaling ($\psi$), rank ($\nu$), and complexity/un-smoothness ($\delta$). We provide quantitative and qualitative evidence showing that for a given latent vector, the local descriptors are indicative of post-generation aesthetics, generation diversity, and memorization by the generative model. Finally, we demonstrate that by training a reward model on the 'local scaling' for Stable Diffusion, we can self-improve both generation aesthetics and diversity using geometry sensitive guidance during denoising.

Poster,What should a neuron aim for? Designing local objective functions based on information theory,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30518,"Andreas C. Schneider, Valentin Neuhaus, David Ehrlich, Abdullah Makkeh, Alexander S Ecker, Viola Priesemann, Michael Wibral","In modern deep neural networks, the learning dynamics of individual neurons are often obscure, as the networks are trained via global optimization. Conversely, biological systems build on self-organized, local learning, achieving robustness and efficiency with limited global information. Here, we show how self-organization between individual artificial neurons can be achieved by designing abstract bio-inspired local learning goals. These goals are parameterized using a recent extension of information theory, Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes the information that a set of information sources holds about an outcome into unique, redundant and synergistic contributions. Our framework enables neurons to locally shape the integration of information from various input classes, i.e., feedforward, feedback, and lateral, by selecting which of the three inputs should contribute uniquely, redundantly or synergistically to the output. This selection is expressed as a weighted sum of PID terms, which, for a given problem, can be directly derived from intuitive reasoning or via numerical optimization, offering a window into understanding task-relevant local information processing. Achieving neuron-level interpretability while enabling strong performance using local learning, our work advances a principled information-theoretic foundation for local learning strategies."
Poster,What's New in My Data? Novelty Exploration via Contrastive Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30165,"Masaru Isonuma, Ivan Titov","Fine-tuning is widely used to adapt language models for specific goals, often leveraging real-world data such as patient records, customer-service interactions, or web content in languages not covered in pre-training.These datasets are typically massive, noisy, and often confidential, making their direct inspection challenging.However, understanding them is essential for guiding model deployment and informing decisions about data cleaning or suppressing any harmful behaviors learned during fine-tuning.In this study, we introduce the task of novelty discovery through generation, which aims to identify novel domains of a fine-tuning dataset by generating examples that illustrate these properties.Our approach － Contrastive Generative Exploration (CGE) － assumes no direct access to the data but instead relies on a pre-trained model and the same model after fine-tuning.By contrasting the predictions of these two models, CGE can generate examples that highlight novel domains of the fine-tuning data.However, this simple approach may produce examples that are too similar to one another, failing to capture the full range of novel domains present in the dataset.We address this by introducing an iterative version of CGE, where the previously generated examples are used to update the pre-trained model, and this updated model is then contrasted with the fully fine-tuned model to generate the next example, promoting diversity in the generated outputs.Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CGE in detecting novel domains, such as toxic language, as well as new natural and programming languages.Furthermore, we show that CGE remains effective even when models are fine-tuned using differential privacy techniques."
Poster,What's the Move? Hybrid Imitation Learning via Salient Points,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28225,"Priya Sundaresan, Hengyuan Hu, Quan Vuong, Jeannette Bohg, Dorsa Sadigh","While imitation learning (IL) offers a promising framework for teaching robots various behaviors, learning complex tasks remains challenging. Existing IL policies struggle to generalize effectively across visual and spatial variations even for simple tasks. In this work, we introduce **SPHINX**: **S**alient **P**oint-based **H**ybrid **I**mitatio**N** and e**X**ecution, a flexible IL policy that leverages multimodal observations (point clouds and wrist images), along with a hybrid action space of low-frequency, sparse waypoints and high-frequency, dense end effector movements. Given 3D point cloud observations, SPHINX learns to infer task-relevant points within a point cloud, or *salient points*, which support spatial generalization by focusing on semantically meaningful features. These salient points serve as anchor points to predict waypoints for long-range movement, such as reaching target poses in free-space. Once near a salient point, SPHINX learns to switch to predicting dense end-effector movements given close-up wrist images for precise phases of a task. By exploiting the strengths of different input modalities and action representations for different manipulation phases, SPHINX tackles complex tasks in a sample-efficient, generalizable manner. Our method achieves **86.7%**  success across 4 real-world and 2 simulated tasks, outperforming the next best state-of-the-art IL baseline by **41.1%** on average across **440** real world trials. SPHINX additionally generalizes to novel viewpoints, visual distractors, spatial arrangements, and execution speeds with a **1.7x** speedup over the most competitive baseline. Our website (http://sphinx-manip.github.io) provides open-sourced code for data collection, training, and evaluation, along with supplementary videos."
Poster,What to align in multimodal contrastive learning?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29742,"Benoit Dufumier, Javiera Castillo Navarro, Devis Tuia, Jean-Philippe Thiran","Humans perceive the world through multisensory integration, blending the information of different modalities to adapt their behavior.Contrastive learning offers an appealing solution for multimodal self-supervised learning. Indeed, by considering each modality as a different view of the same entity, it learns to align features of different modalities in a shared representation space. However, this approach is intrinsically limited as it only learns shared or redundant information between modalities, while multimodal interactions can arise in other ways. In this work, we introduce CoMM, a Contrastive Multimodal learning strategy that enables the communication between modalities in a single multimodal space. Instead of imposing cross- or intra- modality constraints, we propose to align multimodal representations by maximizing the mutual information between augmented versions of these multimodal features. Our theoretical analysis shows that shared, synergistic and unique terms of information naturally emerge from this formulation, allowing us to estimate multimodal interactions beyond redundancy. We test CoMM both in a controlled and in a series of real-world settings: in the former, we demonstrate that CoMM effectively captures redundant, unique and synergistic information between modalities. In the latter, CoMM learns complex multimodal interactions and achieves state-of-the-art results on seven multimodal tasks."
Poster,When Attention Sink Emerges in Language Models: An Empirical View,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30847,"Xiangming Gu, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Qian Liu, Fengzhuo Zhang, Cunxiao Du, Ye Wang, Min Lin","Auto-regressive language Models (LMs) assign significant attention to the first token, even if it is not semantically important, which is known as **attention sink**. This phenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long context generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model quantization, and others.  Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of attention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that attention sinks exist universally in auto-regressive LMs with various inputs, even in small models. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM pre-training, motivating us to investigate how *optimization*, *data distribution*, *loss function*, and *model architecture* in LM pre-training influence its emergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effective optimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highly correlated with the loss function and data distribution. Most importantly, we find that attention sink acts more like key biases, *storing extra attention scores*, which could be non-informative and not contribute to the value computation. We also observe that this phenomenon (at least partially) stems from tokens' inner dependence on attention scores as a result of softmax normalization. After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attention with other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without normalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Attention-Sink."
Poster,When does compositional structure yield compositional generalization? A kernel theory.,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30345,"Samuel Lippl, Kimberly Stachenfeld","Compositional generalization (the ability to respond correctly to novel combinations of familiar components) is thought to be a cornerstone of intelligent behavior. Compositionally structured (e.g. disentangled) representations support this ability; however, the conditions under which they are sufficient for the emergence of compositional generalization remain unclear. To address this gap, we present a theory of compositional generalization in kernel models with fixed, compositionally structured representations. This provides a tractable framework for characterizing the impact of training data statistics on generalization. We find that these models are limited to functions that assign values to each combination of components seen during training, and then sum up these values (""conjunction-wise additivity""). This imposes fundamental restrictions on the set of tasks compositionally structured kernel models can learn, in particular preventing them from transitively generalizing equivalence relations. Even for compositional tasks that they can learn in principle, we identify novel failure modes in compositional generalization (memorization leak and shortcut bias) that arise from biases in the training data. Finally, we empirically validate our theory, showing that it captures the behavior of deep neural networks (convolutional networks, residual networks, and Vision Transformers) trained on a set of compositional tasks with similarly structured data. Ultimately, this work examines how statistical structure in the training data can affect compositional generalization, with implications for how to identify and remedy failure modes in deep learning models."
Poster,When do GFlowNets learn the right distribution?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30708,"Tiago Silva, Rodrigo Alves, Eliezer de Souza da Silva, Amauri Souza, Vikas Garg, Samuel Kaski, Diego Mesquita","Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are an emerging class of sampling methods for distributions over discrete and compositional objects, e.g., graphs. In spite of their remarkable success in problems such as drug discovery and phylogenetic inference, the question of when and whether GFlowNets learn to sample from the target distribution remains underexplored. To tackle this issue, we first assess the extent to which a violation of the detailed balance of the underlying flow network might hamper the correctness of GFlowNet's sampling distribution. In particular, we demonstrate that the impact of an imbalanced edge on the model's accuracy is influenced by the total amount of flow passing through it and, as a consequence, is unevenly distributed across the network. We also argue that, depending on the parameterization, imbalance may be inevitable. In this regard, we consider the problem of sampling from distributions over graphs with GFlowNets parameterized by graph neural networks (GNNs) and show that the representation limits of GNNs delineate which distributions these GFlowNets can approximate. Lastly, we address these limitations by proposing a theoretically sound and computationally tractable metric for assessing GFlowNets, experimentally showing it is a better proxy for correctness than popular evaluation protocols."
Poster,When GNNs meet symmetry in ILPs: an orbit-based feature augmentation approach,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27839,"Qian Chen, Lei Li, Qian Li, Jianghua Wu, Akang Wang, Ruoyu Sun, Xiaodong Luo, Tsung-Hui Chang, Qingjiang Shi","A common characteristic in integer linear programs (ILPs) is symmetry, allowing variables to be permuted without altering the underlying problem structure. Recently, GNNs have emerged as a promising approach for solving ILPs. However, a significant challenge arises when applying GNNs to ILPs with symmetry: classic GNN architectures struggle to differentiate between symmetric variables, which limits their predictive accuracy. In this work, we investigate the properties of permutation equivalence and invariance in GNNs, particularly in relation to the inherent symmetry of ILP formulations. We reveal that the interaction between these two factors contributes to the difficulty of distinguishing between symmetric variables.To address this challenge, we explore the potential of feature augmentation and propose several guiding principles for constructing augmented features. Building on these principles, we develop an orbit-based augmentation scheme that first groups symmetric variables and then samples augmented features for each group from a discrete uniform distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly enhances both training efficiency and predictive performance."
Poster,When Graph Neural Networks Meet Dynamic Mode Decomposition,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28958,"Dai Shi, Lequan Lin, Andi Han, Zhiyong Wang, Yi Guo, Junbin Gao","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as fundamental tools for a wide range of prediction tasks on graph-structured data. Recent studies have drawn analogies between GNN feature propagation and diffusion processes, which can be interpreted as dynamical systems. In this paper, we delve deeper into this perspective by connecting the dynamics in GNNs to modern Koopman theory and its numerical method, Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). We illustrate how DMD can estimate a low-rank, finite-dimensional linear operator based on multiple states of the system, effectively approximating potential nonlinear interactions between nodes in the graph. This approach allows us to capture complex dynamics within the graph accurately and efficiently. We theoretically establish a connection between the DMD-estimated operator and the original dynamic operator between system states. Building upon this foundation, we introduce a family of DMD-GNN models that effectively leverage the low-rank eigenfunctions provided by the DMD algorithm. We further discuss the potential of enhancing our approach by incorporating domain-specific constraints such as symmetry into the DMD computation, allowing the corresponding GNN models to respect known physical properties of the underlying system. Our work paves the path for applying advanced dynamical system analysis tools via GNNs. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on various learning tasks, including directed graphs, large-scale graphs, long-range interactions, and spatial-temporal graphs. We also empirically verify that our proposed models can serve as powerful encoders for link prediction tasks. The results demonstrate that our DMD-enhanced GNNs achieve state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating DMD into GNN frameworks."
