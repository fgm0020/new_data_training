Poster,Topological Blindspots: Understanding and Extending Topological Deep Learning Through the Lens of Expressivity,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30372,"Yam Eitan, Yoav Gelberg, Guy Bar-Shalom, Fabrizio Frasca, Michael Bronstein, Haggai Maron","Topological deep learning (TDL) is a rapidly growing field that seeks to leverage topological structure in data and facilitate learning from data supported on topological objects, ranging from molecules to 3D shapes. Most TDL architectures can be unified under the framework of higher-order message-passing (HOMP), which generalizes graph message-passing to higher-order domains. In the first part of the paper, we explore HOMP's expressive power from a topological perspective, demonstrating the framework's inability to capture fundamental topological and metric invariants such as diameter, orientability, planarity, and homology. In addition, we demonstrate HOMP's limitations in fully leveraging lifting and pooling methods on graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study the expressivity of TDL from a topological perspective. In the second part of the paper, we develop two new classes of architectures -- multi-cellular networks (MCN) and scalable MCN (SMCN) -- which draw inspiration from expressive GNNs. MCN can reach full expressivity, but scaling it to large data objects can be computationally expansive. Designed as a more scalable alternative, SMCN still mitigates many of HOMP's expressivity limitations. Finally, we design new benchmarks for evaluating models based on their ability to learn topological properties of complexes. We then evaluate SMCN on these benchmarks as well as on real-world graph datasets, demonstrating improvements over both HOMP baselines and expressive graph methods, highlighting the value of expressively leveraging topological information."
Poster,Topological Schrödinger Bridge Matching,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29332,Maosheng Yang,"Given two boundary distributions, the \emph{Schrödinger Bridge} (SB) problem seeks the “most likely” random evolution between them with respect to a reference process. It has revealed rich connections to recent machine learning methods for generative modeling and distribution matching. While these methods perform well in Euclidean domains, they are not directly applicable to topological domains such as graphs and simplicial complexes, which are crucial for data defined over network entities, such as node signals and edge flows. In this work, we propose the \emph{Topological Schrödinger Bridge problem} ($\mathcal{T}$SBP) for matching signal distributions on a topological domain. We set the reference process to follow some linear tractable \emph{topology-aware} stochastic dynamics such as topological heat diffusion. For the case of Gaussian boundary distributions, we derive a \emph{closed-form} topological SB ($\mathcal{T}$SB) in terms of its time-marginal and stochastic differential. In the general case, leveraging the well-known result, we show that the optimal process follows the forward-backward topological dynamics governed by some unknowns. Building on these results, we develop $\mathcal{T}$SB-based models for matching topological signals by parameterizing the unknowns in the optimal process as \emph{(topological) neural networks} and learning them through \emph{likelihood training}. We validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the practical applications of $\mathcal{T}$SB-based models on both synthetic and real-world networks, emphasizing the role of topology. Additionally, we discuss the connections of $\mathcal{T}$SB-based models to other emerging models, and outline future directions for topological signal matching."
Poster,Topological Zigzag Spaghetti for Diffusion-based Generation and Prediction on Graphs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28459,"Yuzhou Chen, Yulia Gel","Diffusion models have recently emerged as a new powerful machinery for generative artificial intelligence on graphs, with applications ranging from drug design to knowledge discovery. However, despite their high potential, most, if not all, existing graph diffusion models are limited in their ability to holistically describe the intrinsic higher-order topological graph properties, which obstructs model generalizability and adoption for downstream tasks. We address this fundamental challenge and extract the latent salient topological graph descriptors at different resolutions by leveraging zigzag persistence. We develop a new computationally efficient topological summary,zigzag spaghetti (ZS), which delivers the most inherent topological properties simultaneously over a sequence of graphs at multiple resolutions. We derive theoretical stability guarantees of ZS and present the first attempt to integratedynamic topological information into graph diffusion models. Our extensive experiments on graph classification and prediction tasks suggest that ZS has a high promise not only to enhance performance of graph diffusion models, with gains up 10\%, but also to substantially booster model robustness."
Poster,TopoNets: High performing vision and language models with brain-like topography,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29552,"Mayukh Deb, Mainak Deb, Apurva Murty","Neurons in the brain are organized such that nearby cells tend to share similar functions. AI models lack this organization, and past efforts to introduce topography have often led to trade-offs between topography and task performance. In this work, we present *TopoLoss*, a new loss function that promotes spatially organized topographic representations in AI models without significantly sacrificing task performance. TopoLoss is highly adaptable and can be seamlessly integrated into the training of leading model architectures. We validate our method on both vision (ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ViT) and language models (GPT-Neo-125M, NanoGPT), collectively *TopoNets*. TopoNets are the highest performing supervised topographic models to date, exhibiting brain-like properties such as localized feature processing, lower dimensionality, and increased efficiency. TopoNets also predict responses in the brain and replicate the key topographic signatures observed in the brain’s visual and language cortices, further bridging the gap between biological and artificial systems. This work establishes a robust and generalizable framework for integrating topography into AI, advancing the development of high performing models that more closely emulate the computational strategies of the human brain.

Poster,TorchTitan: One-stop PyTorch native solution for production ready LLM pretraining,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29620,"Wanchao Liang, Tianyu Liu, Less Wright, Will Constable, Andrew Gu, Chien-Chin Huang, Iris Zhang, Wei Feng, Howard Huang, Junjie Wang, Sanket Jayant Purandare, Gokul Nadathur, Stratos Idreos","The development of large language models (LLMs) has been instrumental in advancing state-of-the-art natural language processing applications. Training LLMs with billions of parameters and trillions of tokens requires sophisticated distributed systems that enable composing and comparing several state-of-the-art techniques in order to efficiently scale across thousands of accelerators. However, existing solutions are complex, scattered across multiple libraries/repositories, lack interoperability, and are cumbersome to maintain. Thus, curating and empirically comparing training recipes requires non-trivial engineering effort.This paper introduces **TORCHTITAN**$^1$, a PyTorch-native distributed training system that unifies and advances state-of-the-art techniques, streamlining integration and reducing engineering overhead. TORCHTITAN enables seamless application of 4D parallelism in a modular and composable manner, while featuring elastic scaling to adapt to changing computational requirements. The system provides comprehensive logging, efficient checkpointing, and debugging tools, ensuring production-ready training. Moreover, TORCHTITAN incorporates innovative hardware-software co-designed solutions, leveraging cutting-edge features like Float8 training and SymmetricMemory to maximize hardware utilization.As a flexible experimental test bed, TORCHTITAN facilitates the curation and comparison of custom recipes for diverse training contexts. By leveraging TORCHTITAN, we developed optimized training recipes for the Llama 3.1 family and provide actionable guidance on selecting and combining distributed training techniques to maximize training efficiency, based on our hands-on experiences.We thoroughly assess TORCHTITAN on the Llama 3.1 family of LLMs, spanning 8 billion to 405 billion parameters, and showcase its exceptional performance, modular composability, and elastic scalability. By stacking training optimizations, we demonstrate accelerations ranging from 65.08% on Llama 3.1 8B at 128 GPU scale (1D), 12.59% on Llama 3.1 70B at 256 GPU scale (2D), to 30% on Llama 3.1 405B at 512 GPU scale (3D) on NVIDIA H100 GPUs over optimized baselines. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of 4D parallelism in enabling long context training.$^1$ GitHub: [https://github.com/pytorch/torchtitan](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtitan)"
Poster,To Tackle Adversarial Transferability: A Novel Ensemble Training Method with Fourier Transformation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30054,"Wanlin Zhang, Weichen Lin, Ruomin Huang, Shihong Song, Hu Ding","Ensemble methods are commonly used for enhancing robustness in machine learning. However, due to the ''transferability'' of adversarial examples, the performance of an ensemble model can be seriously affected even it contains a set of independently trained sub-models. To address this issue, we propose an efficient data transformation method based on a cute  ''weakness allocation'' strategy, to diversify non-robust features.Our approach relies on a fine-grained analysis on the relation between non-robust features and adversarial attack directions.Moreover, our approach enjoys several other advantages, e.g., it does  not require any communication between sub-models and the construction complexity is also quite low.We  conduct a set of  experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed method and compare it with several popular baselines. The  results suggest that our approach can achieve significantly improved robust accuracy over most existing ensemble methods, and meanwhile preserve high clean accuracy."
Poster,To Trust or Not to Trust? Enhancing Large Language Models' Situated Faithfulness to External Contexts,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30079,"Yukun Huang, Sanxing Chen, Hongyi Cai, Bhuwan Dhingra","Large Language Models (LLMs) are often augmented with external contexts, such as those used in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, these contexts can be inaccurate or intentionally misleading, leading to conflicts with the model’s internal knowledge. We argue that robust LLMs should demonstrate situated faithfulness, dynamically calibrating their trust in external information based on their confidence in the internal knowledge and the external context to resolve knowledge conflicts. To benchmark this capability, we evaluate LLMs across several QA datasets, including a newly created dataset featuring in-the-wild incorrect contexts sourced from Reddit posts. We show that when provided with both correct and incorrect contexts, both open-source and proprietary models tend to overly rely on external information, regardless of its factual accuracy. To enhance situated faithfulness, we propose two approaches: Self-Guided Confidence Reasoning (SCR) and Rule-Based Confidence Reasoning (RCR). SCR enables models to self-access the confidence of external information relative to their own internal knowledge to produce the most accurate answer. RCR, in contrast, extracts explicit confidence signals from the LLM and determines the final answer using predefined rules. Our results show that for LLMs with strong reasoning capabilities, such as GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, SCR outperforms RCR, achieving improvements of up to 24.2\% over a direct input augmentation baseline. Conversely, for a smaller model like Llama-3-8B, RCR outperforms SCR. Fine-tuning SCR with our proposed Confidence Reasoning Direct Preference Optimization (CR-DPO) method improves performance on both seen and unseen datasets, yielding an average improvement of 8.9\% on Llama-3-8B. In addition to quantitative results, we offer insights into the relative strengths of SCR and RCR. Our findings highlight promising avenues for improving situated faithfulness in LLMs."
Poster,ToVE: Efficient Vision-Language Learning via Knowledge Transfer from Vision Experts,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30410,"Yuanchen Wu, Junlong Du, Ke Yan, Shouhong Ding, Xiaoqiang Li","Vision-language (VL) learning requires extensive visual perception capabilities, such as fine-grained object recognition and spatial perception. Recent works typically rely on training huge models on massive datasets to develop these capabilities. As a more efficient alternative, this paper proposes a new framework that Transfers the knowledge from a hub of Vision Experts (ToVE) for efficient VL learning, leveraging pre-trained vision expert models to promote visual perception capability. Specifically, building on a frozen CLIP image encoder that provides vision tokens for image-conditioned language generation, ToVE introduces a hub of multiple vision experts and a token-aware gating network that dynamically routes expert knowledge to vision tokens. In the transfer phase, we propose a ""residual knowledge transfer"" strategy, which not only preserves the generalizability of the vision tokens but also allows selective detachment of low-contributing experts to improve inference efficiency. Further, we explore to merge these expert knowledge to a single CLIP encoder, creating a knowledge-merged CLIP that produces more informative vision tokens without expert inference during deployment. Experiment results across various VL tasks demonstrate that the proposed ToVE achieves competitive performance with two orders of magnitude fewer training data."
Poster,Toward Efficient Multi-Agent Exploration With Trajectory Entropy Maximization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29242,"Tianxu Li, Kun Zhu","Recent works have increasingly focused on learning decentralized policies for agents as a solution to the scalability challenges in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), where agents typically share the parameters of a policy network to make action decisions. However, this parameter sharing can impede efficient exploration, as it may lead to similar behaviors among agents. Different from previous mutual information-based methods that promote multi-agent diversity, we introduce a novel multi-agent exploration method called Trajectory Entropy Exploration (TEE). Our method employs a particle-based entropy estimator to maximize the entropy of different agents' trajectories in a contrastive trajectory representation space, resulting in diverse trajectories and efficient exploration. This entropy estimator avoids challenging density modeling and scales effectively in high-dimensional multi-agent settings. We integrate our method with MARL algorithms by deploying an intrinsic reward for each agent to encourage entropy maximization. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we test our method in challenging multi-agent tasks from several MARL benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."
Poster,Toward Exploratory Inverse Constraint Inference with Generative Diffusion Verifiers,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31251,"Runyi Zhao, Sheng Xu, Bo Yue, Guiliang Liu","An important prerequisite for safe control is aligning the policy with the underlying constraints in the environment. In many real-world applications, due to the difficulty of manually specifying these constraints, existing works have proposed recovering constraints from expert demonstrations by solving the Inverse Constraint Learning (ICL) problem. However, ICL is inherently ill-posed, as multiple constraints can equivalently explain the experts' preferences, making the optimal solutions not uniquely identifiable. In this work, instead of focusing solely on a single constraint, we propose the novel approach of Exploratory ICL (ExICL). The goal of ExICL is to recover a diverse set of feasible constraints, thereby providing practitioners the flexibility to select the most appropriate constraint based on the practical needs of deployment. To achieve this goal, we design a generative diffusion verifier that guides the trajectory generation process using the probabilistic representation of an optimal constrained policy. By comparing these decisions with those made by expert agents, we can efficiently verify a candidate constraint. Driven by the verification feedback, ExICL implements an exploratory constraint update mechanism that strategically facilitates diversity within the collection of feasible constraints. Our empirical results demonstrate that ExICL can seamlessly and reliably generalize across different tasks and environments. The code is available at https://github.com/ZhaoRunyi/ExICL."
