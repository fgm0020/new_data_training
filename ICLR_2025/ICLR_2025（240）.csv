Poster,ObscuraCoder: Powering Efficient Code LM Pre-Training Via Obfuscation Grounding,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29407,"Indraneil Paul, Haoyi Yang, Goran Glavaš, Kristian Kersting, Iryna Gurevych","Language models (LMs) have become a staple of the code-writing toolbox. Their pre-training recipe has, however, remained stagnant over recent years, barring the occasional changes in data sourcing and filtering strategies. In particular, research exploring modifications to Code-LMs' pre-training objectives, geared towards improving data efficiency and better disentangling between syntax and semantics, has been noticeably sparse, especially compared with corresponding efforts in natural language LMs. In this work, we examine grounding on obfuscated code as a means of helping Code-LMs look beyond the surface-form syntax and enhance their pre-training sample efficiency. To this end, we compile ObscuraX, a dataset of approximately 55M source and obfuscated code pairs in seven languages. Subsequently, we pre-train ObscuraCoder models, ranging in size from 255M to 2.8B parameters, on a 272B-token corpus that includes ObscuraX and demonstrate that our obfuscation-based pre-training recipe leads to consistent improvements in Code-LMs' abilities compared to both vanilla autoregressive pre-training as well as existing de-obfuscation (DOBF) objectives. ObscuraCoder demonstrates sizeable gains across multiple tests of syntactic and semantic code understanding, along with improved capabilities in multilingual code completion, multilingual code commit summarization, and multi-purpose library-oriented code generation."
Poster,OCCAM: Towards Cost-Efficient and Accuracy-Aware Classification Inference,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30510,"Dujian Ding, Bicheng Xu, Laks Lakshmanan","Classification tasks play a fundamental role in various applications, spanning domains such as healthcare, natural language processing and computer vision. With the growing popularity and capacity of machine learning models, people can easily access trained classifiers as a service online or offline. However, model use comes with a cost and classifiers of higher capacity (such as large foundation models) usually incur higher inference costs. To harness the respective strengths of different classifiers, we propose a principled approach, OCCAM, to compute the best classifier assignment strategy over classification queries (termed as the optimal model portfolio) so that the aggregated accuracy is maximized, under user-specified cost budgets. Our approach uses an unbiased and low-variance accuracy estimator and effectively computes the optimal solution by solving an integer linear programming problem. On a variety of real-world datasets, OCCAM achieves 40% cost reduction with little to no accuracy drop."
Poster,Occlusion-aware Non-Rigid Point Cloud Registration via Unsupervised Neural Deformation Correntropy,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29032,"Mingyang Zhao, Gaofeng Meng, Dong-ming Yan","Non-rigid alignment of point clouds is crucial for scene understanding, reconstruction, and various computer vision and robotics tasks. Recent advancements in implicit deformation networks for non-rigid registration have significantly reduced the reliance on large amounts of annotated training data. However, existing state-of-the-art methods still face challenges in handling occlusion scenarios. To address this issue, this paper introduces an innovative unsupervised method called Occlusion-Aware Registration (OAR) for non-rigidly aligning point clouds. The key innovation of our method lies in the utilization of the adaptive correntropy function as a localized similarity measure, enabling us to treat individual points distinctly. In contrast to previous approaches that solely minimize overall deviations between two shapes, we combine unsupervised implicit neural representations with the maximum correntropy criterion to optimize the deformation of unoccluded regions. This effectively avoids collapsed, tearing, and other physically implausible results. Moreover, we present a theoretical analysis and establish the relationship between the maximum correntropy criterion and the commonly used Chamfer distance, highlighting that the correntropy-induced metric can be served as a more universal measure for point cloud analysis. Additionally, we introducelocally linear reconstruction to ensure that regions lacking correspondences between shapes still undergo physically natural deformations. Our method achieves superior or competitive performance compared to existing approaches, particularly when dealing with occluded geometries. We also demonstrate the versatility of our method in challenging tasks such as large deformations, shape interpolation, and shape completion under occlusion disturbances."
Poster,OccProphet: Pushing the Efficiency Frontier of Camera-Only 4D Occupancy Forecasting with an Observer-Forecaster-Refiner Framework,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27927,"Junliang Chen, Huaiyuan Xu, Yi Wang, Lap-Pui Chau","Predicting variations in complex traffic environments is crucial for the safety of autonomous driving. Recent advancements in occupancy forecasting have enabled forecasting future 3D occupied status in driving environments by observing historical 2D images. However, high computational demands make occupancy forecasting less efficient during training and inference stages, hindering its feasibility for deployment on edge agents. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, \textit{i.e.}, OccProphet, to efficiently and effectively learn occupancy forecasting with significantly lower computational requirements while improving forecasting accuracy. OccProphet comprises three lightweight components: Observer, Forecaster, and Refiner. The Observer extracts spatio-temporal features from 3D multi-frame voxels using the proposed Efficient 4D Aggregation with Tripling-Attention Fusion, while the Forecaster and Refiner conditionally predict and refine future occupancy inferences. Experimental results on nuScenes, Lyft-Level5, and nuScenes-Occupancy datasets demonstrate that OccProphet is both training- and inference-friendly. OccProphet reduces 58\%$\sim$78\% of the computational cost with a 2.6$\times$ speedup compared with the state-of-the-art Cam4DOcc. Moreover, it achieves 4\%$\sim$18\% relatively higher forecasting accuracy. Code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/JLChen-C/OccProphet."
Poster,OCEAN: Offline Chain-of-thought Evaluation and Alignment in Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28173,"Junda Wu, Xintong Li, Ruoyu Wang, Yu Xia, Yuxin Xiong, Jianing Wang, Tong Yu, Xiang Chen, Branislav Kveton, Lina Yao, Jingbo Shang, Julian McAuley","Offline evaluation of LLMs is crucial in understanding their capacities, though current methods remain underexplored in existing research. In this work, we focus on the offline evaluation of the chain-of-thought capabilities and show how to optimize LLMs based on the proposed evaluation method. To enable offline feedback with rich knowledge and reasoning paths, we use knowledge graphs (KGs) (e.g., Wikidata5M) to provide feedback on the generated chain of thoughts. Due to the heterogeneity between LLM reasoning and KG structures, direct interaction and feedback from knowledge graphs on LLM behavior are challenging, as they require accurate entity linking and grounding of LLM-generated chains of thought in the KG. To address the above challenge, we propose an offline chain-of-thought evaluation framework, OCEAN, which models chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and evaluate the policy’s alignment with KG preference modeling. To overcome the reasoning heterogeneity and grounding problems, we leverage on-policy KG exploration and reinforcement learning to model a KG policy that generates token-level likelihood distributions for LLM-generated chain-of-thought reasoning paths, simulating KG reasoning preference. Then we incorporate the knowledge-graph feedback on the validity and alignment of the generated reasoning paths into inverse propensity scores and propose KG-IPS estimator. Theoretically, we prove the unbiasedness of the proposed KG-IPS estimator and provide a lower bound on its variance. With the off-policy evaluated value function, we can directly enable off-policy optimization to further enhance chain-of-thought alignment. Our empirical study shows that OCEAN can be efficiently optimized for generating chain-of-thought reasoning paths with higher estimated values without affecting LLMs’ general abilities in downstream tasks or their internal knowledge."
Poster,ODE-based Smoothing Neural Network for Reinforcement Learning Tasks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29629,"Yinuo Wang, Wenxuan Wang, Xujie Song, Tong Liu, Yuming Yin, Liangfa Chen, Likun Wang, Jingliang Duan, Shengbo Li","The smoothness of control actions is a significant challenge faced by deep reinforcement learning (RL) techniques in solving optimal control problems. Existing RL-trained policies tend to produce non-smooth actions due to high-frequency input noise and unconstrained Lipschitz constants in neural networks. This article presents a Smooth ODE (SmODE) network capable of simultaneously addressing both causes of unsmooth control actions, thereby enhancing policy performance and robustness under noise condition. We first design a smooth ODE neuron with first-order low-pass filtering expression, which can dynamically filter out high frequency noises of hidden state by a learnable state-based system time constant. Additionally, we construct a state-based mapping function, $g$, and theoretically demonstrate its capacity to control the ODE neuron's Lipschitz constant. Then, based on the above neuronal structure design, we further advanced the SmODE network serving as RL policy approximators. This network is compatible with most existing RL algorithms, offering improved adaptability compared to prior approaches. Various experiments show that our SmODE network demonstrates superior anti-interference capabilities and smoother action outputs than the multi-layer perception and smooth network architectures like LipsNet."
Poster,O(d/T) Convergence Theory for Diffusion Probabilistic Models under Minimal Assumptions,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31027,"Gen Li, Yuling Yan","Score-based diffusion models, which generate new data by learning to reverse a diffusion process that perturbs data from the target distribution into noise, have achieved remarkable success across various generative tasks. Despite their superior empirical performance, existing theoretical guarantees are often constrained by stringent assumptions or suboptimal convergence rates. In this paper, we establish a fast convergence theory for the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), a widely used SDE-based sampler, under minimal assumptions. Our analysis shows that, provided $\ell_{2}$-accurate estimates of the score functions, the total variation distance between the target and generated distributions is upper bounded by $O(d/T)$ (ignoring logarithmic factors), where $d$ is the data dimensionality and $T$ is the number of steps. This result holds for any target distribution with finite first-order moment. To our knowledge, this improves upon existing convergence theory for the DDPM sampler, while imposing minimal assumptions on the target data distribution and score estimates. This is achieved through a novel set of analytical tools that provides a fine-grained characterization of how the error propagates at each step of the reverse process."
Poster,Offline Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning via Inverse Optimization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28982,"Carolin Schmidt, Daniele Gammelli, James Harrison, Marco Pavone, Filipe Rodrigues","Hierarchical policies enable strong performance in many sequential decision-making problems, such as those with high-dimensional action spaces, those requiring long-horizon planning, and settings with sparse rewards. However, learning hierarchical policies from static offline datasets presents a significant challenge.Crucially, actions taken by higher-level policies may not be directly observable within hierarchical controllers, and the offline dataset might have been generated using a different policy structure, hindering the use of standard offline learning algorithms.In this work, we propose $\textit{OHIO}$: a framework for offline reinforcement learning (RL) of hierarchical policies. Our framework leverages knowledge of the policy structure to solve the $\textit{inverse problem}$, recovering the unobservable high-level actions that likely generated the observed data under our hierarchical policy.This approach constructs a dataset suitable for off-the-shelf offline training.We demonstrate our framework on robotic and network optimization problems and show that it substantially outperforms end-to-end RL methods and improves robustness.  We investigate a variety of instantiations of our framework, both in direct deployment of policies trained offline and when online fine-tuning is performed.

Poster,Offline Model-Based Optimization by Learning to Rank,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28117,"Rong-Xi Tan, Ke Xue, Shen-Huan Lyu, Haopu Shang, Yao Wang, Yaoyuan Wang, Fu Sheng, Chao Qian","Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to identify a design that maximizes a black-box function using only a fixed, pre-collected dataset of designs and their corresponding scores. This problem has garnered significant attention from both scientific and industrial domains. A common approach in offline MBO is to train a regression-based surrogate model by minimizing mean squared error (MSE) and then find the best design within this surrogate model by different optimizers (e.g., gradient ascent). However, a critical challenge is the risk of out-of-distribution errors, i.e., the surrogate model may typically overestimate the scores and mislead the optimizers into suboptimal regions. Prior works have attempted to address this issue in various ways, such as using regularization techniques and ensemble learning to enhance the robustness of the model, but it still remains. In this paper, we argue that regression models trained with MSE are not well-aligned with the primary goal of offline MBO, which is to \textit{select} promising designs rather than to predict their scores precisely. Notably, if a surrogate model can maintain the order of candidate designs based on their relative score relationships, it can produce the best designs even without precise predictions. To validate it, we conduct experiments to compare the relationship between the quality of the final designs and MSE, finding that the correlation is really very weak. In contrast, a metric that measures order-maintaining quality shows a significantly stronger correlation. Based on this observation, we propose learning a ranking-based model that leverages learning to rank techniques to prioritize promising designs based on their relative scores. We show that the generalization error on ranking loss can be well bounded. Empirical results across diverse tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed ranking-based method than twenty existing methods. Our implementation is available at \url{https://github.com/lamda-bbo/Offline-RaM}."
Poster,Offline RL in Regular Decision Processes: Sample Efficiency via Language Metrics,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30400,"Ahana Deb, Roberto Cipollone, Anders Jonsson, Alessandro Ronca, Mohammad Sadegh Talebi","This work studies offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a class of non-Markovian environments called Regular Decision Processes (RDPs). In RDPs, the unknown dependency of future observations and rewards from the past interactions can be captured by some hidden finite-state automaton. For this reason, many RDP algorithms first reconstruct this unknown dependency using automata learning techniques. In this paper, we consider episodic RDPs and show that it is possible to overcome the limitations of existing offline RL algorithms for RDPs viathe introduction of two original techniques: a novel metric grounded in formal language theory and an approach based on Count-Min-Sketch (CMS). Owing to the novel language metric, our algorithm is proven to be more sample efficient than existing results, and in some problem instances admitting low complexity languages, the gain is showcased to be exponential in the episode length. The CMS-based approach removes the need for naïve counting and alleviates the memory requirements for long planning horizons. We derive Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) sample complexity bounds associated to each of these techniques, and validate the approach experimentally."
