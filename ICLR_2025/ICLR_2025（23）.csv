Poster,Any-step Dynamics Model Improves Future Predictions for Online and Offline Reinforcement Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30099,"Haoxin Lin, Yu-Yan Xu, Yihao Sun, Zhilong Zhang, Yi-Chen Li, Chengxing Jia, Junyin Ye, Jiaji Zhang, Yang Yu","Model-based methods in reinforcement learning offer a promising approach to enhance data efficiency by facilitating policy exploration within a dynamics model. However, accurately predicting sequential steps in the dynamics model remains a challenge due to the bootstrapping prediction, which attributes the next state to the prediction of the current state. This leads to accumulated errors during model roll-out. In this paper, we propose the Any-step Dynamics Model (ADM) to mitigate the compounding error by reducing bootstrapping prediction to direct prediction. ADM allows for the use of variable-length plans as inputs for predicting future states without frequent bootstrapping. We design two algorithms, ADMPO-ON and ADMPO-OFF, which apply ADM in online and offline model-based frameworks, respectively. In the online setting, ADMPO-ON demonstrates improved sample efficiency compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. In the offline setting, ADMPO-OFF not only demonstrates superior performance compared to recent state-of-the-art offline approaches but also offers better quantification of model uncertainty using only a single ADM."
Poster,AnyTouch: Learning Unified Static-Dynamic Representation across Multiple Visuo-tactile Sensors,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29304,"Ruoxuan Feng, Jiangyu Hu, Wenke Xia, Tianci Gao, Ao Shen, Yuhao Sun, Bin Fang, Di Hu","Visuo-tactile sensors aim to emulate human tactile perception, enabling robots to precisely understand and manipulate objects. Over time, numerous meticulously designed visuo-tactile sensors have been integrated into robotic systems, aiding in completing various tasks. However, the distinct data characteristics of these low-standardized visuo-tactile sensors hinder the establishment of a powerful tactile perception system. We consider that the key to addressing this issue lies in learning unified multi-sensor representations, thereby integrating the sensors and promoting  tactile knowledge transfer between them. To achieve unified representation of this nature, we introduce TacQuad, an aligned multi-modal multi-sensor tactile dataset from four different visuo-tactile sensors, which enables the explicit integration of various sensors. Recognizing that humans perceive the physical environment by acquiring diverse tactile information such as texture and pressure changes, we further propose to learn unified multi-sensor representations from both static and dynamic perspectives. By integrating tactile images and videos, we present AnyTouch, a unified static-dynamic multi-sensor representation learning framework with a multi-level structure, aimed at both enhancing comprehensive perceptual abilities and enabling effective cross-sensor transfer. This multi-level architecture captures pixel-level details from tactile data via masked modeling and enhances perception and transferability by learning semantic-level sensor-agnostic features through multi-modal alignment and cross-sensor matching. We provide a comprehensive analysis of multi-sensor transferability, and validate our method on various offline datasets and in the real-world pouring task. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods, exhibits outstanding static and dynamic perception capabilities across various sensors. The code, TacQuad dataset and AnyTouch model are fully available at gewu-lab.github.io/AnyTouch/."
Poster,APE: Faster and Longer Context-Augmented Generation via Adaptive Parallel Encoding,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27725,"Xinyu Yang, Tianqi Chen, Beidi Chen","Context-augmented generation (CAG) techniques, including RAG and ICL, require the efficient combination of multiple contexts to generate responses to user queries. Directly inputting these contexts as a sequence introduces a considerable computational burden by re-encoding the combined selection of contexts for every request. To address this, we explore the promising potential of parallel encoding to independently pre-compute and cache each context's KV states. This approach enables the direct loading of cached states during inference while accommodating more contexts through position reuse across contexts. However, due to misalignments in attention distribution, directly applying parallel encoding results in a significant performance drop. To enable effective and efficient CAG, we propose Adaptive Parallel Encoding (**APE**), which brings shared prefix, attention temperature, and scaling factor to align the distribution of parallel encoding with sequential encoding. Results on RAG and ICL tasks demonstrate that APE can preserve 98\% and 93\% sequential encoding performance using the same inputs while outperforming parallel encoding by 3.6\% and 7.9\%, respectively. It also scales to many-shot CAG, effectively encoding hundreds of contexts in parallel. Efficiency evaluation shows that APE can achieve an end-to-end 4.5$\times$ speedup by reducing 28$\times$ prefilling time for a 128K-length context. The code is available at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/APE."
Poster,A Percolation Model of Emergence: Analyzing Transformers Trained on a Formal Language,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31234,"Ekdeep Singh Lubana, Kyogo Kawaguchi, Robert Dick, Hidenori Tanaka","Increase in data, size, or compute can lead to sudden learning of specific capabilities by a neural network---a phenomenon often called ""emergence"". Beyond scientific understanding, establishing the causal factors underlying such emergent capabilities is crucial to enable risk regulation frameworks for AI. In this work, we seek inspiration from study of emergent properties in other fields and propose a phenomenological definition for the concept in the context of neural networks. Our definition implicates the acquisition of general regularities underlying the data-generating process as a cause of sudden performance growth for specific, narrower tasks. We empirically investigate this definition by proposing an experimental system grounded in a context-sensitive formal language, and find that Transformers trained to perform tasks on top of strings from this language indeed exhibit emergent capabilities. Specifically, we show that once the language's underlying grammar and context-sensitivity inducing regularities are learned by the model, performance on narrower tasks suddenly begins to improve. We then analogize our network's learning dynamics with the process of percolation on a bipartite graph, establishing a formal phase transition model that predicts the shift in the point of emergence observed in our experiments when intervening on the data regularities. Overall, our experimental and theoretical frameworks yield a step towards better defining, characterizing, and predicting emergence in neural networks."
Poster,A Periodic Bayesian Flow for Material Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29962,"Hanlin Wu, Yuxuan Song, Jingjing Gong, Ziyao Cao, Yawen Ouyang, Jianbing Zhang, Hao Zhou, Wei-Ying Ma, Jingjing Liu","Generative modeling of crystal data distribution is an important yet challenging task due to the unique periodic physical symmetry of crystals. Diffusion-based methods have shown early promise in modeling crystal distribution. More recently, Bayesian Flow Networks were introduced to aggregate noisy latent variables, resulting in a variance-reduced parameter space that has been shown to be advantageous for modeling Euclidean data distributions with structural constraints (Song, et al.,2023). Inspired by this, we seek to unlock its potential for modeling variables located in non-Euclidean manifolds e.g. those within crystal structures, by overcoming challenging theoretical issues. We introduce CrysBFN, a novel crystal generation method by proposing a periodic Bayesian flow, which essentially differs from the original Gaussian-based BFN by exhibiting non-monotonic entropy dynamics. To successfully realize the concept of periodic Bayesian flow, CrysBFN integrates a new entropy conditioning mechanism and empirically demonstrates its significance compared to time-conditioning. Extensive experiments over both crystal ab initio generation and crystal structure prediction tasks demonstrate the superiority of CrysBFN, which consistently achieves new state-of-the-art on all benchmarks. Surprisingly, we found that CrysBFN enjoys a significant improvement in sampling efficiency, e.g., 200x speedup (10 v.s. 2000 steps network forwards) compared with previous Diffusion-based methods on MP-20 dataset."
Poster,API Pack: A Massive Multi-Programming Language Dataset for API Call Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28893,"Gavin (Zhen) Guo, Adriana Meza Soria, Wei Sun, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda","We introduce API Pack, a massive multi-programming language dataset containing over one million instruction-API calls for improving the API call generation capabilities of large language models. Our evaluation highlights three key findings: First, fine-tuning on API Pack enables open-source models to outperform GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in generating code for entirely new API calls. We show this by fine-tuning CodeLlama-13B on 20,000 Python instances from API Pack. Second, fine-tuning on a large dataset in one language, combined with smaller datasets from others, improves API generation accuracy across multiple languages. Third, we confirm the benefits of larger datasets for API generalization, as increasing fine-tuning data to one million instances enhances generalization to new APIs. To support further research, we open-source the API Pack dataset, trained model, and code at https://github.com/zguo0525/API-Pack."
Poster,A Policy-Gradient Approach to Solving Imperfect-Information Games with Best-Iterate Convergence,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29215,"Mingyang Liu, Gabriele Farina, Asuman Ozdaglar","Policy gradient methods have become a staple of any single-agent reinforcement learning toolbox, due to their combination of desirable properties: iterate convergence, efficient use of stochastic trajectory feedback, and theoretically-sound avoidance of importance sampling corrections. In multi-agent imperfect-information settings (extensive-form games), however, it is still unknown whether the same desiderata can be guaranteed while retaining theoretical guarantees. Instead, sound methods for extensive-form games rely on approximating \emph{counterfactual} values (as opposed to Q values), which are incompatible with policy gradient methodologies. In this paper, we investigate whether policy gradient can be safely used in two-player zero-sum imperfect-information extensive-form games (EFGs). We establish positive results, showing for the first time that a policy gradient method leads to provable best-iterate convergence to a regularized Nash equilibrium in self-play."
Poster,Apollo-MILP: An Alternating Prediction-Correction Neural Solving Framework for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28474,"Haoyang Liu, Jie Wang, Zijie Geng, Xijun Li, Yuxuan Zong, Fangzhou Zhu, Jianye HAO, Feng Wu","Leveraging machine learning (ML) to predict an initial solution for mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has gained considerable popularity in recent years. These methods predict a solution and fix a subset of variables to reduce the problem dimension. Then, they solve the reduced problem to obtain the final solutions. However, directly fixing variable values can lead to low-quality solutions or even infeasible reduced problems if the predicted solution is not accurate enough. To address this challenge, we propose an Alternating prediction-correction neural solving framework (Apollo-MILP) that can identify and select accurate and reliable predicted values to fix. In each iteration, Apollo-MILP conducts a prediction step for the unfixed variables, followed by a correction step to obtain an improved solution (called reference solution) through a trust-region search. By incorporating the predicted and reference solutions, we introduce a novel Uncertainty-based Error upper BOund (UEBO) to evaluate the uncertainty of the predicted values and fix those with high confidence. A notable feature of Apollo-MILP is the superior ability for problem reduction while preserving optimality, leading to high-quality final solutions. Experiments on commonly used benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed Apollo-MILP significantly outperforms other ML-based approaches in terms of solution quality, achieving over a 50% reduction in the solution gap."
Poster,Approaching Rate-Distortion Limits in Neural Compression with Lattice Transform Coding,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29503,"Eric Lei, Hamed Hassani, Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti","Neural compression has brought tremendous progress in designing lossy compressors with good rate-distortion (RD) performance at low complexity. Thus far, neural compression design involves transforming the source to a latent vector, which is then rounded to integers and entropy coded. While this approach has been shown to be optimal on a few specific sources, we show that it can be highly sub-optimal on synthetic sources whose intrinsic dimensionality is greater than one. With integer rounding in the latent space, the quantization regions induced by neural transformations, remain square-like and fail to match those of optimal vector quantization. We demonstrate that this phenomenon is due to the choice of scalar quantization in the latent space, and not the transform design. By employing lattice quantization instead, we propose  Lattice Transform Coding (LTC) and show that it approximately recovers optimal vector quantization at reasonable complexity. On real-world sources, LTC improves upon standard neural compressors. LTC also provides a framework that can integrate structurally (near) optimal information-theoretic designs into lossy compression; examples include block coding, which yields coding gain over optimal one-shot coding and approaches the asymptotically-achievable rate-distortion function, as well as nested lattice quantization for low complexity fixed-rate coding."
Poster,Approximating Full Conformal Prediction for Neural Network Regression with Gauss-Newton Influence,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27902,"Dharmesh Tailor, Alvaro Correia, Eric Nalisnick, Christos Louizos","Uncertainty quantification is an important prerequisite for the deployment of deep learning models in safety-critical areas. Yet, this hinges on the uncertainty estimates being useful to the extent the prediction intervals are well-calibrated and sharp. In the absence of inherent uncertainty estimates (e.g. pretrained models predicting only point estimates), popular approaches that operate post-hoc include Laplace’s method and split conformal prediction (split-CP). However, Laplace’s method can be miscalibrated when the model is misspecified and split-CP requires sample splitting, and thus comes at the expense of statistical efficiency. In this work, we construct prediction intervals for neural network regressors post-hoc without held-out data. This is achieved by approximating the full conformal prediction method (full-CP). Whilst full-CP nominally requires retraining the model for every test point and candidate label, we propose to train just once and locally perturb model parameters using Gauss-Newton influence to approximate the effect of retraining. Coupled with linearization of the network, we express the absolute residual nonconformity score as a piecewise linear function of the candidate label allowing for an efficient procedure that avoids the exhaustive search over the output space. On standard regression benchmarks and bounding box localization, we show the resulting prediction intervals are locally-adaptive and often tighter than those of split-CP."
