Poster,Advancing Graph Generation through Beta Diffusion,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27807,"Xinyang Liu, Yilin He, Bo Chen, Mingyuan Zhou","Diffusion models have excelled in generating natural images and are now being adapted to a variety of data types, including graphs. However, conventional models often rely on Gaussian or categorical diffusion processes, which can struggle to accommodate the mixed discrete and continuous components characteristic of graph data. Graphs typically feature discrete structures and continuous node attributes that often exhibit rich statistical patterns, including sparsity, bounded ranges, skewed distributions, and long-tailed behavior. To address these challenges, we introduce Graph Beta Diffusion (GBD), a generative model specifically designed to handle the diverse nature of graph data. GBD leverages a beta diffusion process, effectively modeling both continuous and discrete elements. Additionally, we propose a modulation technique that enhances the realism of generated graphs by stabilizing critical graph topology while maintaining flexibility for other components. GBD competes strongly with existing models across multiple general and biochemical graph benchmarks, showcasing its ability to capture the intricate balance between discrete and continuous features inherent in real-world graph data. Our PyTorch code is available at https://github.com/xinyangATK/GraphBetaDiffusion."
Poster,Advancing LLM Reasoning Generalists with Preference Trees,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31127,"Lifan Yuan, Ganqu Cui, Hanbin Wang, Ning Ding, Xingyao Wang, Boji Shan, Zeyuan Liu, Jia Deng, Huimin Chen, Ruobing Xie, Yankai Lin, Zhenghao Liu, Bowen Zhou, Hao Peng, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun","We introduce EURUS, a suite of large language models (LLMs) optimized for reasoning. Finetuned from Mistral-7B, Llama-3-8B, and Mixtral-8x22B, EURUS models achieve state-of-the-art results among open-source models on a diverse set of benchmarks covering mathematics, code generation, and logical reasoning problems. Notably, EURUX-8X22B outperforms GPT-3.5 Turbo in reasoning through a comprehensive benchmarking across 12 test sets covering five tasks. The strong performance of EURUS can be primarily attributed to ULTRAINTERACT, our newly-curated large-scale, high-quality training data dataset specifically designed for complex reasoning tasks. ULTRAINTERACT can be used in both supervised fine-tuning, preference learning, and reward modeling. It pairs each instruction with a preference tree consisting of (1) reasoning chains with diverse planning strategies in a unified format, (2) multi-turn interaction trajectories with the environment and the critique, and (3) pairwise positive and negative responses to facilitate preference learning. ULTRAINTERACT allows us to conduct an in-depth exploration of preference learning for reasoning tasks. Our investigation reveals that some well-established preference learning algorithms may be less suitable for reasoning tasks compared to their effectiveness in general conversations. The hypothesis is that in reasoning tasks, the space of correct answers is much smaller than that of incorrect ones, so it is necessary to explicitly increase the reward of chosen data. Therefore, in addition to increasing the reward margin as many preference learning algorithms do, the absolute values of positive responses’ rewards should be positive and may serve as a proxy for performance. Inspired by this, we derive a novel reward modeling objective and empirically that it leads to a stable reward modeling curve and better performance. Together with ULTRAINTERACT, we obtain a strong reward model."
Poster,"Advancing Mathematical Reasoning in Language Models: The Impact of Problem-Solving Data, Data Synthesis Methods, and Training Stages",https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30252,"Zui Chen, Tianqiao Liu, Tongqing, Mi Tian, Weiqi Luo, Zitao Liu","Mathematical reasoning remains a challenging area for large language models (LLMs), prompting the development of math-specific LLMs such as LLEMMA, DeepSeekMath, and Qwen2-Math, among others. These models typically follow a two-stage training paradigm: pre-training with math-related corpora and post-training with problem datasets for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite these efforts, the improvements in mathematical reasoning achieved through continued pre-training (CPT) are often less significant compared to those obtained via SFT. This study addresses this discrepancy by exploring alternative strategies during the pre-training phase, focusing on the use of problem-solving data over general mathematical corpora.We investigate three primary research questions: (1) Can problem-solving data enhance the model's mathematical reasoning capabilities more effectively than general mathematical corpora during CPT? (2) Are synthetic data from the same source equally effective, and which synthesis methods are most efficient? (3) How do the capabilities developed from the same problem-solving data differ between the CPT and SFT stages, and what factors contribute to these differences?Our findings indicate that problem-solving data significantly enhances the model's mathematical capabilities compared to general mathematical corpora. We also identify effective data synthesis methods, demonstrating that the tutorship amplification synthesis method achieves the best performance. Furthermore, while SFT facilitates instruction-following abilities, it underperforms compared to CPT with the same data, which can be partially attributed to its poor learning capacity for more challenging problem-solving data. These insights provide valuable guidance for optimizing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, culminating in our development of a powerful mathematical base model called MathGPT-8B."
Poster,Advancing Out-of-Distribution Detection via Local Neuroplasticity,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31215,"Alessandro Canevaro, Julian Schmidt, Sajad Marvi, Hang Yu, Georg Martius, Julian Jordan","In the domain of machine learning, the assumption that training and test data share the same distribution is often violated in real-world scenarios, requiring effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. This paper presents a novel OOD detection method that leverages the unique local neuroplasticity property of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Unlike traditional multilayer perceptrons, KANs exhibit local plasticity, allowing them to preserve learned information while adapting to new tasks. Our method compares the activation patterns of a trained KAN against its untrained counterpart to detect OOD samples. We validate our approach on benchmarks from image and medical domains, demonstrating superior performance and robustness compared to state-of-the-art techniques. These results underscore the potential of KANs in enhancing the reliability of machine learning systems in diverse environments."
Poster,Advancing Prompt-Based Methods for Replay-Independent General Continual Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29430,"Zhiqi KANG, Liyuan Wang, Xingxing Zhang, Karteek Alahari","General continual learning (GCL) is a broad concept to describe real-world continual learning (CL) problems, which are often characterized by online data streams without distinct transitions between tasks, i.e., blurry task boundaries. Such requirements result in poor initial performance, limited generalizability, and severe catastrophic forgetting, heavily impacting the effectiveness of mainstream GCL models trained from scratch. While the use of a frozen pretrained backbone with appropriate prompt tuning can partially address these challenges, such prompt-based methods remain suboptimal for CL of remaining tunable parameters on the fly. In this regard, we propose an innovative approach named MISA (Mask and Initial Session Adaption) to advance prompt-based methods in GCL. It includes a forgetting-aware initial session adaption that employs pretraining data to initialize prompt parameters and improve generalizability, as well as a non-parametric logit mask of the output layers to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Empirical results demonstrate substantial performance gains of our approach compared to recent competitors, especially without a replay buffer (e.g., up to 18.39, 22.06, and 11.96% points performance lead on CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-R, respectively). Moreover, our approach features the plug-in nature for prompt-based methods, independence of replay, ease of implementation, and avoidance of CL-relevant hyperparameters, serving as a strong baseline for GCL research.

Poster,Advantage Alignment Algorithms,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29701,"Juan Duque, Milad Aghajohari, Timotheus Cooijmans, Razvan Ciuca, Tianyu Zhang, Gauthier Gidel, Aaron Courville","Artificially intelligent agents are increasingly being integrated into human decision-making: from large language model (LLM) assistants to autonomous vehicles. These systems often optimize their individual objective, leading to conflicts, particularly in general-sum games where naive reinforcement learning agents empirically converge to Pareto-suboptimal Nash equilibria. To address this issue, opponent shaping has emerged as a paradigm for finding socially beneficial equilibria in general-sum games. In this work, we introduce Advantage Alignment, a family of algorithms derived from first principles that perform opponent shaping efficiently and intuitively. We achieve this by aligning the advantages of interacting agents, increasing the probability of mutually beneficial actions when their interaction has been positive. We prove that existing opponent shaping methods implicitly perform Advantage Alignment. Compared to these methods, Advantage Alignment simplifies the mathematical formulation of opponent shaping, reduces the computational burden and extends to continuous action domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms across a range of social dilemmas, achieving state-of-the-art cooperation and robustness against exploitation."
Poster,Advantage-Guided Distillation for Preference Alignment in Small Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27759,"Shiping Gao, Fanqi Wan, Jiajian Guo, Xiaojun Quan, Qifan Wang","Alignment techniques enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate outputs that align with human preferences and play a crucial role in their effectiveness. However, their impact often diminishes when applied to Small Language Models (SLMs), likely due to the limited capacity of these models. Instead of directly applying existing alignment techniques to SLMs, we propose to utilize a well-aligned teacher LLM to guide the alignment process for these models, thereby facilitating the transfer of the teacher's knowledge of human preferences to the student model. To achieve this, we first explore a straightforward approach, Dual-Constrained Knowledge Distillation (DCKD), that employs knowledge distillation with two KL-divergence constraints from the aligned teacher to the unaligned student. To further enhance the student's ability to distinguish between preferred and dispreferred responses, we then propose Advantage-Guided Distillation for Preference Alignment (ADPA), which leverages an advantage function from the aligned teacher to deliver more nuanced, distribution-level reward signals for the student's alignment. Our experimental results show that these two approaches appreciably improve the alignment of SLMs and narrow the performance gap with larger counterparts. Among them, ADPA demonstrates superior performance and achieves even greater effectiveness when integrated with DCKD. Our code is available at https://github.com/SLIT-AI/ADPA ."
Poster,Adversarial Attacks on Data Attribution,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28363,"Xinhe Wang, Pingbang Hu, Junwei Deng, Jiaqi Ma","Data attribution aims to quantify the contribution of individual training data points to the outputs of an AI model, which has been used to measure the value of training data and compensate data providers. Given the impact on financial decisions and compensation mechanisms, a critical question arises concerning the adversarial robustness of data attribution methods. However, there has been little to no systematic research addressing this issue. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by detailing a threat model with clear assumptions about the adversary's goal and capabilities and proposing principled adversarial attack methods on data attribution. We present two methods, *Shadow Attack* and *Outlier Attack*, which generate manipulated datasets to inflate the compensation adversarially. The Shadow Attack leverages knowledge about the data distribution in the AI applications, and derives adversarial perturbations through ""shadow training"", a technique commonly used in membership inference attacks. In contrast, the Outlier Attack does not assume any knowledge about the data distribution and relies solely on black-box queries to the target model's predictions. It exploits an inductive bias present in many data attribution methods - outlier data points are more likely to be influential - and employs adversarial examples to generate manipulated datasets. Empirically, in image classification and text generation tasks, the Shadow Attack can inflate the data-attribution-based compensation by at least 200%, while the Outlier Attack achieves compensation inflation ranging from 185% to as much as 643%.

Poster,Adversarial Generative Flow Network for Solving Vehicle Routing Problems,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28069,"Ni Zhang, Jingfeng Yang, Zhiguang Cao, Xu Chi","Recent research into solving vehicle routing problems (VRPs) has gained significant traction, particularly through the application of deep (reinforcement) learning for end-to-end solution construction. However, many current construction-based neural solvers predominantly utilize Transformer architectures, which can face scalability challenges and struggle to produce diverse solutions. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework beyond Transformer-based approaches, i.e., Adversarial Generative Flow Networks (AGFN). This framework integrates the generative flow network (GFlowNet)—a probabilistic model inherently adept at generating diverse solutions (routes)—with a complementary model for discriminating (or evaluating) the solutions. These models are trained alternately in an adversarial manner to improve the overall solution quality, followed by a proposed hybrid decoding method to construct the solution. We apply the AGFN framework to solve the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) and travelling salesman problem (TSP), and our experimental results demonstrate that AGFN surpasses the popular construction-based neural solvers, showcasing strong generalization capabilities on synthetic and real-world benchmark instances."
Poster,Adversarial Latent Feature Augmentation for Fairness,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29055,"Hoin Jung, Junyi Chai, Xiaoqian Wang","Achieving fairness in machine learning remains a critical challenge, especially due to the opaque effects of data augmentation on input spaces within nonlinear neural networks. Nevertheless, current approaches that emphasize augmenting latent features, rather than input spaces, offer limited insights into their ability to detect and mitigate bias. In response, we introduce the concept of the ""unfair region"" in the latent space, a subspace that highlights areas where misclassification rates for certain demographic groups are disproportionately high, leading to unfair prediction results. To address this, we propose Adversarial Latent Feature Augmentation (ALFA), a method that leverages adversarial fairness attacks to perturb latent space features, which are then used as data augmentation for fine-tuning. ALFA intentionally shifts latent features into unfair regions, and the last layer of the network is fine-tuned with these perturbed features, leading to a corrected decision boundary that enhances fairness in classification in a cost-effective manner. We present a theoretical framework demonstrating that our adversarial fairness objective reliably generates biased feature perturbations, and that fine-tuning on samples from these unfair regions ensures fairness improvements. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, modalities, and backbone networks validate that training with these adversarial features significantly enhances fairness while maintaining predictive accuracy in classification tasks."
