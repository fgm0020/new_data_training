Poster,Scalable Influence and Fact Tracing for Large Language Model Pretraining,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28824,"Tyler Chang, Dheeraj Rajagopal, Tolga Bolukbasi, Lucas Dixon, Ian Tenney","Training data attribution (TDA) methods aim to attribute model outputs back to specific training examples, and the application of these methods to large language model (LLM) outputs could significantly advance model transparency and data curation. However, it has been challenging to date to apply these methods to the full scale of LLM pretraining. In this paper, we refine existing gradient-based methods to work effectively at scale, allowing us to retrieve influential examples for an 8B-parameter language model from a pretraining corpus of over 160B tokens with no need for subsampling or pre-filtering. Our method combines several techniques, including optimizer state correction, a task-specific Hessian approximation, and normalized encodings, which we find to be critical for performance at scale. In quantitative evaluations on a fact tracing task, our method performs best at identifying examples that influence model predictions, but classical, model-agnostic retrieval methods such as BM25 still perform better at finding passages which explicitly contain relevant facts. These results demonstrate a misalignment between factual *attribution* and causal *influence*. With increasing model size and training tokens, we find that influence more closely aligns with factual attribution. Finally, we examine different types of examples identified as influential by our method, finding that while many directly entail a particular fact, others support the same output by reinforcing priors on relation types, common entities, and names. We release our prompt set and model outputs, along with a web-based visualization tool to explore influential examples for factual predictions, commonsense reasoning, arithmetic, and open-ended generation for an 8B-parameter LLM."
Poster,Scalable Mechanistic Neural Networks,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29818,"Jiale Chen, Dingling Yao, Adeel Pervez, Dan Alistarh, Francesco Locatello","We propose Scalable Mechanistic Neural Network (S-MNN), an enhanced neural network framework designed for scientific machine learning applications involving long temporal sequences. By reformulating the original Mechanistic Neural Network (MNN) (Pervez et al., 2024), we reduce the computational time and space complexities from cubic and quadratic with respect to the sequence length, respectively, to linear. This significant improvement enables efficient modeling of long-term dynamics without sacrificing accuracy or interpretability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S-MNN matches the original MNN in precision while substantially reducing computational resources. Consequently, S-MNN can drop-in replace the original MNN in applications, providing a practical and efficient tool for integrating mechanistic bottlenecks into neural network models of complex dynamical systems.

Poster,Scalable Universal T-Cell Receptor Embeddings from Adaptive Immune Repertoires,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27808,"Paidamoyo Chapfuwa, Ilker Demirel, Lorenzo Pisani, Javier Zazo, Elon Portugaly, H. Zahid, Julia Greissl","T cells are a key component of the adaptive immune system, targeting infections, cancers, and allergens with specificity encoded by their T cell receptors (TCRs), and retaining a memory of their targets. High-throughput TCR repertoire sequencing captures a cross-section of TCRs that encode the immune history of any subject, though the data are heterogeneous, high dimensional, sparse, and mostly unlabeled. Sets of TCRs responding to the same antigen, *i.e.*, a protein fragment, co-occur in subjects sharing immune genetics and exposure history. Here, we leverage TCR co-occurrence across a large set of TCR repertoires and employ the GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014)  algorithm to derive low-dimensional, dense vector representations (embeddings) of TCRs. We then aggregate these TCR embeddings to generate subject-level embeddings based on observed *subject-specific* TCR subsets. Further, we leverage random projection theory to improve GloVe's computational efficiency in terms of memory usage and training time. Extensive experimental results show that TCR embeddings targeting the same pathogen have high cosine similarity, and subject-level embeddings encode both immune genetics and pathogenic exposure history."
Poster,Scale-Aware Contrastive Reverse Distillation for Unsupervised Medical Anomaly Detection,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30228,"Chunlei Li, Yilei Shi, Jingliang Hu, Xiaoxiang Zhu, Lichao Mou","Unsupervised anomaly detection using deep learning has garnered significant research attention due to its broad applicability, particularly in medical imaging where labeled anomalous data are scarce. While earlier approaches leverage generative models like autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs), they often fall short due to overgeneralization. Recent methods explore various strategies, including memory banks, normalizing flows, self-supervised learning, and knowledge distillation, to enhance discrimination. Among these, knowledge distillation, particularly reverse distillation, has shown promise. Following this paradigm, we propose a novel scale-aware contrastive reverse distillation model that addresses two key limitations of existing reverse distillation methods: insufficient feature discriminability and inability to handle anomaly scale variations. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive student-teacher learning approach to derive more discriminative representations by generating and exploring out-of-normal distributions. Further, we design a scale adaptation mechanism to softly weight contrastive distillation losses at different scales to account for the scale variation issue. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the efficacy of the proposed method. The code will be made publicly available."
Poster,Scale-aware Recognition in Satellite Images under Resource Constraints,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29697,"Shreelekha Revankar, Cheng Perng Phoo, Utkarsh Kumar Mall, Bharath Hariharan, Kavita Bala","Recognition of features in satellite imagery (forests, swimming pools, etc.) depends strongly on the spatial scale of the concept and therefore the resolution of the images. This poses two challenges:Which resolution is best suited for recognizing a given concept, and where and when should the costlier higher-resolution (HR) imagery be acquired? We present a novel scheme to address these challenges by introducing three components: (1) A technique to  distill knowledge from models trained on HR imagery to recognition models that operate on imagery of lower resolution (LR), (2) a sampling strategy for HR imagery based on model disagreement, and (3) an LLM-based approach for inferring concept ""scale"". With these components we present a system to efficiently perform scale-aware recognition in satellite imagery, improving accuracy over single-scale inference while following budget constraints. **Our novel approach offers up to a 26.3\% improvement over entirely HR baselines, using 76.3 \% fewer HR images.** Resources are available at https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~revankar/scale_aware."
Poster,Scale-Free Graph-Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28413,"Jianglin Lu, Yixuan Liu, Yitian Zhang, Yun Fu","Graph-language models (GLMs) have demonstrated great potential in graph-based semi-supervised learning. A typical GLM consists of two key stages: graph generation and text embedding, which are usually implemented by inferring a latent graph and finetuning a language model (LM), respectively. However, the former often relies on artificial assumptions about the underlying edge distribution, while the latter requires extensive data annotations. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel GLM that integrates graph generation and text embedding within a unified framework. Specifically, for graph generation, we leverage an inherent characteristic of real edge distribution—the scale-free property—as a structural prior. We unexpectedly find that this natural property can be effectively approximated by a simple k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph. For text embedding, we develop a graph-based pseudo-labeler that utilizes scale-free graphs to provide complementary supervision for improved LM finetuning. Extensive experiments on representative datasets validate our findings on the scale-free structural approximation of KNN graphs and demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating graph generation and text embedding with a real structural prior.

Poster,Scaling and evaluating sparse autoencoders,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28040,"Leo Gao, Tom Dupre la Tour, Henk Tillman, Gabriel Goh, Rajan Troll, Alec Radford, Ilya Sutskever, Jan Leike, Jeffrey Wu","Sparse autoencoders provide a promising unsupervised approach for extracting interpretable features from a language model by reconstructing activations from a sparse bottleneck layer. Since language models learn many concepts, autoencoders need to be very large to recover all relevant features. However, studying the properties of autoencoder scaling is difficult due to the need to balance reconstruction and sparsity objectives and the presence of dead latents. We propose using k-sparse autoencoders [Makhzani and Frey, 2013] to directly control sparsity, simplifying tuning and improving the reconstruction-sparsity frontier. Additionally, we find modifications that result in few dead latents, even at the largest scales we tried. Using these techniques, we find clean scaling laws with respect to autoencoder size and sparsity. We also introduce several new metrics for evaluating feature quality based on the recovery of hypothesized features, the explainability of activation patterns, and the sparsity of downstream effects. These metrics all generally improve with autoencoder size. To demonstrate the scalability of our approach, we train a 16 million latent autoencoder on GPT-4 activations for 40 billion tokens. We release training code and autoencoders for open-source models, as well as a visualizer."
Poster,Scaling Autonomous Agents via Automatic Reward Modeling And Planning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27820,"Zhenfang Chen, Delin Chen, Rui Sun, Wenjun Liu, Chuang Gan","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a range of text-generation tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with problems requiring multi-step decision-making and environmental feedback, such as online shopping, scientific reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving. Unlike pure text data, collecting large-scale decision-making data is challenging. Moreover, many powerful LLMs are only accessible through APIs, which hinders their fine-tuning for agent tasks due to cost and complexity. To address LLM agents' limitations, we propose a framework that can automatically learn a reward model from the environment without human annotations. This model can be used to evaluate the action trajectories of LLM agents and provide heuristics for task planning. Specifically, our approach involves employing one LLM-based agent to navigate an environment randomly, generating diverse action trajectories. Subsequently, a separate LLM is leveraged to assign a task intent and synthesize a negative response alongside the correct response for each trajectory. These triplets (task intent, positive response, and negative response) are then utilized as training data to optimize a reward model capable of scoring action trajectories. This reward model can be integrated with LLM-based agents and various planning algorithms to enhance task-solving performance. The effectiveness and generalizability of our framework are demonstrated through evaluations conducted on different agent benchmarks. In conclusion, our proposed framework represents a significant advancement in enhancing LLM agents' decision-making capabilities. By automating the learning of reward models, we overcome the challenges of data scarcity and API limitations, potentially revolutionizing the application of LLMs in complex and interactive environments. This research paves the way for more sophisticated AI agents capable of tackling a wide range of real-world problems requiring multi-step decision-making."
Poster,Scaling Diffusion Language Models via Adaptation from Autoregressive Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28659,"Shansan Gong, Shivam Agarwal, Yizhe Zhang, Jiacheng Ye, Lin Zheng, Mukai Li, Chenxin An, Peilin Zhao, Wei BI, Jiawei Han, Hao Peng, Lingpeng Kong","Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising new paradigm for text generative modeling, potentially addressing limitations of autoregressive (AR) models. However, current DLMs have been studied at a smaller scale compared to their AR counterparts and lack fair comparison on language modeling benchmarks. Additionally, training diffusion models from scratch at scale remains challenging. Given the prevalence of open-source AR language models, we propose adapting these models to build text diffusion models. We demonstrate connections between AR and diffusion modeling objectives and introduce a simple continual pre-training approach for training diffusion models. Through systematic evaluation on language modeling, reasoning, and commonsense benchmarks, we show that we can convert AR models ranging from 127M to 7B parameters (GPT2 and LLaMA) into diffusion models DiffuGPT and DiffuLLaMA, using less than 200B tokens for training. Our experimental results reveal that these models outperform earlier DLMs and are competitive with their AR counterparts. We release a suite of DLMs (127M-355M-7B) capable of generating fluent text, performing in-context learning, filling in the middle without prompt re-ordering, and following instructions."
Poster,Scaling FP8 training to trillion-token LLMs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30430,"Maxim Fishman, Brian Chmiel, Ron Banner, Daniel Soudry","We train, for the first time, large language models using FP8 precision on datasets up to 2 trillion tokens --- a 20-fold increase over previous limits. Through these extended training runs, we uncover critical instabilities in FP8 training that were not observable in earlier works with shorter durations. We trace these instabilities to outlier amplification by the SwiGLU activation function. Interestingly, we show, both analytically and empirically, that this amplification happens only over prolonged training periods, and link it to a  SwiGLU weight alignment process. To address this newly identified issue, we introduce Smooth-SwiGLU, a novel modification that ensures stable FP8 training without altering function behavior. We also demonstrate, for the first time, FP8 quantization of both Adam optimizer moments. Combining these innovations, we successfully train a 7B parameter model using FP8 precision on 256 Intel Gaudi2 accelerators, achieving on-par results with the BF16 baseline while delivering up to a $\sim$ 34 % throughput improvement.
