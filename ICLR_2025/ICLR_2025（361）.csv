Poster,Unbounded: A Generative Infinite Game of Character Life Simulation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27943,"Jialu Li, Yuanzhen Li, Neal Wadhwa, Yael Pritch, David E. Jacobs, Michael Rubinstein, Mohit Bansal, Nataniel Ruiz","We introduce the concept of a generative infinite game, a video game that transcends the traditional boundaries of finite, hard-coded systems by using generative models. Inspired by James P. Carse's distinction between finite and infinite games, we leverage recent advances in generative AI to create Unbounded: a game of character life simulation that is fully encapsulated in generative models. Specifically, Unbounded draws inspiration from sandbox life simulations and allows you to interact with your autonomous virtual character in a virtual world by feeding, playing with and guiding it - with open-ended mechanics generated by an LLM, some of which can be emergent. In order to develop Unbounded, we propose technical innovations in both the LLM and visual generation domains. Specifically, we present: (1) a specialized, distilled large language model (LLM) that dynamically generates game mechanics, narratives, and character interactions in real-time, and (2) a new dynamic regional image prompt Adapter (IP-Adapter) for vision models that ensures consistent yet flexible visual generation of a character across multiple environments. We evaluate our system through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, showing significant improvements in character life simulation, user instruction following, narrative coherence, and visual consistency for both characters and the environments compared to traditional related approaches."
Poster,Uncertainty and Influence aware Reward Model Refinement for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28685,"Zexu Sun, Yiju Guo, Yankai Lin, Xu Chen, Qi Qi, Xing Tang, xiuqiang He, Ji-Rong Wen","Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a standard and effective approach for training large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. In this framework, a learned reward model approximates human preferences and guides policy optimization, making it crucial to develop an accurate reward model. However, without the ``true'' reward function, challenges arise when the reward model is an imperfect proxy for human preference. Since the policy optimization continuously shifts the human preference training dataset's distribution. The fixed reward model suffers from this problem of off-distribution, especially the on policy methods. While collecting new preference data can mitigate this issue, it is costly and challenging to optimize. Thus, reusing the policy interaction samples becomes a possible way to further refine the reward model. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel method \textbf{U}ncertainty-\textbf{G}radient based \textbf{D}ata \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{UGDA} for short) to enhance reward modeling by leveraging policy samples to maintain on-distribution performance. Specifically, UGDA selects interaction samples based on the uncertainty of the reward ensembles and the gradient based influence of policy optimization. After the reward relabeling of selected samples, we use supervised learning to refine the reward ensembles, then get the retrained policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by leveraging UGDA to select a few samples without the costly human preference data collection, we can improve the ability of the policy and surpass the state-of-the-art methods."
Poster,Uncertainty-Aware Decoding with Minimum Bayes Risk,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28763,"Nico Daheim, Clara Meister, Thomas Möllenhoff, Iryna Gurevych","Despite their outstanding performance in the majority of scenarios, contemporary language models still occasionally generate undesirable outputs, for example, hallucinated text. While such behaviors have previously been linked to uncertainty, there is a notable lack of methods that actively consider uncertainty during text generation. In this work, we show how Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding, which selects model generations according to an expected risk, can be generalized into a principled uncertainty-aware decoding method. In short, we account for model uncertainty during decoding by incorporating a posterior over model parameters into MBR’s computation of expected risk. We show that this modified expected risk is useful for both choosing outputs and deciding when to abstain from generation and can provide improvements without incurring overhead. We benchmark different methods for learning posteriors and show that performance improves with prediction diversity. We release our code publicly."
Poster,Uncertainty Herding: One Active Learning Method for All Label Budgets,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29463,"Wonho Bae, Danica Sutherland, Gabriel Oliveira","Most active learning research has focused on methods which perform well when many labels are available, but can be dramatically worse than random selection when label budgets are small.Other methods have focused on the low-budget regime, but do poorly as label budgets increase.As the line between ""low"" and ""high"" budgets varies by problem,this is a serious issue in practice.We propose *uncertainty coverage*,an objective which generalizes a variety of low- and high-budget objectives,as well as natural, hyperparameter-light methods to smoothly interpolate between low- and high-budget regimes.We call greedy optimization of the estimate Uncertainty Herding;this simple method is computationally fast,and we prove that it nearly optimizes the distribution-level coverage.In experimental validation across a variety of active learning tasks,our proposal matches or beats state-of-the-art performance in essentially all cases;it is the only method of which we are aware that reliably works well in both low- and high-budget settings."
Poster,Uncertainty modeling for fine-tuned implicit functions,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28687,"Anna Susmelj, Mael Macuglia, Natasa Tagasovska, Reto Sutter, Sebastiano Caprara, Jean-Philippe Thiran, Ender Konukoglu","Implicit functions such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), occupancy networks, and signed distance functions (SDFs) have become pivotal in computer vision for reconstructing detailed object shapes from sparse views. Achieving optimal performance with these models can be challenging due to the extreme sparsity of inputs and distribution shifts induced by data corruptions. To this end, large, noise-free synthetic datasets can serve as shape priors to help models fill in gaps, but the resulting reconstructions must be approached with caution. Uncertainty estimation is crucial for assessing the quality of these reconstructions, particularly in identifying areas where the model is uncertain about the parts it has inferred from the prior. In this paper, we introduce Dropsembles, a novel method for uncertainty estimation in tuned implicit functions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a series of experiments, starting with toy examples and progressing to a real-world scenario. Specifically, we train a Convolutional Occupancy Network on synthetic anatomical data and test it on low-resolution MRI segmentations of the lumbar spine. Our results show that Dropsembles achieve the accuracy and calibration levels of deep ensembles but with significantly less computational cost."
Poster,Uncertainty Modeling in Graph Neural Networks via Stochastic Differential Equations,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29534,"Richard Bergna, Sergio Calvo Ordoñez, Felix Opolka, Pietro Lio, José Miguel Hernández Lobato","We propose a novel Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) framework to address the problem of learning uncertainty-aware representations for graph-structured data. While Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (GNODEs) have shown promise in learning node representations, they lack the ability to quantify uncertainty. To address this, we introduce Latent Graph Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (LGNSDE), which enhance GNODE by embedding randomness through a Bayesian prior-posterior mechanism for epistemic uncertainty and Brownian motion for aleatoric uncertainty. By leveraging the existence and uniqueness of solutions to graph-based SDEs, we prove that the variance of the latent space bounds the variance of model outputs, thereby providing theoretically sensible guarantees for the uncertainty estimates. Furthermore, we show mathematically that LGNSDEs are robust to small perturbations in the input, maintaining stability over time. Empirical results across several benchmarks demonstrate that our framework is competitive in out-of-distribution detection, robustness to noise perturbations, and active learning, underscoring the ability of LGNSDEs to quantify uncertainty reliably."
Poster,Uncovering Gaps in How Humans and LLMs Interpret Subjective Language,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28791,"Erik Jones, Arjun Patrawala, Jacob Steinhardt","Humans often rely on subjective natural language to direct language models (LLMs); for example, users might instruct the LLM to write an *enthusiastic* blogpost, while developers might train models to be *helpful* and *harmless* using LLM-based edits. The LLM’s *operational semantics* of such subjective phrases---how it adjusts its behavior when each phrase is included in the prompt---thus dictates how aligned it is with human intent. In this work, we uncover instances of *misalignment* between LLMs' actual operational semantics and what humans expect. Our method, TED (thesaurus error detector), first constructs a thesaurus that captures whether two phrases have similar operational semantics according to the LLM. It then elicits failures by unearthing disagreements between this thesaurus and a human-constructed reference. TED routinely produces surprising instances of misalignment; for example, Mistral 7B Instruct produces more *harassing* outputs when it edits text to be *witty*, and Llama 3 8B Instruct produces *dishonest* articles when instructed to make the articles *enthusiastic*. Our results demonstrate that humans can uncover unexpected LLM behavior by scrutinizing relationships between abstract concepts, without supervising outputs directly."
Poster,Uncovering Latent Memories in Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30058,"Sunny Duan, Mikail Khona, Abhiram Iyer, Rylan Schaeffer, Ila Fiete","Frontier AI systems are making transformative impacts across society, but such benefits are not without costs: models trained on web-scale datasets containing personal and private data raise profound concerns about data privacy and security. Language models are trained on extensive corpora including potentially sensitive or proprietary information, and the risk of data leakage, where the model response reveals pieces of such information, remains inadequately understood. Prior work has investigated that sequence complexity and the number of repetitions are the primary drivers of memorization. In this work, we examine the most vulnerable class of data: highly complex sequences that are presented only once during training. These sequences often contain the most sensitive information and pose considerable risk if memorized. By analyzing the progression of memorization for these sequences throughout training, we uncover a striking observation: many memorized sequences persist in the model's memory, exhibiting resistance to catastrophic forgetting even after just one encounter. Surprisingly, these sequences may not appear memorized immediately after their first exposure but can later be “uncovered” during training, even in the absence of subsequent exposures - a phenomenon we call ""latent memorization."" Latent memorization presents a serious challenge for data privacy, as sequences that seem hidden at the final checkpoint of a model may still be easily recoverable. We demonstrate how these hidden sequences can be revealed through random weight perturbations, and we introduce a diagnostic test based on cross-entropy loss to accurately identify latent memorized sequences."
Poster,Uncovering Overfitting in Large Language Model Editing,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28074,"Mengqi Zhang, Xiaotian Ye, Qiang Liu, shu wu, Pengjie Ren, Zhumin Chen","Knowledge editing has been proposed as an effective method for updating and correcting the internal knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing editing methods often struggle with complex tasks, such as multi-hop reasoning. In this paper, we identify and investigate the phenomenon of Editing Overfit, where edited models assign disproportionately high probabilities to the edit target, hindering the generalization of new knowledge in complex scenarios. We attribute this issue to the current editing paradigm, which places excessive emphasis on the direct correspondence between the input prompt and the edit target for each edit sample. To further explore this issue, we introduce a new benchmark, EVOKE (EValuation of Editing Overfit in Knowledge Editing), along with fine-grained evaluation metrics. Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that Editing Overfit is prevalent in current editing methods and that common overfitting mitigation strategies are ineffective in knowledge editing. To overcome this, inspired by LLMs’ knowledge recall mechanisms, we propose a new plug-and-play strategy called Learn the Inference (LTI), which introduce a Multi-stage Inference Constraint module to guide the edited models in recalling new knowledge similarly to how unedited LLMs leverage knowledge through in-context learning. Extensive experimental results across a wide range of tasks validate the effectiveness of LTI in mitigating Editing Overfit."
Poster,Underdamped Diffusion Bridges with Applications to Sampling,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29713,"Denis Blessing, Julius Berner, Lorenz Richter, Gerhard Neumann","We provide a general framework for learning diffusion bridges that transport prior to target distributions. It includes existing diffusion models for generative modeling, but also underdamped versions with degenerate diffusion matrices, where the noise only acts in certain dimensions. Extending previous findings, our framework allows to rigorously show that score-matching in the underdamped case is indeed equivalent to maximizing a lower bound on the likelihood. Motivated by superior convergence properties and compatibility with sophisticated numerical integration schemes of underdamped stochastic processes, we propose *underdamped diffusion bridges*, where a general density evolution is learned rather than prescribed by a fixed noising process. We apply our method to the challenging task of sampling from unnormalized densities without access to samples from the target distribution. Across a diverse range of sampling problems, our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, notably outperforming alternative methods, while requiring significantly fewer discretization steps and almost no hyperparameter tuning."
