Poster,SynQ: Accurate Zero-shot Quantization by Synthesis-aware Fine-tuning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31109,"Minjun Kim, Jongjin Kim, U Kang","How can we accurately quantize a pre-trained model without any data?Quantization algorithms are widely used for deploying neural networks on resource-constrained edge devices.Zero-shot Quantization (ZSQ) addresses the crucial and practical scenario where training data are inaccessible for privacy or security reasons.However, three significant challenges hinder the performance of existing ZSQ methods: 1) noise in the synthetic dataset, 2) predictions based on off-target patterns, and the 3) misguidance by erroneous hard labels.In this paper, we propose SynQ (Synthesis-aware Fine-tuning for Zero-shot Quantization),a carefully designed ZSQ framework to overcome the limitations of existing methods.SynQ minimizes the noise from the generated samples by exploiting a low-pass filter.Then, SynQ trains the quantized model to improve accuracy by aligning its class activation map with the pre-trained model.Furthermore, SynQ mitigates misguidance from the pre-trained model's error by leveraging only soft labels for difficult samples.Extensive experiments show that SynQ provides the state-of-the-art accuracy, over existing ZSQ methods."
Poster,Syntactic and Semantic Control of Large Language Models via Sequential Monte Carlo,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27761,"João Loula, Benjamin LeBrun, Li Du, Ben Lipkin, Clemente Pasti, Gabriel Grand, Tianyu Liu, Yahya Emara, Marjorie Freedman, Jason Eisner, Ryan Cotterell, Vikash Mansinghka, Alexander Lew, Tim Vieira, Timothy O&#x27;Donnell","A wide range of LM applications require generating text that conforms to syntactic or semantic constraints. Imposing such constraints can be naturally framed as _probabilistic conditioning_, but exact generation from the resulting distribution—which can differ substantially from the LM’s base distribution—is generally intractable. In this work,we develop an architecture for controlled LM generation based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). Our SMC framework allows us to flexibly incorporate domain- and problem-specific constraints at inference time, and efficiently reallocate computational resources in light of new information during the course of generation. By comparing to a number of alternatives and ablations on four challenging domains---Python code generation for data science, text-to-SQL, goal inference, and molecule synthesis—we demonstrate that, with little overhead, our approach allows small open-source language models to outperform models over 8$\times$ larger, as well as closed-source, fine-tuned ones. In support of the probabilistic perspective, we show that these performance improvements are driven by better approximation to the posterior distribution. [Our system](https://github.com/probcomp/genlm-control) builds on the framework of Lew et al. (2023) and integrates with its _language model probabilistic programming language_, giving users a simple, programmable way to apply SMC to a broad variety of controlled generation problems."
Poster,Synthesizing Programmatic Reinforcement Learning Policies with Large Language Model Guided Search,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30780,"Max Liu, Chan-Hung Yu, Wei-Hsu Lee, Cheng-Wei Hung, Yen-Chun Chen, Shao-Hua Sun","Programmatic reinforcement learning (PRL) has been explored for representing policies through programs as a means to achieve interpretability and generalization. Despite promising outcomes, current state-of-the-art PRL methods are hindered by sample inefficiency, necessitating tens of millions of program-environment interactions. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel LLM-guided search framework (LLM-GS). Our key insight is to leverage the programming expertise and common sense reasoning of LLMs to enhance the efficiency of assumption-free, random-guessing search methods. We address the challenge of LLMs' inability to generate precise and grammatically correct programs in domain-specific languages (DSLs) by proposing a Pythonic-DSL strategy — an LLM is instructed to initially generate Python codes and then convert them into DSL programs. To further optimize the LLM-generated programs, we develop a search algorithm named Scheduled Hill Climbing, designed to efficiently explore the programmatic search space to improve the programs consistently. Experimental results in the Karel domain demonstrate our LLM-GS framework's superior effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive ablation studies further verify the critical role of our Pythonic-DSL strategy and Scheduled Hill Climbing algorithm. Moreover, we conduct experiments with two novel tasks, showing that LLM-GS enables users without programming skills and knowledge of the domain or DSL to describe the tasks in natural language to obtain performant programs."
Poster,Synthesizing Realistic fMRI: A Physiological Dynamics-Driven Hierarchical Diffusion Model for Efficient fMRI Acquisition,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27664,"Yufan Hu, Jiang, Wuyang Li, Yixuan Yuan","Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is essential for mapping brain activity but faces challenges like lengthy acquisition time and sensitivity to patient movement, limiting its clinical and machine learning applications. While generative models such as diffusion models can synthesize fMRI signals to alleviate these issues, they often underperform due to neglecting the brain's complex structural and dynamic properties.To address these limitations, we propose the Physiological Dynamics-Driven Hierarchical Diffusion Model, a novel framework integrating two key brain physiological properties into the diffusion process: brain hierarchical regional interactions and multifractal dynamics. To model complex interactions among brain regions, we construct hypergraphs based on the prior knowledge of brain functional parcellation reflected by resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC). This enables the aggregation of fMRI signals across multiple scales and generates hierarchical signals. Additionally, by incorporating the prediction of two key dynamics properties of fMRI—the multifractal spectrum and generalized Hurst exponent—our framework effectively guides the diffusion process, ensuring the preservation of the scale-invariant characteristics inherent in real fMRI data.Our framework employs progressive diffusion generation, with signals representing broader brain region information conditioning those that capture localized details, and unifies multiple inputs during denoising for balanced integration.Experiments demonstrate that our model generates physiologically realistic fMRI signals, potentially reducing acquisition time and enhancing data quality, benefiting clinical diagnostics and machine learning in neuroscience."
Poster,Synthetic continued pretraining,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31270,"Zitong Yang, Neil Band, Shuangping Li, Emmanuel Candes, Tatsunori Hashimoto","Pretraining on large-scale, unstructured internet text enables language models to acquire a significant amount of world knowledge.However, this knowledge acquisition is data-inefficient---to learn a fact, models must be trained on hundreds to thousands of diverse representations of it.This poses a challenge when adapting a pretrained model to a small corpus of domain-specific documents, where each fact may appear rarely or only once.We propose to bridge this gap with synthetic continued pretraining: using the small domain-specific corpus to synthesize a large corpus more amenable to learning, and then performing continued pretraining on the synthesized corpus.We instantiate this proposal with EntiGraph, a synthetic data augmentation algorithm that extracts salient entities from the source corpus and then generates diverse text by drawing connections between those entities.Synthetic continued pretraining with EntiGraph enables a language model to answer questions and follow generic instructions related to the source documents without access to them.If the source documents are instead available at inference time, we show that the knowledge acquired through our approach compounds with retrieval-augmented generation.To better understand these results, we build a simple mathematical model of EntiGraph, and show how synthetic data augmentation can ""rearrange"" knowledge to enable more data-efficient learning."
Poster,Synthio: Augmenting Small-Scale Audio Classification Datasets with Synthetic Data,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29111,"Sreyan Ghosh, Sonal Kumar, Zhifeng Kong, Rafael Valle, Bryan Catanzaro, Dinesh Manocha","We present Synthio, a novel approach for augmenting small-scale audio classification datasets with synthetic data. Our goal is to improve audio classification accuracy with limited labeled data. Traditional data augmentation techniques, which apply artificial transformations (e.g., adding random noise or masking segments), struggle to create data that captures the true diversity present in real-world audios. To address this shortcoming, we propose to augment the dataset with synthetic audio generated from text-to-audio (T2A) diffusion models. However, synthesizing effective augmentations is challenging because not only should the generated data be acoustically consistent with the underlying small-scale dataset, but they should also have sufficient compositional diversity. To overcome the first challenge, we align the generations of the T2A model with the small-scale dataset using preference optimization. This ensures that the acoustic characteristics of the generated data remain consistent with the small-scale dataset. To address the second challenge, we propose a novel caption generation technique that leverages the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models to (1) generate diverse and meaningful audio captions and (2) iteratively refine their quality. The generated captions are then used to prompt the aligned T2A model. We extensively evaluate Synthio on ten datasets and four simulated limited-data settings. Results indicate our method consistently outperforms all baselines by 0.1%-39% using a T2A model trained only on weakly-captioned AudioSet."
Poster,SysBench: Can LLMs Follow System Message?,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30048,"Yanzhao Qin, Tao Zhang, Tao Zhang, Yanjun Shen, Wenjing Luo, sunhaoze, Yan Zhang, Yujing Qiao, Weipeng Chen, Zenan Zhou, Wentao Zhang, Bin CUI","Large Language Models (LLMs) have become instrumental across various applications, with the customization of these models to specific scenarios becoming increasingly critical. System message, a fundamental component of LLMs, is consist of carefully crafted instructions that guide the behavior of model to meet intended goals. Despite the recognized potential of system messages to optimize AI-driven solutions,  there is a notable absence of a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how well LLMs follow system messages. To fill this gap, we introduce SysBench, a benchmark that systematically analyzes system message following ability in terms of three limitations of existing LLMs: constraint violation, instruction misjudgement and multi-turn instability. Specifically, we manually construct evaluation dataset based on six prevalent types of constraints, including 500 tailor-designed system messages and multi-turn user conversations covering various interaction relationships. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive evaluation protocol to measure model performance. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluation across various existing LLMs, measuring their ability to follow specified constraints given in system messages. The results highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of existing models, offering key insights and directions for future research."
Poster,SysCaps: Language Interfaces for Simulation Surrogates of Complex Systems,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31201,"Patrick Emami, Zhaonan Li, Saumya Sinha, Truc Nguyen","Surrogate models are used to predict the behavior of complex energy systems that are too expensive to simulate with traditional numerical methods. Our work introduces the use of language descriptions, which we call ""system captions"" or SysCaps, to interface with such surrogates. We argue that interacting with surrogates through text, particularly natural language, makes these models more accessible for both experts and non-experts.We introduce a lightweight multimodal text and timeseries regression model and a training pipeline that uses large language models (LLMs) to synthesize high-quality captions from simulation metadata. Our experiments on two real-world simulators of buildings and wind farms show that our SysCaps-augmented surrogates have better accuracy on held-out systems than traditional methods while enjoying new generalization abilities, such as handling semantically related descriptions of the same test system.Additional experiments also highlight the potential of SysCaps to unlock language-driven design space exploration and to regularize training through prompt augmentation."
Poster,System 1.x: Learning to Balance Fast and Slow Planning with Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27660,"Swarnadeep Saha, Archiki Prasad, Justin Chen, Peter Hase, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal","Language models can be used to solve long-horizon planning problems in two distinct modes. In a fast 'System-1' mode, models directly generate plans without any explicit search or backtracking, and in a slow 'System-2' mode, they plan step-by-step by explicitly searching over possible actions. System-2 planning, while typically more effective, is also computationally more expensive and often infeasible for long plans or large action spaces. Moreover, isolated System-1 or System-2 planning ignores the user's end goals and constraints (e.g., token budget), failing to provide ways for the user to control the model's behavior. To this end, we propose the System-1.x Planner, a framework for controllable planning with language models that is capable of generating hybrid plans and balancing between the two planning modes based on the difficulty of the problem at hand. System-1.x consists of (i) a controller, (ii) a System-1 Planner, and (iii) a System-2 Planner. Based on a user-specified hybridization factor x governing the degree to which the system uses System-1 vs. System-2, the controller decomposes a planning problem into subgoals, and classifies them as easy or hard to be solved by either System-1 or System-2, respectively. We fine-tune all three components on top of a single base LLM, requiring only search traces as supervision. Experiments with two diverse planning tasks -- Maze Navigation and Blocksworld -- show that our System-1.x Planner outperforms a System-1 Planner, a System-2 Planner trained to approximate A* search, and also a symbolic planner (A* search), given a state exploration budget. We also demonstrate the following key properties of our planner: (1) controllability: by adjusting the hybridization factor x (e.g., System-1.75 vs. System-1.5) we can perform more (or less) search, improving performance, (2) flexibility: by building a neuro-symbolic variant composed of a neural System-1 planner and a symbolic System-2 planner, we can take advantage of existing symbolic methods, and (3) generalizability: by learning from different search algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*), we show that our method is robust to the choice of search algorithm used for training."
Poster,Systematic Outliers in Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28203,"Yongqi An, Xu Zhao, Tao Yu, Ming Tang, Jinqiao Wang","Outliers have been widely observed in Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly impacting model performance and posing challenges for model compression. Understanding the functionality and formation mechanisms of these outliers is critically important. Existing works, however, largely focus on reducing the impact of outliers from an algorithmic perspective, lacking an in-depth investigation into their causes and roles. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the formation process, underlying causes, and functions of outliers in LLMs. We define and categorize three types of outliers—activation outliers, weight outliers, and attention outliers—and analyze their distributions across different dimensions, uncovering inherent connections between their occurrences and their ultimate influence on the attention mechanism. Based on these observations, we hypothesize and explore the mechanisms by which these outliers arise and function, demonstrating through theoretical derivations and experiments that they emerge due to the self-attention mechanism's softmax operation. These outliers act as implicit context-aware scaling factors within the attention mechanism. As these outliers stem from systematic influences, we term them systematic outliers. Our study not only enhances the understanding of Transformer-based LLMs but also shows that structurally eliminating outliers can accelerate convergence and improve model compression.
