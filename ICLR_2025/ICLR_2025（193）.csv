Poster,Let Your Features Tell The Differences: Understanding Graph Convolution By Feature Splitting,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30186,"Yilun Zheng, Xiang Li, Sitao Luan, Xiaojiang Peng, Lihui Chen","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in processing structured data. While traditional GNNs typically treat each feature dimension equally important during graph convolution, we raise an important question: **Is the graph convolution operation equally beneficial for each feature?** If not, the convolution operation on certain feature dimensions can possibly lead to harmful effects, even worse than convolution-free models. Therefore, it is required to distinguish convolution-favored and convolution-disfavored features. Traditional feature selection methods mainly focus on identifying informative features or reducing redundancy, but they are not suitable for structured data as they overlook graph structures. In graph community, some studies have investigated the performance of GNN with respect to node features using feature homophily metrics, which assess feature consistency across graph topology. Unfortunately, these metrics do not effectively align with GNN performance and cannot be reliably used for feature selection in GNNs. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel metric, Topological Feature Informativeness (TFI), to distinguish GNN-favored and GNN-disfavored features, where its effectiveness is validated through both theoretical analysis and empirical observations. Based on TFI, we propose a simple yet effective Graph Feature Selection (GFS) method, which processes GNN-favored and GNN-disfavored features with GNNs and non-GNN models separately. Compared to original GNNs, GFS significantly improves the extraction of useful topological information from each feature with comparable computational costs. Extensive experiments show that after applying GFS to $\textbf{8}$ baseline and state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN architectures across $\textbf{10}$ datasets, $\textbf{90\%}$ of the GFS-augmented cases show significant performance boosts. Furthermore, our proposed TFI metric outperforms other feature selection methods for GFS. These results verify the effectiveness of both GFS and TFI. Additionally, we demonstrate that GFS's improvements are robust to hyperparameter tuning, highlighting its potential as a universally valid method for enhancing various GNN architectures."
Poster,"LevAttention: Time, Space and Streaming Efficient Algorithm for Heavy Attentions",https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30728,"Ravindran Kannan, Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, Praneeth Kacham, David Woodruff","A central problem related to transformers can be stated as follows: given two $n \times d$ matrices $Q$ and $K$, and a non-negative function $f$, define the matrix $A$ as follows: (1) apply the function $f$ to each entry of the $n \times n$ matrix $Q K^T$, and then (2) normalize each of the row sums of $A$ to be equal to $1$. The matrix $A$ can be computed in $O(n^2 d)$ time assuming $f$ can be applied to a number in constant time, but the quadratic dependence on $n$ is prohibitive in applications where it corresponds to long context lengths. For a large class of functions $f$, we show how to find all the ""large attention scores"", i.e., entries of $A$ which are at least a positive value $\varepsilon$, in time with linear dependence on $n$ (i.e., $n \cdot \textrm{poly}(d/\varepsilon)$) for a positive parameter $\varepsilon > 0$. Our class of functions include all functions $f$ of the form $f(x) = |x|^p$, as explored recently in transformer models. Using recently developed tools from randomized numerical linear algebra, we prove that for any $K$, there is a ""universal set"" $U \subset [n]$ of size independent of $n$, such that for any $Q$ and any row $i$, the large attention scores $A_{i,j}$ in row $i$ of $A$ all have $j \in U$. We also find $U$ in $n \cdot \textrm{poly}(d/\varepsilon)$ time. Notably, we (1) make no assumptions on the data, (2) our workspace does not grow with $n$, and (3) our algorithms can be computed in streaming and parallel settings. We empirically show the benefits of our scheme for vision transformers, showing how to train new models that use our universal set while training as well, showing that our model is able to consistently select ""important keys'"" during training. We also provide theoretical motivation by formulating a planted model in which our efficient algorithms provably identify relevant keys for each query."
Poster,Leveraging Driver Field-of-View for Multimodal Ego-Trajectory Prediction,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30006,"M. Eren Akbiyik, Nedko Savov, Danda Pani Paudel, Nikola Popovic, Christian Vater, Otmar Hilliges, Luc Van Gool, Xi Wang","Understanding drivers’ decision-making is crucial for road safety. Although predicting the ego-vehicle’s path is valuable for driver-assistance systems, existing methods mainly focus on external factors like other vehicles’ motions, often neglecting the driver’s attention and intent. To address this gap, we infer the ego-trajectory by integrating the driver’s gaze and the surrounding scene. We introduce RouteFormer, a novel multimodal ego-trajectory prediction network combining GPS data, environmental context, and the driver's field-of-view—comprising first-person video and gaze fixations. We also present the Path Complexity Index (PCI), a new metric for trajectory complexity that enables a more nuanced evaluation of challenging scenarios. To tackle data scarcity and enhance diversity, we introduce GEM, a comprehensive dataset of urban driving scenarios enriched with synchronized driver field-of-view and gaze data. Extensive evaluations on GEM and DR(eye)VE demonstrate that RouteFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving notable improvements in prediction accuracy across diverse conditions. Ablation studies reveal that incorporating driver field-of-view data yields significantly better average displacement error, especially in challenging scenarios with high PCI scores, underscoring the importance of modeling driver attention. All data and code are available at meakbiyik.github.io/routeformer."
Poster,Leveraging Flatness to Improve Information-Theoretic Generalization Bounds for SGD,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28297,"Ze Peng, Jian Zhang, Yisen Wang, Lei Qi, Yinghuan Shi, Yang Gao","Information-theoretic (IT) generalization bounds have been used to study the generalization of learning algorithms. These bounds are intrinsically data- and algorithm-dependent so that one can exploit the properties of data and algorithm to derive tighter bounds. However, we observe that although the flatness bias is crucial for SGD’s generalization, these bounds fail to capture the improved generalization under better flatness and are also numerically loose. This is caused by the inadequate leverage of SGD's flatness bias in existing IT bounds. This paper derives a more flatness-leveraging IT bound for the flatness-favoring SGD. The bound indicates the learned models generalize better if the large-variance directions of the final weight covariance have small local curvatures in the loss landscape. Experiments on deep neural networks show our bound not only correctly reflects the better generalization when flatness is improved, but is also numerically much tighter. This is achieved by a flexible technique called ""omniscient trajectory"". When applied to Gradient Descent’s minimax excess risk on convex-Lipschitz-Bounded problems, it improves representative IT bounds’ $\Omega(1)$ rates to $O(1/\sqrt{n})$. It also implies a by-pass of memorization-generalization trade-offs. Codes are available at [https://github.com/peng-ze/omniscient-bounds](https://github.com/peng-ze/omniscient-bounds)."
Poster,Leveraging Submodule Linearity Enhances Task Arithmetic Performance in LLMs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28670,"Rui Dai, Sile Hu, Xu Shen, Yonggang Zhang, Xinmei Tian, Jieping Ye","Task arithmetic is a straightforward yet highly effective strategy for model merging, enabling the resultant model to exhibit multi-task capabilities. Recent research indicates that models demonstrating linearity enhance the performance of task arithmetic. In contrast to existing methods that rely on the global linearization of the model, we argue that this linearity already exists within the model's submodules. In particular, we present a statistical analysis and show that submodules (e.g., layers, self-attentions, and MLPs) exhibit significantly higher linearity than the overall model. Based on these findings, we propose an innovative model merging strategy that independently merges these submodules. Especially, we derive a closed-form solution for optimal merging weights grounded in the linear properties of these submodules. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the standard task arithmetic approach and other established baselines across different model scales and various tasks. This result highlights the benefits of leveraging the linearity of submodules and provides a new perspective for exploring solutions for effective and practical multi-task model merging."
Poster,Leveraging Sub-Optimal Data for Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30457,"Calarina Muslimani, Matthew E Taylor","To create useful reinforcement learning (RL) agents, step zero is to design a suitable reward function that captures the nuances of the task. However, reward engineering can be a difficult and time-consuming process.  Instead, human-in-the-loop RL methods hold the promise of learning reward functions from human feedback. Despite recent successes, many of the human-in-the-loop RL methods still require numerous human interactions to learn successful reward functions.To improve the feedback efficiency of human-in-the-loop RL methods (i.e., require less human interaction), this paper introduces Sub-optimal Data Pre-training, SDP, an approach that leverages reward-free, sub-optimal data to improve scalar- and preference-based RL algorithms. In SDP, we start by pseudo-labeling all low-quality data with the minimum environment reward. Through this process, we obtain reward labels to pre-train our reward model without requiring human labeling or preferences. This pre-training phase provides the reward model a head start in learning, enabling it to recognize that low-quality transitions should be assigned low rewards. Through extensive experiments with both simulated and human teachers, we find that SDP can at least meet, but often significantly improve, state of the art human-in-the-loop RL performance across a variety of simulated robotic tasks."
Poster,Leveraging Variable Sparsity to Refine Pareto Stationarity in Multi-Objective Optimization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30551,"Zeou Hu, Yaoliang Yu","Gradient-based multi-objective optimization (MOO) is essential in modern machine learning, with applications in e.g., multi-task learning, federated learning,  algorithmic fairness and reinforcement learning. In this work, we first reveal some limitations of Pareto stationarity, a widely accepted first-order condition for Pareto optimality, in the presence of sparse function-variable structures. Next, to account for such sparsity, we propose a novel solution concept termed Refined Pareto Stationarity (RPS), which we prove is always sandwiched between Pareto optimality and Pareto stationarity. We give an efficient partitioning algorithm to automatically mine the function-variable dependency and substantially trim non-optimal Pareto stationary solutions. Then, we show that gradient-based descent algorithms in MOO can be enhanced with our refined partitioning. In particular, we propose Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm with Refined Partition (RP-MGDA) as an example method that converges to RPS, while still enjoying a similar per-step complexity and convergence rate. Lastly, we validate our approach through experiments on both synthetic examples and realistic application scenarios where distinct function-variable dependency structures appear. Our results highlight the importance of exploiting function-variable structure in gradient-based MOO, and provide a seamless enhancement to existing approaches."
Poster,LICO: Large Language Models for In-Context Molecular Optimization,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27698,"Tung Nguyen, Aditya Grover","Optimizing black-box functions is a fundamental problem in science and engineering. To solve this problem, many approaches learn a surrogate function that estimates the underlying objective from limited historical evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong pattern-matching capabilities via pretraining on vast amounts of data, stand out as a potential candidate for surrogate modeling. However, directly prompting a pretrained language model to produce predictions is not feasible in many scientific domains due to the scarcity of domain-specific data in the pretraining corpora and the challenges of articulating complex problems in natural language. In this work, we introduce LICO, a general-purpose model that extends arbitrary base LLMs for black-box optimization, with a particular application to the molecular domain. To achieve this, we equip the language model with a separate embedding layer and prediction layer, and train the model to perform in-context predictions on a diverse set of functions defined over the domain. Once trained, LICO can generalize to unseen molecule properties simply via in-context prompting. LICO performs competitively on PMO, a challenging molecular optimization benchmark comprising 23 objective functions, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on its low-budget version PMO-1K."
Poster,LICORICE: Label-Efficient Concept-Based Interpretable Reinforcement Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29920,"Zhuorui Ye, Stephanie Milani, Geoff Gordon, Fei Fang","Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have predominantly leveraged neural network policies for decision-making, yet these models often lack interpretability, posing challenges for stakeholder comprehension and trust. Concept bottleneck models offer an interpretable alternative by integrating human-understandable concepts into policies. However, prior work assumes that concept annotations are readily available during training. For RL, this requirement poses a significant limitation: it necessitates continuous real-time concept annotation, which either places an impractical burden on human annotators or incurs substantial costs in API queries and inference time when employing automated labeling methods. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel training scheme that enables RL agents to efficiently learn a concept-based policy by only querying annotators to label a small set of data. Our algorithm, LICORICE, involves three main contributions: interleaving concept learning and RL training, using an ensemble to actively select informative data points for labeling, and decorrelating the concept data. We show how LICORICE reduces human labeling efforts to 500 or fewer concept labels in three environments, and 5000 or fewer in two more complex environments, all at no cost to performance. We also explore the use of VLMs as automated concept annotators, finding them effective in some cases but imperfect in others. Our work significantly reduces the annotation burden for interpretable RL, making it more practical for real-world applications that necessitate transparency. Our code is released."
Poster,Lie Algebra Canonicalization: Equivariant Neural Operators under arbitrary Lie Groups,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30825,"Zakhar Shumaylov, Peter Zaika, James Rowbottom, Ferdia Sherry, Melanie Weber, Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb","The quest for robust and generalizable machine learning models has driven recent interest in exploiting symmetries through equivariant neural networks. In the context of PDE solvers, recent works have shown that Lie point symmetries can be a useful inductive bias for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) through data and loss augmentation. Despite this, directly enforcing equivariance within the model architecture for these problems remains elusive. This is because many PDEs admit non-compact symmetry groups, oftentimes not studied beyond their infinitesimal generators, making them incompatible with most existing equivariant architectures. In this work, we propose Lie aLgebrA Canonicalization (LieLAC), a novel approach that exploits only the action of infinitesimal generators of the symmetry group, circumventing the need for knowledge of the full group structure. To achieve this, we address existing theoretical issues in the canonicalization literature, establishing connections with frame averaging in the case of continuous non-compact groups. Operating within the framework of canonicalization, LieLAC can easily be integrated with unconstrained pre-trained models, transforming inputs to a canonical form before feeding them into the existing model, effectively aligning the input for model inference according to allowed symmetries. LieLAC utilizes standard Lie group descent schemes, achieving equivariance in pre-trained models. Finally, we showcase LieLAC's efficacy on tasks of invariant image classification and Lie point symmetry equivariant neural PDE solvers using pre-trained models."
