Poster,ImDy: Human Inverse Dynamics from Imitated Observations,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29085,"Xinpeng Liu, Junxuan Liang, Zili Lin, Haowen Hou, Yong-Lu Li, Cewu Lu","Inverse dynamics (ID), which aims at reproducing the driven torques from human kinematic observations, has been a critical tool for gait analysis. However, it is hindered from wider application to general motion due to its limited scalability. Conventional optimization-based ID requires expensive laboratory setups, restricting its availability. To alleviate this problem, we propose to exploit the recently progressive human motion imitation algorithms to learn human inverse dynamics in a data-driven manner. The key insight is that the human ID knowledge is implicitly possessed by motion imitators, though not directly applicable. In light of this, we devise an efficient data collection pipeline with state-of-the-art motion imitation algorithms and physics simulators, resulting in a large-scale human inverse dynamics benchmark as Imitated Dynamics (ImDy). ImDy contains over 150 hours of motion with joint torque and full-body ground reaction force data. With ImDy, we train a data-driven human inverse dynamics solver ImDyS(olver) in a fully supervised manner, which conducts ID and ground reaction force estimation simultaneously. Experiments on ImDy and real-world data demonstrate the impressive competency of ImDyS in human inverse dynamics and ground reaction force estimation. Moreover, the potential of ImDy(-S) as a fundamental motion analysis tool is exhibited with downstream applications. The project page is https://foruck.github.io/ImDy."
Poster,Immunogenicity Prediction with Dual Attention Enables Vaccine Target Selection,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28756,"Song Li, Yang Tan, Song Ke, liang hong, Bingxin Zhou","Immunogenicity prediction is a central topic in reverse vaccinology for finding candidate vaccines that can trigger protective immune responses. Existing approaches typically rely on highly compressed features and simple model architectures, leading to limited prediction accuracy and poor generalizability. To address these challenges, we introduce VenusVaccine, a novel deep learning solution with a dual attention mechanism that integrates pre-trained latent vector representations of protein sequences and structures. We also compile the most comprehensive immunogenicity dataset to date, encompassing over 7000 antigen sequences, structures, and immunogenicity labels from bacteria, viruses, and tumors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VenusVaccine outperforms existing methods across a wide range of evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we establish a post-hoc validation protocol to assess the practical significance of deep learning models in tackling vaccine design challenges. Our work provides an effective tool for vaccine design and sets valuable benchmarks for future research. The implementation is at \url{https://github.com/songleee/VenusVaccine}."
Poster,Implicit Bias of Mirror Flow for Shallow Neural Networks in Univariate Regression,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30180,"Shuang Liang, Guido Montufar","We examine the implicit bias of mirror flow in least squares error regression with wide and shallow neural networks. For a broad class of potential functions, we show that mirror flow exhibits lazy training and has the same implicit bias as ordinary gradient flow when the network width tends to infinity. For univariate ReLU networks, we characterize this bias through a variational problem in function space. Our analysis includes prior results for ordinary gradient flow as a special case and lifts limitations which required either an intractable adjustment of the training data or networks with skip connections. We further introduce \emph{scaled potentials} and show that for these, mirror flow still exhibits lazy training but is not in the kernel regime. For univariate networks with absolute value activations, we show that mirror flow with scaled potentials induces a rich class of biases, which generally cannot be captured by an RKHS norm. A takeaway is that whereas the parameter initialization determines how strongly the curvature of the learned function is penalized at different locations of the input space, the scaled potential determines how the different magnitudes of the curvature are penalized."
Poster,Implicit In-context Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30298,"Zhuowei Li, Zihao Xu, Ligong Han, Yunhe Gao, Song Wen, Di Liu, Hao Wang, Dimitris Metaxas","In-context Learning (ICL) empowers large language models (LLMs) to swiftly adapt to unseen tasks at inference-time by prefixing a few demonstration examples before queries. Despite its versatility, ICL incurs substantial computational and memory overheads compared to zero-shot learning and is sensitive to the selection and order of demonstration examples. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Implicit In-context Learning} (I2CL), an innovative paradigm that reduces the inference cost of ICL to that of zero-shot learning with minimal information loss. I2CL operates by first generating a condensed vector representation, namely a context vector, extracted from the demonstration examples. It then conducts an inference-time intervention through injecting a linear combination of the context vector and query activations back into the model’s residual streams. Empirical evaluation on nine real-world tasks across three model architectures demonstrates that I2CL achieves few-shot level performance at zero-shot inference cost, and it exhibits robustness against variations in demonstration examples. Furthermore, I2CL facilitates a novel representation of ``task-ids'', enhancing task similarity detection and fostering effective transfer learning. We also perform a comprehensive analysis and ablation study on I2CL, offering deeper insights into its internal mechanisms. Code is available at https://github.com/LzVv123456/I2CL."
Poster,Implicit Neural Surface Deformation with Explicit Velocity Fields,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28123,"Lu Sang, Zehranaz Canfes, Dongliang Cao, Florian Bernard, Daniel Cremers","In this work, we introduce the first unsupervised method that simultaneously predicts time-varying neural implicit surfaces and deformations between pairs of point clouds. We propose to model the point movement using an explicit velocity field and directly deform a time-varying implicit field using the modified level-set equation. This equation utilizes an iso-surface evolution with Eikonal constraints in a compact formulation, ensuring the integrity of the signed distance field. By applying a smooth, volume-preserving constraint to the velocity field, our method successfully recovers physically plausible intermediate shapes. Our method is able to handle both rigid and non-rigid deformations without any intermediate shape supervision. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing works, delivering superior results in both quality and efficiency."
Poster,Implicit Search via Discrete Diffusion: A Study on Chess,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30648,"Jiacheng Ye, Zhenyu Wu, Jiahui Gao, Zhiyong Wu, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Lingpeng Kong","In the post-AlphaGo era, there has been a renewed interest in search techniques such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), particularly in their application to Large Language Models (LLMs).This renewed attention is driven by the recognition that current next-token prediction models often lack the ability for long-term planning. Is it possible to instill search-like abilities within the models to enhance their planning abilities without relying on explicit search? We propose DiffuSearch , a model that does \textit{implicit search} by looking into the future world via discrete diffusion modeling. We instantiate DiffuSearch on a classical board game, Chess, where explicit search is known to be essential. Through extensive controlled experiments, we show DiffuSearch outperforms both the searchless and explicit search-enhanced policies. Specifically, DiffuSearch outperforms the one-step policy by 19.2\% and the MCTS-enhanced policy by 14\% on action accuracy. Furthermore, DiffuSearch demonstrates a notable 30\% enhancement in puzzle-solving abilities compared to explicit search-based policies, along with a significant 540 Elo increase in game-playing strength assessment. These results indicate that implicit search via discrete diffusion is a viable alternative to explicit search over a one-step policy.

Poster,Improved Algorithms for Kernel  Matrix-Vector Multiplication Under Sparsity Assumptions,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27853,"Piotr Indyk, Michael Kapralov, Kshiteej Jitesh Sheth, Tal Wagner","Motivated by the problem of fast processing of attention matrices, we study fast algorithms for computing matrix-vector products for asymmetric Gaussian Kernel matrices $K\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. $K$'s columns are indexed by a set of $n$ keys $k_1,k_2\ldots, k_n\in \mathbb{R}^d$, rows by a set of $n$ queries $q_1,q_2,\ldots,q_n\in \mathbb{R}^d $, and its $i,j$ entry is $K_{ij} = e^{-\|q_i-k_j\|_2^2/2\sigma^2}$ for some bandwidth parameter $\sigma>0$. Given a vector $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$ and error parameter $\epsilon>0$, our task is to output a $y\in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\|Kx-y\|_2\leq \epsilon \|x\|_2$ in time subquadratic in $n$ and linear in $d$. Our algorithms rely on the following modelling assumption about the matrices $K$: the sum of the entries of $K$ scales linearly in $n$, as opposed to worst case quadratic growth. We validate this assumption experimentally, for Gaussian kernel matrices encountered in various settings such as fast attention computation in LLMs. Under this assumption, we obtain the first subquadratic time algorithm for kernel matrix-vector multiplication for unrestricted vectors."
Poster,Improved Approximation Algorithms for $k$-Submodular Maximization via Multilinear Extension,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30407,"Huanjian Zhou, Lingxiao Huang, Baoxiang Wang","We investigate a generalized form of submodular maximization, referred to as $k$-submodular maximization, with applications across the domains of social networks and machine learning. In this work, we propose the multilinear extension of $k$-submodular functions and unified Frank-Wolfe-type frameworks based on that. This continuous framework accommodates 1) monotone or non-monotone functions, and 2) various constraint types including matroid constraints, knapsack constraints, and their combinations. Notably, we attain an asymptotically optimal $1/2$-approximation for monotone $k$-submodular maximization problems with knapsack constraints, surpassing previous $1/3$-approximation results, and a factor-$1/3$ approximation for non-monotone $k$-submodular maximization problems with knapsack constraints and matroid constraints which outperforms previous $0.245$-approximation results. The foundation for our analysis stems from new insights into specific linear and monotone properties pertaining to the multilinear extension."
Poster,Improved Convergence Rate for Diffusion Probabilistic Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29610,"Gen Li, Yuchen Jiao","Score-based diffusion models have achieved remarkable empirical performance in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence for their ability to generate high-quality new data instances from complex distributions. Improving our understanding of diffusion models, including mainly convergence analysis for such models, has attracted a lot of interests. Despite a lot of theoretical attempts, there still exists significant gap between theory and practice. Towards to close this gap, we establish an iteration complexity at the order of $d^{1/3}\varepsilon^{-2/3}$, which is better than $d^{5/12}\varepsilon^{-1}$, the best known complexity achieved before our work. This convergence analysis is based on a randomized midpoint method, which is first proposed for log-concave sampling (Shen & Lee, 2019), and then extended to diffusion models by Gupta et al. (2024). Our theory accommodates $\varepsilon$-accurate score estimates, and does not require log-concavity on the target distribution. Moreover, the algorithm can also be parallelized to run in only $O(\log^2(d/\varepsilon))$ parallel rounds in a similar way to prior works."
Poster,Improved Diffusion-based Generative Model with Better Adversarial Robustness,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31218,"Zekun Wang, Mingyang Yi, Shuchen Xue, Zhenguo Li, Ming Liu, Bing Qin, Zhi-Ming Ma","Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved significant success in generative tasks. However, their training and sampling processes suffer from the issue of distribution mismatch. During the denoising process, the input data distributions differ between the training and inference stages, potentially leading to inaccurate data generation. To obviate this, we analyze the training objective of DPMs and theoretically demonstrate that this mismatch can be alleviated through Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), which is equivalent to performing robustness-driven Adversarial Training (AT) on DPMs. Furthermore, for the recently proposed Consistency Model (CM), which distills the inference process of the DPM, we prove that its training objective also encounters the mismatch issue. Fortunately, this issue can be mitigated by AT as well. Based on these insights, we propose to conduct efficient AT on both DPM and CM. Finally, extensive empirical studies validate the effectiveness of AT in diffusion-based models. The code is available at https://github.com/kugwzk/AT_Diff."
