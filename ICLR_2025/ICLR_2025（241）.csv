Poster,Offline RL with Smooth OOD Generalization in Convex Hull and its Neighborhood,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28920,"Qingmao Yao, Zhichao Lei, Tianyuan Chen, Ziyue Yuan, Xuefan Chen, Jianxiang Liu, Faguo Wu, Xiao Zhang","Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) struggles with distributional shifts, leading to the $Q$-value overestimation for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Existing methods address this issue by imposing constraints; however, they often become overly conservative when evaluating OOD regions, which constrains the $Q$-function generalization. This over-constraint issue results in poor $Q$-value estimation and hinders policy improvement. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to achieve better $Q$-value estimation by enhancing $Q$-function generalization in OOD regions within Convex Hull and its Neighborhood (CHN). Under the safety generalization guarantees of the CHN, we propose the Smooth Bellman Operator (SBO), which updates OOD $Q$-values by smoothing them with neighboring in-sample $Q$-values. We theoretically show that SBO approximates true $Q$-values for both in-sample and OOD actions within the CHN. Our practical algorithm, Smooth Q-function OOD Generalization (SQOG), empirically alleviates the over-constraint issue, achieving near-accurate $Q$-value estimation. On the D4RL benchmarks, SQOG outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both performance and computational efficiency. Code is available at <https://github.com/yqpqry/SQOG>."
Poster,OGBench: Benchmarking Offline Goal-Conditioned RL,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29950,"Seohong Park, Kevin Frans, Benjamin Eysenbach, Sergey Levine","Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) is a major problem in reinforcement learning (RL) because it provides a simple, unsupervised, and domain-agnostic way to acquire diverse behaviors and representations from unlabeled data without rewards. Despite the importance of this setting, we lack a standard benchmark that can systematically evaluate the capabilities of offline GCRL algorithms. In this work, we propose OGBench, a new, high-quality benchmark for algorithms research in offline goal-conditioned RL. OGBench consists of 8 types of environments, 85 datasets, and reference implementations of 6 representative offline GCRL algorithms. We have designed these challenging and realistic environments and datasets to directly probe different capabilities of algorithms, such as stitching, long-horizon reasoning, and the ability to handle high-dimensional inputs and stochasticity. While representative algorithms may rank similarly on prior benchmarks, our experiments reveal stark strengths and weaknesses in these different capabilities, providing a strong foundation for building new algorithms.

Poster,OLMoE: Open Mixture-of-Experts Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27777,"Niklas Muennighoff, Luca Soldaini, Dirk Groeneveld, Kyle Lo, Jacob Morrison, Sewon Min, Weijia Shi, Pete Walsh, Oyvind Tafjord, Nathan Lambert, Yuling Gu, Shane Arora, Akshita Bhagia, Dustin Schwenk, David Wadden, Alexander Wettig, Binyuan Hui, Tim Dettmers, Douwe Kiela, Ali Farhadi, Noah Smith, Pang Wei Koh, Amanpreet Singh, Hanna Hajishirzi","We introduce OLMoE, a fully open, state-of-the-art language model leveraging sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). OLMoE-1B-7B has 7 billion (B) parameters but uses only 1B per input token. We pretrain it on 5 trillion tokens and further adapt it to create OLMoE-1B-7B-Instruct. Our models outperform all available models with similar active parameters, even surpassing larger ones like Llama2-13B-Chat and DeepSeekMoE-16B. We present novel findings on MoE training, define and analyze new routing properties showing high specialization in our model, and open-source all our work: model weights, training data, code, and logs."
Poster,OMG: Opacity Matters in Material Modeling with Gaussian Splatting,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28342,"Silong Yong, Venkata Nagarjun Pudureddiyur Manivannan, Bernhard Kerbl, Zifu Wan, Simon Stepputtis, Katia Sycara, Yaqi Xie","Decomposing geometry, materials and lighting from a set of images, namely inverse rendering, has been a long-standing problem in computer vision and graphics. Recent advances in neural rendering enable photo-realistic and plausible inverse rendering results. The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has boosted it to the next level by showing real-time rendering potentials.  An intuitive finding is that the models used for inverse rendering do not take into account the dependency of opacity w.r.t. material properties, namely cross section, as suggested by optics. Therefore, we develop a novel approach that adds this dependency to the modeling itself. Inspired by radiative transfer, we augment the opacity term by introducing a neural network that takes as input material properties to provide modeling of cross section and a physically correct activation function. The gradients for material properties are therefore not only from color but also from opacity, facilitating a constraint for their optimization. Therefore, the proposed method incorporates more accurate physical properties compared to previous works. We implement our method into 3 different baselines that use Gaussian Splatting for inverse rendering and achieve significant improvements universally in terms of novel view synthesis and material modeling."
Poster,OmniBind: Large-scale Omni Multimodal Representation via Binding Spaces,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28540,"zehan wang, Ziang Zhang, Minjie Hong, Hang Zhang, Luping Liu, Rongjie Huang, Xize Cheng, Shengpeng Ji, Tao Jin, Hengshuang Zhao, Zhou Zhao","Recently, human-computer interaction with various modalities has shown promising applications, like GPT-4o and Gemini. Meanwhile, multimodal representation models have emerged as the foundation for these versatile multimodal understanding and generation pipeline. Models like CLIP, CLAP and ImageBind can map their specialized modalities into respective joint spaces. To construct a high-quality omni representation space that can be shared and expert in any modality, we propose to merge these advanced models into a unified space in scale. With this insight, we present \textbf{OmniBind}, advanced multimodal joint representation models via fusing knowledge of 14 pre-trained spaces, which support 3D, audio, image, video and language inputs. To alleviate the interference between different knowledge sources in integrated space, we dynamically assign weights to different spaces by learning routers with two objectives: cross-modal overall alignment and language representation decoupling. Notably, since binding and routing spaces only require lightweight networks, OmniBind is extremely training-efficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate the versatility and superiority of OmniBind as an omni representation model, highlighting its great potential for diverse applications, such as any-query and composable multimodal understanding."
Poster,OmniCorpus: A Unified Multimodal Corpus of 10 Billion-Level Images Interleaved with Text,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/32063,"Qingyun Li, Zhe Chen, Weiyun Wang, Wenhai Wang, Shenglong Ye, Zhenjiang Jin, Guanzhou Chen, Yinan He, Zhangwei Gao, Erfei Cui, Jiashuo Yu, Hao Tian, Jiasheng Zhou, Chao Xu, Bin Wang, Xingjian Wei, Wei Li, Wenjian Zhang, Bo Zhang, Pinlong Cai, Licheng Wen, Xiangchao Yan, Pei Chu, Yi Wang, Min Dou, Changyao Tian, Xizhou Zhu, Lewei Lu, Yushi Chen, Junjun He, Tong Lu, Yali Wang, Limin Wang, Dahua Lin, Yu Qiao, Botian Shi, Conghui He, Jifeng Dai","Image-text interleaved data, consisting of multiple images and texts arranged in a natural document format, aligns with the presentation paradigm of internet data and closely resembles human reading habits. Recent studies have shown that such data aids multimodal in-context learning and maintains the capabilities of large language models during multimodal fine-tuning. However, the limited scale and diversity of current image-text interleaved data restrict the development of multimodal large language models. In this paper, we introduce OmniCorpus, a 10 billion-scale image-text interleaved dataset. Using an efficient data engine, we filter and extract large-scale high-quality documents, which contain 8.6 billion images and 1,696 billion text tokens. Compared to counterparts (e.g., MMC4, OBELICS), our dataset 1) has 15 times larger scales while maintaining good data quality; 2) features more diverse sources, including both English and non-English websites as well as video-centric websites; 3) is more flexible, easily degradable from an image-text interleaved format to pure text corpus and image-text pairs. Through comprehensive analysis and experiments, we validate the quality, usability, and effectiveness of the proposed dataset. We hope this could provide a solid data foundation for future multimodal model research."
Poster,OmniEdit: Building Image Editing Generalist Models Through Specialist Supervision,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30213,"Cong Wei, Zheyang Xiong, Weiming Ren, Xeron Du, Ge Zhang, Wenhu Chen","Instruction-guided image editing methods have demonstrated significant potential by training diffusion models on automatically synthesized or manually annotated image editing pairs. However, these methods remain far from practical, real-life applications. We identify three primary challenges contributing to this gap. Firstly, existing models have limited editing skills due to the biased synthesis process. Secondly, these methods are trained with datasets with a high volume of noise and artifacts. This is due to the application of simple filtering methods like CLIP-score. Thirdly, all these datasets are restricted to a single low resolution and fixed aspect ratio, limiting the versatility to handle real-world use cases.In this paper, we present OmniEdit, which is an omnipotent editor to handle seven different image editing tasks with any aspect ratio seamlessly. Our contribution is in four folds: (1) OmniEdit is trained by utilizing the supervision from seven different specialist models to ensure task coverage. (2) we utilize importance sampling based on the scores provided by large multimodal models (like GPT-4o) instead of CLIP-score to improve the data quality. (3) we propose a new editing architecture called EditNet to greatly boost the editing success rate, (4) we provide images with different aspect ratios to ensure that our model can handle any image in the wild. We have curated a test set containing images of different aspect ratios, accompanied by diverse instructions to cover different tasks. Both automatic evaluation and human evaluations demonstrate that OmniEdit can significantly outperforms all the existing models."
Poster,OMNI-EPIC: Open-endedness via Models of human Notions of Interestingness with Environments Programmed in Code,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29279,"Maxence Faldor, Jenny Zhang, Antoine Cully, Jeff Clune","Open-ended and AI-generating algorithms aim to continuously generate and solve increasingly complex tasks indefinitely, offering a promising path toward more general intelligence. To accomplish this grand vision, learning must occur within a vast array of potential tasks. Existing approaches to automatically generating environments are constrained within manually predefined, often narrow distributions of environments, limiting their ability to create any learning environment. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework, OMNI-EPIC, that augments previous work in Open-endedness via Models of human Notions of Interestingness (OMNI) with Environments Programmed in Code (EPIC). OMNI-EPIC leverages foundation models to autonomously generate code specifying the next learnable (i.e., not too easy or difficult for the agent’s current skill set) and interesting (e.g., worthwhile and novel) tasks. OMNI-EPIC generates both environments (e.g., an obstacle course) and reward functions (e.g., progress through the obstacle course quickly without touching red objects), enabling it, in principle, to create any simulatable learning task. We showcase the explosive creativity of OMNI-EPIC, which continuously innovates to suggest new, interesting learning challenges. We also highlight how OMNI-EPIC can adapt to reinforcement learning agents’ learning progress, generating tasks that are of suitable difficulty. Overall, OMNI-EPIC has the potential to endlessly create learnable and interesting environments, further propelling the development of self-improving AI systems and AI-Generating Algorithms."
Poster,OmniKV: Dynamic Context Selection for Efficient Long-Context LLMs,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27961,"Jitai Hao, Yuke Zhu, Tian Wang, Jun Yu, Xin Xin, Bo Zheng, Zhaochun Ren, Sheng Guo","During the inference phase of Large Language Models (LLMs) with long context, a substantial portion of GPU memory is allocated to the KV cache, with memory usage increasing as the sequence length grows. To mitigate the GPU memory footprint associate with KV cache, some previous studies have discarded less important tokens based on the sparsity identified in attention scores in long context scenarios. However, we argue that attention scores cannot indicate the future importance of tokens in subsequent generation iterations, because attention scores are calculated based on current hidden states. Therefore, we propose OmniKV, a token-dropping-free and training-free inference method, which achieves a 1.68x speedup without any loss in performance. It is well-suited for offloading, significantly reducing KV cache memory usage by up to 75% with it. The core innovative insight of OmniKV is: Within a single generation iteration, there is a high degree of similarity in the important tokens identified across consecutive layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniKV achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, with particularly advantages in chain-of-thoughts scenarios. OmniKV extends the maximum context length supported by a single A100 for Llama-3-8B from 128K to 450K. Our code is available at https://github.com/antgroup/OmniKV.git."
Poster,Omni-MATH: A Universal Olympiad Level Mathematic Benchmark for Large Language Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27714,"Bofei Gao, Feifan Song, Zhe Yang, Zefan Cai, Yibo Miao, Qingxiu Dong, Lei Li, Chenghao Ma, Liang Chen, runxin xu, Zhengyang Tang, Wang Benyou, Daoguang Zan, Shanghaoran Quan, Ge Zhang, Lei Sha, Yichang Zhang, Xuancheng Ren, Tianyu Liu, Baobao Chang","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to significant breakthroughs in mathematical reasoning capabilities. However, existing benchmarks like GSM8K or MATH are now being solved with high accuracy (e.g., OpenAI o1 achieves 94.8% on MATH dataset), indicating their inadequacy for truly challenging these models. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive and challenging benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' mathematical reasoning at the Olympiad level. Unlike existing Olympiad-related benchmarks, our dataset focuses exclusively on mathematics and comprises a vast collection of 4428 competition-level problems with rigorous human annotation. These problems are meticulously categorized into over 33 sub-domains and span more than 10 distinct difficulty levels, enabling a holistic assessment of model performance in Olympiad-mathematical reasoning. Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis based on this benchmark. Our experimental results show that even the most advanced models, OpenAI o1-mini and OpenAI o1-preview, struggle with highly challenging Olympiad-level problems, with 60.54% and 52.55% accuracy, highlighting significant challenges in Olympiad-level mathematical reasoning."
