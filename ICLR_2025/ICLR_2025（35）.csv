Poster,BEEM: Boosting Performance of Early Exit DNNs using Multi-Exit Classifiers as Experts,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30371,"Divya Jyoti Bajpai, Manjesh Kumar Hanawal","Early Exit (EE) techniques have emerged as a means to reduce inference latency in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The latency improvement and accuracy in these techniques crucially depend on the criteria used to make exit decisions. We propose a new decision criterion BEEM where exit classifiers are treated as experts and aggregate their confidence scores. The confidence scores are aggregated only if neighbouring experts are consistent in prediction as the samples pass through them, thus capturing their ensemble effect. A sample exits when the aggregated confidence value exceeds a threshold. The threshold is set using the error rates of the intermediate exits aiming to surpass the performance of conventional DNN inference. Experimental results on the COCO dataset for Image captioning and GLUE datasets for various language tasks demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of state-of-the-art EE methods, achieving improvements in speed-up by a factor $1.5\times$ to $2.1\times$. When compared to the final layer, its accuracy is comparable in harder Image Captioning and improves in the easier language tasks.

Poster,Behavioral Entropy-Guided Dataset Generation for Offline Reinforcement Learning,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29971,"Wesley Suttle, Aamodh Suresh, Carlos Nieto-Granda","Entropy-based objectives are widely used to perform state space exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) and dataset generation for offline RL. Behavioral entropy (BE), a rigorous generalization of classical entropies that incorporates cognitive and perceptual biases of agents, was recently proposed for discrete settings and shown to be a promising metric for robotic exploration problems. In this work, we propose using BE as a principled exploration objective for systematically generating datasets that provide diverse state space coverage in complex, continuous, potentially high-dimensional domains. To achieve this, we extend the notion of BE to continuous settings, derive tractable $k$-nearest neighbor estimators, provide theoretical guarantees for these estimators, and develop practical reward functions that can be used with standard RL methods to learn BE-maximizing policies. Using standard MuJoCo environments, we experimentally compare the performance of offline RL algorithms for a variety of downstream tasks on datasets generated using BE, R\'{e}nyi, and Shannon entropy-maximizing policies, as well as the SMM and RND algorithms. We find that offline RL algorithms trained on datasets collected using BE outperform those trained on datasets collected using Shannon entropy, SMM, and RND on all tasks considered, and on 80\% of the tasks compared to datasets collected using Renyi entropy."
Poster,Be More Diverse than the Most Diverse: Optimal Mixtures of Generative Models via Mixture-UCB Bandit Algorithms,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31154,"Parham Rezaei, Farzan Farnia, Cheuk Ting Li","The availability of multiple training algorithms and architectures for generative models requires a selection mechanism to form a single model over a group of well-trained generation models. The selection task is commonly addressed by identifying the model that maximizes an evaluation score based on the diversity and quality of the generated data. However, such a best-model identification approach overlooks the possibility that a mixture of available models can outperform each individual model. In this work, we numerically show that a mixture of generative models on benchmark image datasets can indeed achieve a better evaluation score (based on FID and KID scores), compared to the individual models. This observation motivates the development of efficient algorithms for selecting the optimal mixture of the models. To address this, we formulate a quadratic optimization problem to find an optimal mixture model achieving the maximum of kernel-based evaluation scores including kernel inception distance (KID) and Rényi kernel entropy (RKE). To identify the optimal mixture of the models using the fewest possible sample queries, we view the selection task as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem and propose the *Mixture Upper Confidence Bound (Mixture-UCB)* algorithm that provably converges to the optimal mixture of the involved models. More broadly, the proposed Mixture-UCB can be extended to optimize every convex quadratic function of the mixture weights in a general MAB setting. We prove a regret bound for the  Mixture-UCB algorithm and perform several numerical experiments to show the success of Mixture-UCB in finding the optimal mixture of text and image generative models. The project code is available in the [Mixture-UCB Github repository](https://github.com/Rezaei-Parham/Mixture-UCB)."
Poster,Benchmarking Agentic Workflow Generation,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27882,"Shuofei Qiao, Runnan Fang, Zhisong Qiu, Xiaobin Wang, Ningyu Zhang, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Huajun Chen","Large Language Models (LLMs), with their exceptional ability to handle a wide range of tasks, have driven significant advancements in tackling reasoning and planning tasks, wherein decomposing complex problems into executable workflows is a crucial step in this process. Existing workflow evaluation frameworks either focus solely on holistic performance or suffer from limitations such as restricted scenario coverage, simplistic workflow structures, and lax evaluation standards. To this end, we introduce WorfBench, a unified workflow generation benchmark with multi-faceted scenarios and intricate graph workflow structures. Additionally, we present WorfEval, a systemic evaluation protocol utilizing subsequence and subgraph matching algorithms to accurately quantify the LLM agent's workflow generation capabilities. Through comprehensive evaluations across different types of LLMs, we discover distinct gaps between the sequence planning capabilities and graph planning capabilities of LLM agents, with even GPT-4 exhibiting a gap of around 15%. We also train two open-source models and evaluate their generalization abilities on held-out tasks. Furthermore, we observe that the generated workflows can enhance downstream tasks, enabling them to achieve superior performance with less time during inference. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/WorfBench."
Poster,Benchmarking LLMs' Judgments with No Gold Standard,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/27990,"Shengwei Xu, Yuxuan Lu, Grant Schoenebeck, Yuqing Kong","We introduce the GEM (Generative Estimator for Mutual Information), an evaluation metric for assessing language generation by large language models (LLMs), particularly in generating informative judgments, without the need for a gold standard reference. GEM broadens the scenarios where we can benchmark LLM generation performance-from traditional ones, like machine translation and summarization, where gold standard references are readily available, to subjective tasks without clear gold standards, such as academic peer review.GEM uses a generative model to estimate mutual information between candidate and reference responses, without requiring the reference to be a gold standard. In experiments on two human-annotated datasets, GEM demonstrates competitive correlations with human scores compared to the state-of-the-art GPT-4o Examiner, and outperforms all other baselines. Additionally, GEM is more robust against strategic manipulation, such as rephrasing or elongation, which can artificially inflate scores under a GPT-4o Examiner. We also present GRE-bench (Generating Review Evaluation Benchmark) which evaluates LLMs based on how well they can generate high-quality peer reviews for academic research papers.  Because GRE-bench is based upon GEM, it inherits its robustness properties.  Additionally, GRE-bench circumvents data contamination problems (or data leakage) by using the continuous influx of new open-access research papers and peer reviews each year. We show GRE-bench results of various popular LLMs on their peer review capabilities using the ICLR2023 dataset."
Poster,Benchmarking Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation with Dynamic VQA Dataset and Self-adaptive Planning Agent,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/29392,"Yangning Li, Yinghui Li, Xinyu Wang, Yong Jiang, Zhen Zhang, Xinran Zheng, HUI WANG, Hai-Tao Zheng, Fei Huang, Jingren Zhou, Philip Yu","Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (mRAG) plays an important role in mitigating the “hallucination” issue inherent in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Although promising, existing heuristic mRAGs typically predefined fixed retrieval processes, which causes two issues: (1) Non-adaptive Retrieval Queries. (2) Overloaded Retrieval Queries. However, these flaws cannot be adequately reflected by current knowledge-seeking visual question answering (VQA) datasets, since the most required knowledge can be readily obtained with a standard two-step retrieval. To bridge the dataset gap, we first construct Dyn-VQA dataset, consisting of three types of ``dynamic'' questions, which require complex knowledge retrieval strategies variable in query, tool, and time: (1) Questions with rapidly changing answers. (2) Questions requiring multi-modal knowledge. (3) Multi-hop questions. Experiments on Dyn-VQA reveal that existing heuristic mRAGs struggle to provide sufficient and precisely relevant knowledge for dynamic questions due to their rigid retrieval processes. Hence, we further propose the first self-adaptive planning agent for multimodal retrieval, **OmniSearch**. The underlying idea is to emulate the human behavior in question solution which dynamically decomposes complex multimodal questions into sub-question chains with retrieval action. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of our OmniSearch, also provide direction for advancing mRAG. Code and dataset will be open-sourced."
Poster,Benchmarking Predictive Coding Networks -- Made Simple,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28118,"Luca Pinchetti, Chang Qi, Oleh Lokshyn, Cornelius Emde, Amine M&#x27;Charrak, Mufeng Tang, Simon Frieder, Bayar Menzat, Gaspard Oliviers, Rafal Bogacz, Thomas Lukasiewicz, Tommaso Salvatori","In this work, we tackle the problems of efficiency and scalability for predictive coding networks (PCNs) in machine learning. To do so, we  propose a library that focuses on performance and simplicity, and use it to implement a large set of standard benchmarks for the community to use for their experiments. As most works in the field propose their own tasks and architectures, do not compare one against each other, and focus on small-scale tasks, a simple and fast open-source library, and a comprehensive set of benchmarks, would address all of these concerns. Then, we perform extensive tests on such benchmarks using both existing algorithms for PCNs, as well as adaptations of other methods popular in the bio-plausible deep learning community. All of this has allowed us to (i) test architectures much larger than commonly used in the literature, on more complex datasets; (ii) reach new state-of-the-art results in all of the tasks and dataset provided; (iii) clearly highlight what the current limitations of PCNs are, allowing us to state important future research directions. With the hope of galvanizing community efforts towards one of the main open problems in the field, scalability, we will release the code, tests, and benchmarks."
Poster,Benchmarking Vision Language Model Unlearning via Fictitious Facial Identity Dataset,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/31229,"Yingzi Ma, Jiongxiao Wang, Fei Wang, Siyuan Ma, Jiazhao Li, Jinsheng Pan, Xiujun Li, Furong Huang, Lichao Sun, Bo Li, Yejin Choi, Muhao Chen, Chaowei Xiao","Machine unlearning has emerged as an effective strategy for forgetting specific information in the training data. However, with the increasing integration of visual data, privacy concerns in Vision Language Models (VLMs) remain underexplored. To address this, we introduce Facial Identity Unlearning Benchmark (FIUBench), a novel VLM unlearning benchmark designed to robustly evaluate the effectiveness of unlearning algorithms under the Right to be Forgotten setting. Specifically, we formulate the VLM unlearning task via constructing the Fictitious Facial Identity VQA dataset and apply a two-stage evaluation pipeline that is designed to precisely control the sources of information and their exposure levels. In terms of evaluation, since VLM supports various forms of ways to ask questions with the same semantic meaning,  we also provide robust evaluation metrics including membership inference attacks and carefully designed adversarial privacy attacks to evaluate the performance of algorithms.  Through the evaluation of four baseline VLM unlearning algorithms within FIUBench, we find that all methods remain limited in their unlearning performance, with significant trade-offs between model utility and forget quality. Furthermore, our findings also highlight the importance of privacy attacks for robust evaluations. We hope FIUBench will drive progress in developing more effective VLM unlearning algorithms."
Poster,Benign Overfitting in Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Linear Models,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/30869,"Shange Tang, Jiayun Wu, Jianqing Fan, Chi Jin","Benign overfitting refers to the phenomenon where an over-parameterized model fits the training data perfectly, including noise in the data, but still generalizes well to the unseen test data. While prior work provides some theoretical understanding of this phenomenon under the in-distribution setup, modern machine learning often operates in a more challenging Out-of-Distribution (OOD) regime, where the target (test) distribution can be rather different from the source (training) distribution. In this work, we take an initial step towards understanding benign overfitting in the OOD regime by focusing on the basic setup of over-parameterized linear models under covariate shift. We provide non-asymptotic guarantees proving that benign overfitting occurs in standard ridge regression, even under the OOD regime when the target covariance satisfies certain structural conditions. We identify several vital quantities relating to source and target covariance, which govern the performance of OOD generalization. Our result is sharp, which provably recovers prior in-distribution benign overfitting guarantee (Tsigler & Bartlett, 2023), as well as under-parameterized OOD guarantee (Ge et al., 2024) when specializing to each setup. Moreover, we also present theoretical results for a more general family of target covariance matrix, where standard ridge regression only achieves a slow statistical rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{n})$ for the excess risk, while Principal Component Regression (PCR) is guaranteed to achieve the fast rate $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$, where $n$ is the number of samples."
Poster,BenTo: Benchmark Reduction with In-Context Transferability,https://iclr.cc//virtual/2025/poster/28565,"Hongyu Zhao, Ming Li, Lichao Sun, Tianyi Zhou","Evaluating large language models (LLMs) is costly: it requires the generation and examination of LLM outputs on a large-scale benchmark of various tasks. This paper investigates how to efficiently reduce the tasks used to benchmark LLMs without affecting the evaluation quality. Our study reveals that task transferability and relevance provide critical information to identify the most representative subset of tasks via optimizing a facility location function. We propose a practically efficient metric for estimating the transferability between two tasks via in-context learning (ICL). By analyzing the pairwise transferability, we can reduce tasks in a modern LLM benchmark (e.g., MMLU or FLAN) to 5\% while inducing only a $<4$\% difference to the evaluation on the original benchmark. Compared to prior works, our method is training-free, gradient-free, and highly efficient requiring ICL only."
