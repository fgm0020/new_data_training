Poster,Cross-Modality Perturbation Synergy Attack for Person Re-identification,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95597,"Yunpeng Gong, Zhun Zhong, Yansong Qu, Zhiming Luo, Rongrong Ji, Min JIANG","In recent years, there has been significant research focusing on addressing security concerns in single-modal person re-identification (ReID) systems that are based on RGB images. However, the safety of cross-modality scenarios, which are more commonly encountered in practical applications involving images captured by infrared cameras, has not received adequate attention. The main challenge in cross-modality ReID lies in effectively dealing with visual differences between different modalities. For instance, infrared images are typically grayscale, unlike visible images that contain color information. Existing attack methods have primarily focused on the characteristics of the visible image modality, overlooking the features of other modalities and the variations in data distribution among different modalities. This oversight can potentially undermine the effectiveness of these methods in image retrieval across diverse modalities. This study represents the first exploration into the security of cross-modality ReID models and proposes a universal perturbation attack specifically designed for cross-modality ReID. This attack optimizes perturbations by leveraging gradients from diverse modality data, thereby disrupting the discriminator and reinforcing the differences between modalities. We conducted experiments on three widely used cross-modality datasets, namely RegDB, SYSU, and LLCM. The results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of our method but also provide insights for future improvements in the robustness of cross-modality ReID systems."
Poster,Cross-modal Representation Flattening for Multi-modal Domain Generalization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94949,"Yunfeng FAN, Wenchao Xu, Haozhao Wang, Song Guo","Multi-modal domain generalization (MMDG) requires that models trained on multi-modal source domains can generalize to unseen target distributions with the same modality set. Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) is an effective technique for traditional uni-modal domain generalization (DG), however, with limited improvement in MMDG. In this paper, we identify that modality competition and discrepant uni-modal flatness are two main factors that restrict multi-modal generalization. To overcome these challenges, we propose to construct consistent flat loss regions and enhance knowledge exploitation for each modality via cross-modal knowledge transfer. Firstly, we turn to the optimization on representation-space loss landscapes instead of traditional parameter space, which allows us to build connections between modalities directly. Then, we introduce a novel method to flatten the high-loss region between minima from different modalities by interpolating mixed multi-modal representations. We implement this method by distilling and optimizing generalizable interpolated representations and assigning distinct weights for each modality considering their divergent generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments are performed on two benchmark datasets, EPIC-Kitchens and Human-Animal-Cartoon (HAC), with various modality combinations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method under multi-source and single-source settings. Our code is open-sourced."
Poster,Cross-model Control: Improving Multiple Large Language Models in One-time Training,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94699,"Jiayi Wu, Hao Sun, Hengyi Cai, Lixin Su, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Xiang Li, Ming Gao","The number of large language models (LLMs) with varying parameter scales and vocabularies is increasing. While they deliver powerful performance, they also face a set of common optimization needs to meet specific requirements or standards, such as instruction following or avoiding the output of sensitive information from the real world. However, how to reuse the fine-tuning outcomes of one model to other models to reduce training costs remains a challenge. To bridge this gap, we introduce Cross-model Control (CMC), a method that improves multiple LLMs in one-time training with a portable tiny language model. Specifically, we have observed that the logit shift before and after fine-tuning is remarkably similar across different models. Based on this insight, we incorporate a tiny language model with a minimal number of parameters. By training alongside a frozen template LLM, the tiny model gains the capability to alter the logits output by the LLMs. To make this tiny language model applicable to models with different vocabularies, we propose a novel token mapping strategy named PM-MinED. We have conducted extensive experiments on instruction tuning and unlearning tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of CMC. Our code is available at https://github.com/wujwyi/CMC"
Poster,Cross-Scale Self-Supervised Blind Image Deblurring via Implicit Neural Representation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96154,"Tianjing Zhang, Yuhui Quan, Hui Ji","Blind image deblurring (BID) is an important yet challenging image recovery problem. Most existing deep learning methods require supervised training with ground truth (GT) images. This paper introduces a self-supervised method for BID that does not require GT images. The key challenge is to regularize the training to prevent over-fitting due to the absence of GT images. By leveraging an exact relationship among the blurred image, latent image, and blur kernel across consecutive scales, we propose an effective cross-scale consistency loss. This is implemented by representing the image and kernel with implicit neural representations (INRs), whose resolution-free property enables consistent yet efficient computation for network training across multiple scales. Combined with a progressively coarse-to-fine training scheme, the proposed method significantly outperforms existing self-supervised methods  in extensive experiments."
Poster,Cross-video Identity Correlating for Person Re-identification Pre-training,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95254,"Jialong Zuo, Ying Nie, Hanyu Zhou, Huaxin Zhang, Haoyu Wang, Tianyu Guo, Nong Sang, Changxin Gao","Recent researches have proven that pre-training on large-scale person images extracted from internet videos is an effective way in learning better representations for person re-identification. However, these researches are mostly confined to pre-training at the instance-level or single-video tracklet-level. They ignore the identity-invariance in images of the same person across different videos, which is a key focus in person re-identification. To address this issue, we propose a Cross-video Identity-cOrrelating pre-traiNing (CION) framework. Defining a noise concept that comprehensively considers both intra-identity consistency and inter-identity discrimination, CION seeks the identity correlation from cross-video images by modeling it as a progressive multi-level denoising problem. Furthermore, an identity-guided self-distillation loss is proposed to implement better large-scale pre-training by mining the identity-invariance within person images. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the superiority of our CION in terms of efficiency and performance. CION achieves significantly leading performance with even fewer training samples. For example, compared with the previous state-of-the-art ISR, CION with the same ResNet50-IBN achieves higher mAP of 93.3% and 74.3% on Market1501 and MSMT17, while only utilizing 8% training samples. Finally, with CION demonstrating superior model-agnostic ability, we contribute a model zoo named ReIDZoo to meet diverse research and application needs in this field. It contains a series of CION pre-trained models with spanning structures and parameters, totaling 32 models with 10 different structures, including GhostNet, ConvNext, RepViT, FastViT and so on. The code and models will be open-sourced."
Poster,"CRT-Fusion: Camera, Radar, Temporal Fusion Using  Motion Information  for 3D Object Detection",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96022,"Jisong Kim, Minjae Seong, Jun Won Choi","Accurate and robust 3D object detection is a critical component in autonomous vehicles and robotics. While recent radar-camera fusion methods have made significant progress by fusing information in the bird's-eye view (BEV) representation, they often struggle to effectively capture the motion of dynamic objects, leading to limited performance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CRT-Fusion, a novel framework that integrates temporal information into radar-camera fusion to address this challenge. Our approach comprises three key modules: Multi-View Fusion (MVF), Motion Feature Estimator (MFE), and Motion Guided Temporal Fusion (MGTF). The MVF module fuses radar and image features within both the camera view and bird's-eye view, thereby generating a more precise unified BEV representation. The MFE module conducts two simultaneous tasks: estimation of pixel-wise velocity information and BEV segmentation. Based on the velocity and the occupancy score map obtained from the MFE module, the MGTF module aligns and fuses feature maps across multiple timestamps in a recurrent manner. By considering the motion of dynamic objects, CRT-Fusion can produce robust BEV feature maps, thereby improving detection accuracy and robustness. Extensive evaluations on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that CRT-Fusion achieves state-of-the-art performance for radar-camera-based 3D object detection. Our approach outperforms the previous best method in terms of NDS by +1.7%, while also surpassing the leading approach in mAP by +1.4%. These significant improvements in both metrics showcase the effectiveness of our proposed fusion strategy in enhancing the reliability and accuracy of 3D object detection."
Poster,CryoBench: Diverse and challenging datasets for the heterogeneity problem in cryo-EM,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97535,"Minkyu Jeon, Rishwanth Raghu, Miro Astore, Geoffrey Woollard, J. Feathers, Alkin Kaz, Sonya Hanson, Pilar Cossio, Ellen Zhong","Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)  is a powerful technique for determining high-resolution 3D biomolecular structures from imaging data. Its unique ability to capture structural variability has spurred the development of heterogeneous reconstruction algorithms that can infer distributions of 3D structures from noisy, unlabeled imaging data. Despite the growing number of advanced methods, progress in the field is hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks with ground truth information and reliable validation metrics. Here, we introduce CryoBench, a suite of datasets, metrics, and benchmarks for heterogeneous reconstruction in cryo-EM. CryoBench includes five datasets representing different sources of heterogeneity and degrees of difficulty. These include conformational heterogeneity generated from designed motions of antibody complexes or sampled from a molecular dynamics simulation, as well as {compositional heterogeneity from mixtures of ribosome assembly states or 100 common complexes present in cells. We then analyze state-of-the-art heterogeneous reconstruction tools, including neural and non-neural methods, assess their sensitivity to noise, and propose new metrics for quantitative evaluation. We hope that CryoBench will be a foundational resource for accelerating algorithmic development and evaluation in the cryo-EM and machine learning communities.

Poster,CryoGEM: Physics-Informed Generative Cryo-Electron Microscopy,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94256,"Jiakai Zhang, Qihe Chen, Yan Zeng, Wenyuan Gao, Xuming He, Zhijie Liu, Jingyi Yu","In the past decade, deep conditional generative models have revolutionized the generation of realistic images, extending their application from entertainment to scientific domains. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is crucial in resolving near-atomic resolution 3D structures of proteins, such as the SARS-COV-2 spike protein. To achieve high-resolution reconstruction, a comprehensive data processing pipeline has been adopted. However, its performance is still limited as it lacks high-quality annotated datasets for training. To address this, we introduce physics-informed generative cryo-electron microscopy (CryoGEM), which for the first time integrates physics-based cryo-EM simulation with a generative unpaired noise translation to generate physically correct synthetic cryo-EM datasets with realistic noises. Initially, CryoGEM simulates the cryo-EM imaging process based on a virtual specimen. To generate realistic noises, we leverage an unpaired noise translation via contrastive learning with a novel mask-guided sampling scheme. Extensive experiments show that CryoGEM is capable of generating authentic cryo-EM images. The generated dataset can be used as training data for particle picking and pose estimation models, eventually improving the reconstruction resolution."
Poster,CryoSPIN: Improving Ab-Initio Cryo-EM Reconstruction with Semi-Amortized Pose Inference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96869,"Shayan Shekarforoush, David Lindell, Marcus Brubaker, David Fleet","Cryo-EM is an increasingly popular method for determining the atomic resolution 3D structure of macromolecular complexes (eg, proteins) from noisy 2D images captured by an electron microscope. The computational task is to reconstruct the 3D density of the particle, along with 3D pose of the particle in each 2D image, for which the posterior pose distribution is highly multi-modal. Recent developments in cryo-EM have focused on deep learning for which amortized inference has been used to predict pose. Here, we address key problems with this approach, and propose a new semi-amortized method, cryoSPIN, in which reconstruction begins with amortized inference and then switches to a form of auto-decoding to refine poses locally using stochastic gradient descent. Through evaluation on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that cryoSPIN is able to handle multi-modal pose distributions during the amortized inference stage, while the later, more flexible stage of direct pose optimization yields faster and more accurate convergence of poses compared to baselines. On experimental data, we show that cryoSPIN outperforms the state-of-the-art cryoAI in speed and reconstruction quality."
Poster,Cryptographic Hardness of Score Estimation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94969,Min Jae Song,"We show that L2-accurate score estimation, in the absence of strong assumptions on the data distribution, is computationally hard even when sample complexity is polynomial in the relevant problem parameters. Our reduction builds on the result of Chen et al. (ICLR 2023), who showed that the problem of generating samples from an unknown data distribution reduces to L2-accurate score estimation. Our hard-to-estimate distributions are the ""Gaussian pancakes"" distributions, originally due to Diakonikolas et al. (FOCS 2017), which have been shown to be computationally indistinguishable from the standard Gaussian under widely believed hardness assumptions from lattice-based cryptography (Bruna et al., STOC 2021; Gupte et al., FOCS 2022)."
