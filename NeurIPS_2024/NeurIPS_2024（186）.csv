Poster,HOPE: Shape Matching Via Aligning Different K-hop Neighbourhoods,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96838,"Barakeel Fanseu Kamhoua, Huamin Qu","Accurate and smooth shape matching is very hard to achieve. This is because for accuracy, one needs unique descriptors (signatures) on shapes that distinguish different vertices on a mesh accurately while at the same time being invariant to deformations. However, most existing unique shape descriptors are generally not smooth on the shape and are not noise-robust thus leading to non-smooth matches. On the other hand, for smoothness, one needs descriptors that are smooth and continuous on the shape. However, existing smooth descriptors are generally not unique and as such lose accuracy as they match neighborhoods (for smoothness) rather than exact vertices (for accuracy). In this work, we propose to use different k-hop neighborhoods of vertices as pairwise descriptors for shape matching. We use these descriptors in conjunction with local map distortion (LMD) to refine an initialized map for shape matching. We validate the effectiveness of our pipeline on benchmark datasets such as SCAPE, TOSCA, TOPKIDS, and others."
Poster,HORSE: Hierarchical Representation for Large-Scale Neural Subset Selection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96091,"Binghui Xie, Yixuan Wang, Yongqiang Chen, Kaiwen Zhou, Yu Li, Wei Meng, James Cheng","Subset selection tasks, such as anomaly detection and compound selection in AI-assisted drug discovery, are crucial for a wide range of applications. Learning subset-valued functions with neural networks has achieved great success by incorporating permutation invariance symmetry into the architecture. However, existing neural set architectures often struggle to either capture comprehensive information from the superset or address complex interactions within the input. Additionally, they often fail to perform in scenarios where superset sizes surpass available memory capacity. To address these challenges, we introduce the novel concept of the Identity Property, which requires models to integrate information from the originating set, resulting in the development of neural networks that excel at performing effective subset selection from large supersets. Moreover, we present the Hierarchical Representation of Neural Subset Selection (HORSE), an attention-based method that learns complex interactions and retains information from both the input set and the optimal subset supervision signal. Specifically, HORSE enables the partitioning of the input ground set into manageable chunks that can be processed independently and then aggregated, ensuring consistent outcomes across different partitions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that HORSE significantly enhances neural subset selection performance by capturing more complex information and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in handling large-scale inputs by a margin of up to 20%."
Poster,HourVideo: 1-Hour Video-Language Understanding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97793,"Keshigeyan Chandrasegaran, Agrim Gupta, Lea M. Hadzic, Taran Kota, Jimming He, Cristobal Eyzaguirre, Zane Durante, Manling Li, Jiajun Wu, Fei-Fei Li","We present **HourVideo**, a benchmark dataset for hour-long video-language understanding. Our dataset consists of a novel task suite comprising summarization, perception (*recall*, *tracking*), visual reasoning (*spatial*, *temporal*, *predictive*, *causal*, *counterfactual*), and navigation (*room-to-room*, *object retrieval*) tasks. HourVideo includes 500 manually curated egocentric videos from the Ego4D dataset, spanning durations of 20 to 120 minutes, and features **12,976 high-quality, five-way multiple-choice questions**. Benchmarking results reveal that multimodal models, including GPT-4 and LLaVA-NeXT, achieve marginal improvements over random chance. In stark contrast, human experts significantly outperform the state-of-the-art long-context multimodal model, Gemini Pro 1.5 (85.0\% vs. 37.3\%), highlighting a substantial gap in multimodal capabilities. Our benchmark, evaluation toolkit, prompts, and documentation are available at https://hourvideo.stanford.edu."
Poster,How Control Information Influences Multilingual Text Image Generation and Editing?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93460,"Boqiang Zhang, Zuan Gao, Yadong Qu, Hongtao Xie","Visual text generation has significantly advanced through diffusion models aimed at producing images with readable and realistic text. Recent works primarily use a ControlNet-based framework, employing standard font text images to control diffusion models. Recognizing the critical role of control information in generating high-quality text, we investigate its influence from three perspectives: input encoding, role at different stages, and output features. Our findings reveal that: 1) Input control information has unique characteristics compared to conventional inputs like Canny edges and depth maps. 2) Control information plays distinct roles at different stages of the denoising process. 3) Output control features significantly differ from the base and skip features of the U-Net decoder in the frequency domain. Based on these insights, we propose TextGen, a novel framework designed to enhance generation quality by optimizing control information. We improve input and output features using Fourier analysis to emphasize relevant information and reduce noise. Additionally, we employ a two-stage generation framework to align the different roles of control information at different stages. Furthermore, we introduce an effective and lightweight dataset for training. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Chinese and English text generation. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/CyrilSterling/TextGen."
Poster,How Diffusion Models Learn to Factorize and Compose,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95399,"Qiyao Liang, Ziming Liu, Mitchell Ostrow, Ila Fiete","Diffusion models are capable of generating photo-realistic images that combine elements which do not appear together in natural images, demonstrating their ability to compositionally generalize. Nonetheless, the precise mechanism of compositionality and how it is acquired through training remains elusive. Here, we consider a highly reduced setting to examine whether diffusion models learn semantically meaningful and fully factorized representations of composable features. We performed extensive controlled experiments on conditional DDPMs trained to generate various forms of 2D Gaussian data. We demonstrate that the models learn factorized, semi-continuous manifold representations that are orthogonal in underlying continuous latent features of independent variations but are not aligned for different values of the same feature. With such representations, models demonstrate superior compositionality but have limited ability to interpolate over unseen values of a given feature. Our experimental results further demonstrate that diffusion models can attain compositionality with a small amount of compositional examples, suggesting a novel way to train DDPMs. Finally, we connect manifold formation in diffusion models to percolation theory in physics, thereby offering insights into the sudden onset of factorized representation learning. Our thorough toy experiments thus contribute a deeper understanding of how diffusion models capture compositional structure in data, paving the way for future research aimed at enhancing factorization and compositional generalization in generative models for real-world applications."
Poster,How does Architecture Influence the Base Capabilities of Pre-trained Language Models? A Case Study Based on FFN-Wider and MoE Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96546,"Xin Lu, Yanyan Zhao, Bing Qin, Liangyu Huo, Qing Yang, Dongliang Xu","Pre-trained language models have been proven to possess strong base capabilities, which not only excel in in-distribution language modeling but also show powerful abilities in out-of-distribution language modeling, transfer learning and few-shot learning. Unlike existing work focusing on the influence of scale on base capabilities, our work examines the influence of architecture on those. Specifically, our concern is: How does architecture influence the base capabilities of pre-trained language models? In this work, we attempt to explain and reverse the decline in base capabilities caused by the architecture of FFN-Wider Transformers, seeking to provide some insights. Through analysis, we found the contribution ratio of Multi-Head Attention (a combination function) to pre-trained language modeling is a key factor affecting base capabilities. FFN-Wider Transformers reduce the contribution ratio of this combination function, leading to a decline in base capabilities. We confirmed this by experiments and proposed Combination Enhanced Architecture (CEA) to address the decline in base capabilities of such models. Significantly, we extended our explanation and CEA to Mixture of Experts (MoE) Transformers. We successfully achieved significant improvements in base capabilities on a 14B parameter MoE model, demonstrating the practical application value of our work. This also indicates that our analysis has a certain guiding significance for architecture analysis, architecture improvement and architecture design."
Poster,How Does Black-Box Impact the Learning Guarantee of Stochastic Compositional Optimization?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96688,"Jun Chen, Hong Chen, Bin Gu","Stochastic compositional optimization (SCO) problem constitutes a class of optimization problems characterized by the objective function with a compositional form, including the tasks with known derivatives, such as AUC maximization, and the derivative-free tasks exemplified by black-box vertical federated learning (VFL). From the learning theory perspective, the learning guarantees of SCO algorithms with known derivatives have been studied in the literature. However, the potential impacts of the derivative-free setting on the learning guarantees of SCO remains unclear and merits further investigation. This paper aims to reveal the impacts by developing a theoretical analysis for two derivative-free algorithms, black-box SCGD and SCSC. Specifically, we first provide the sharper generalization upper bounds of convex SCGD and SCSC based on a new stability analysis framework more effective than prior work under some milder conditions, which is further developed to the non-convex case using the almost co-coercivity property of smooth function. Then, we derive the learning guarantees of three black-box variants of non-convex SCGD and SCSC with additional optimization analysis. Comparing these results, we theoretically uncover the impacts that a better gradient estimation brings a tighter learning guarantee and a larger proportion of unknown gradients may lead to a stronger dependence on the gradient estimation quality. Finally, our analysis is applied to two SCO algorithms, FOO-based vertical VFL and VFL-CZOFO, to build the first learning guarantees for VFL that align with the findings of SCGD and SCSC."
Poster,How does Gradient Descent Learn Features --- A Local Analysis for Regularized Two-Layer Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94759,"Mo Zhou, Rong Ge","The ability of learning useful features is one of the major advantages of neural networks. Although recent works show that neural network can operate in a neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime that does not allow feature learning, many works also demonstrate the potential for neural networks to go beyond NTK regime and perform feature learning. Recently, a line of work highlighted the feature learning capabilities of the early stages of gradient-based training. In this paper we consider another mechanism for feature learning via gradient descent through a local convergence analysis. We show that once the loss is below a certain threshold, gradient descent with a carefully regularized objective will capture ground-truth directions. We further strengthen this local convergence analysis by incorporating early-stage feature learning analysis. Our results demonstrate that feature learning not only happens at the initial gradient steps, but can also occur towards the end of training."
Poster,How does Inverse RL Scale to Large State Spaces? A Provably Efficient Approach,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94615,"Filippo Lazzati, Mirco Mutti, Alberto Maria Metelli","In online Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), the learner can collect samples about the dynamics of the environment to improve itsestimate of the reward function. Since IRL suffers from identifiability issues, many theoretical works on online IRL focus on estimating the entire set of rewards that explain the demonstrations, named the *feasible reward set*. However, none of the algorithms available in literature can scale to problems with large state spaces. In this paper, we focus on the online IRL problem in Linear Markov DecisionProcesses (MDPs). We show that the structure offered by Linear MDPs is not sufficient for efficiently estimating the feasible set when the state space is large. As a consequence, we introduce the novel framework of *rewards compatibility*, which generalizes the notion of feasible set, and we develop CATY-IRL, a sample efficient algorithm whose complexity is independent of the size of the state space in Linear MDPs. When restricted to the tabular setting, we demonstrate that CATY-IRL is minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors. As a by-product, we show that Reward-Free Exploration (RFE) enjoys the same worst-case rate, improving over the state-of-the-art lower bound. Finally, we devise a unifying framework for IRL and RFE that may be of independent interest."
Poster,How Does Message Passing Improve Collaborative Filtering?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94445,"Mingxuan Ju, William Shiao, Zhichun Guo, Yanfang Ye, Yozen Liu, Neil Shah, Tong Zhao","Collaborative filtering (CF) has exhibited prominent results for recommender systems and been broadly utilized for real-world applications.A branch of research enhances CF methods by message passing (MP) used in graph neural networks, due to its strong capabilities of extracting knowledge from graph-structured data, like user-item bipartite graphs that naturally exist in CF. They assume that MP helps CF methods in a manner akin to its benefits for graph-based learning tasks in general (e.g., node classification). However, even though MP empirically improves CF, whether or not this assumption is correct still needs verification. To address this gap, we formally investigate why MP helps CF from multiple perspectives and show that many assumptions made by previous works are not entirely accurate. With our curated ablation studies and theoretical analyses, we discover that (i) MP improves the CF performance primarily by additional representations passed from neighbors during the forward pass instead of additional gradient updates to neighbor representations during the model back-propagation and (ii) MP usually helps low-degree nodes more than high-degree nodes.}Utilizing these novel findings, we present Test-time Aggregation for Collaborative Filtering, namely TAG-CF, a test-time augmentation framework that only conducts MP once at inference time. The key novelty of TAG-CF is that it effectively utilizes graph knowledge while circumventing most of notorious computational overheads of MP. Besides, TAG-CF is extremely versatile can be used as a plug-and-play module to enhance representations trained by different CF supervision signals. Evaluated on six datasets (i.e., five academic benchmarks and one real-world industrial dataset), TAG-CF consistently improves the recommendation performance of CF methods without graph by up to 39.2% on cold users and 31.7% on all users, with little to no extra computational overheads. Furthermore, compared with trending graph-enhanced CF methods, TAG-CF delivers comparable or even better performance with less than 1% of their total training times. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/snap-research/Test-time-Aggregation-for-CF."
