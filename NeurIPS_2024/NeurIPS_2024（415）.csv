Poster,Towards Unified Multimodal Editing with Enhanced Knowledge Collaboration,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93873,"Kaihang Pan, Zhaoyu Fan, Juncheng Li, Qifan Yu, Hao Fei, Siliang Tang, Richang Hong, Hanwang Zhang, QIANRU SUN","The swift advancement in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) also presents significant challenges for effective knowledge editing. Current methods, including intrinsic knowledge editing and external knowledge resorting, each possess strengths and weaknesses, struggling to balance the desired properties of reliability, generality, and locality when applied to MLLMs. In this paper, we propose \textbf{UniKE}, a novel multimodal editing method that establishes a unified perspective and paradigm for intrinsic knowledge editing and external knowledge resorting. Both types of knowledge are conceptualized as vectorized key-value memories, with the corresponding editing processes resembling the assimilation and accommodation phases of human cognition, conducted at the same semantic levels.  Within such a unified framework, we further promote knowledge collaboration by disentangling the knowledge representations into the semantic and truthfulness spaces. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, which ensures that the post-edit MLLM simultaneously maintains excellent reliability, generality, and locality. The code for UniKE is available at https://github.com/beepkh/UniKE."
Poster,Towards Universal Mesh Movement Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93817,"Mingrui Zhang, Chunyang Wang, Stephan C. Kramer, Joseph G Wallwork, Siyi Li, Jiancheng Liu, Xiang Chen, Matthew Piggott","Solving complex Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) accurately and efficiently is an essential and challenging problem in all scientific and engineering disciplines. Mesh movement methods provide the capability to improve the accuracy of the numerical solution without increasing the overall mesh degree of freedom count. Conventional sophisticated mesh movement methods are extremely expensive and struggle to handle scenarios with complex boundary geometries. However, existing learning-based methods require re-training from scratch given a different PDE type or boundary geometry, which limits their applicability, and also often suffer from robustness issues in the form of inverted elements. In this paper, we introduce the Universal Mesh Movement Network (UM2N), which -- once trained -- can be applied in a non-intrusive, zero-shot manner to move meshes with different size distributions and structures, for solvers applicable to different PDE types and boundary geometries. UM2N consists of a Graph Transformer (GT) encoder for extracting features and a Graph Attention Network (GAT) based decoder for moving the mesh. We evaluate our method on advection and Navier-Stokes based examples, as well as a real-world tsunami simulation case. Our method out-performs existing learning-based mesh movement methods in terms of the benchmarks described above. In comparison to the conventional sophisticated Monge-Ampère PDE-solver based method, our approach not only significantly accelerates mesh movement, but also proves effective in scenarios where the conventional method fails.

Poster,Towards Unsupervised Model Selection for Domain Adaptive Object Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94134,"Hengfu Yu, Jinhong Deng, Wen Li, Lixin Duan","Evaluating the performance of deep models in new scenarios has drawn increasing attention in recent years due to the wide application of deep learning techniques in various fields. However, while it is possible to collect data from new scenarios, the annotations are not always available. Existing Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) works usually report their performance by selecting the best model on the validation set or even the test set of the target domain, which is highly impractical in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised model selection approach for domain adaptive object detection, which is able to select almost the optimal model for the target domain without using any target labels. Our approach is based on the flat minima principle, i.e., models located in the flat minima region in the parameter space usually exhibit excellent generalization ability. However, traditional methods require labeled data to evaluate how well a model is located in the flat minima region, which is unrealistic for the DAOD task. Therefore, we design a Detection Adaptation Score (DAS) approach to approximately measure the flat minima without using target labels. We show via a generalization bound that the flatness can be deemed as model variance, while the minima depend on the domain distribution distance for the DAOD task. Accordingly, we propose a Flatness Index Score (FIS) to assess the flatness by measuring the classification and localization fluctuation before and after perturbations of model parameters and a Prototypical Distance Ratio (PDR) score to seek the minima by measuring the transferability and discriminability of the models. In this way, the proposed DAS approach can effectively represent the degree of flat minima and evaluate the model generalization ability on the target domain. We have conducted extensive experiments on various DAOD benchmarks and approaches, and the experimental results show that the proposed DAS correlates well with the performance of DAOD models and can be used as an effective tool for model selection after training. The code will be released at https://github.com/HenryYu23/DAS."
Poster,Towards Visual Text Design Transfer Across Languages,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97750,"Yejin Choi, Jiwan Chung, Sumin Shim, Giyeong Oh, Youngjae Yu","Visual text design plays a critical role in conveying themes, emotions, and atmospheres in multimodal formats such as film posters and album covers. Translating these visual and textual elements across languages extends the concept of translation beyond mere text, requiring the adaptation of aesthetic and stylistic features. To address this, we introduce a novel task of Multimodal Style Translation (MuST-Bench), a benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of visual text generation models to perform translation across different writing systems while preserving design intent.Our initial experiments on MuST-Bench reveal that existing visual text generation models struggle with the proposed task due to the inadequacy of textual descriptions in conveying visual design.In response, we introduce SIGIL, a framework for multimodal style translation that eliminates the need for style descriptions.SIGIL enhances image generation models through three innovations: glyph latent for multilingual settings, pre-trained VAEs for stable style guidance, and an OCR model with reinforcement learning feedback for optimizing readable character generation. SIGIL outperforms existing baselines by achieving superior style consistency and legibility while maintaining visual fidelity, setting itself apart from traditional description-based approaches. We release MuST-Bench publicly for broader use and exploration https://huggingface.co/datasets/yejinc/MuST-Bench."
Poster,Toxicity Detection for Free,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96583,"Zhanhao Hu, Julien Piet, Geng Zhao, Jiantao Jiao, David Wagner","Current LLMs are generally aligned to follow safety requirements and tend to refuse toxic prompts. However, LLMs can fail to refuse toxic prompts or be overcautious and refuse benign examples. In addition, state-of-the-art toxicity detectors have low TPRs at low FPR, incurring high costs in real-world applications where toxic examples are rare. In this paper, we introduce Moderation Using LLM Introspection (MULI), which detects toxic prompts using the information extracted directly from LLMs themselves. We found we can distinguish between benign and toxic prompts from the distribution of the first response token's logits. Using this idea, we build a robust detector of toxic prompts using a sparse logistic regression model on the first response token logits. Our scheme outperforms SOTA detectors under multiple metrics."
Poster,TPC: Test-time Procrustes Calibration for Diffusion-based Human Image Animation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94092,"Sunjae Yoon, Gwanhyeong Koo, Younghwan Lee, Chang Yoo","Human image animation aims to generate a human motion video from the inputs of a reference human image and a target motion video. Current diffusion-based image animation systems exhibit high precision in transferring human identity into targeted motion, yet they still exhibit irregular quality in their outputs. Their optimal precision is achieved only when the physical compositions (i.e., scale and rotation) of the human shapes in the reference image and target pose frame are aligned. In the absence of such alignment, there is a noticeable decline in fidelity and consistency. Especially, in real-world environments, this compositional misalignment commonly occurs, posing significant challenges to the practical usage of current systems. To this end, we propose Test-time Procrustes Calibration (TPC), which enhances the robustness of diffusion-based image animation systems by maintaining optimal performance even when faced with compositional misalignment, effectively addressing real-world scenarios. The TPC provides a calibrated reference image for the diffusion model, enhancing its capability to understand the correspondence between human shapes in the reference and target images. Our method is simple and can be applied to any diffusion-based image animation system in a model-agnostic manner, improving the effectiveness at test time without additional training."
Poster,TPR: Topology-Preserving Reservoirs for Generalized Zero-Shot Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92938,"Hui Chen, Yanbin Liu, Yongqiang Ma, Nanning Zheng, Xin Yu","Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown excellent performance for zero-shot classification. Based on CLIP, recent methods design various learnable prompts to evaluate the zero-shot generalization capability on a base-to-novel setting. This setting assumes test samples are already divided into either base or novel classes, limiting its application to realistic scenarios. In this paper, we focus on a more challenging and practical setting: generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL), i.e., testing with no information about the base/novel division. To address this challenging zero-shot problem, we introduce two unique designs that enable us to classify an image without the need of knowing whether it comes from seen or unseen classes. Firstly, most existing methods only adopt a single latent space to align visual and linguistic features, which has a limited ability to represent complex visual-linguistic patterns, especially for fine-grained tasks. Instead, we propose a dual-space feature alignment module that effectively augments the latent space with a novel attribute space induced by a well-devised attribute reservoir. In particular, the attribute reservoir consists of a static vocabulary and learnable tokens complementing each other for flexible control over feature granularity. Secondly, finetuning CLIP models (e.g., prompt learning) on seen base classes usually sacrifices the model's original generalization capability on unseen novel classes. To mitigate this issue, we present a new topology-preserving objective that can enforce feature topology structures of the combined base and novel classes to resemble the topology of CLIP. In this manner, our model will inherit the generalization ability of CLIP through maintaining the pairwise class angles in the attribute space. Extensive experiments on twelve object recognition datasets demonstrate that our model, termed Topology-Preserving Reservoir (TPR), outperforms strong baselines including both prompt learning and conventional generative-based zero-shot methods."
Poster,"Trace is the Next AutoDiff: Generative Optimization with Rich Feedback, Execution Traces, and LLMs",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93431,"Ching-An Cheng, Allen Nie, Adith Swaminathan","We study a class of optimization problems motivated by automating the design and update of AI systems like coding assistants, robots, and copilots. AutoDiff frameworks, like PyTorch, enable efficient end-to-end optimization of differentiable systems. However, general computational workflows can be non-differentiable and involve rich feedback (e.g. console output or user’s responses), heterogeneous parameters (e.g. prompts, codes), and intricate objectives (beyond maximizing a score). We investigate end-to-end generative optimization – using generative models such as LLMs within the optimizer for automatic updating of general computational workflows. We discover that workflow execution traces are akin to back-propagated gradients in AutoDiff and can provide key information to interpret feedback for efficient optimization. Formally, we frame a new mathematical setup, Optimization with Trace Oracle (OPTO). In OPTO, an optimizer receives an execution trace along with feedback on the computed output and updates parameters iteratively. We provide a Python library, Trace, that efficiently converts a workflow optimization problem into an OPTO instance using PyTorch-like syntax. Using Trace, we develop a general LLM-based generative optimizer called OptoPrime. In empirical studies, we find that OptoPrime is capable of first-order numerical optimization, prompt optimization, hyper-parameter tuning, robot controller design, code debugging, etc., and is often competitive with specialized optimizers for each domain. We envision Trace as an open research platform for devising novel generative optimizers and developing the next generation of interactive learning agents.

Poster,Tracing Hyperparameter Dependencies for Model Parsing via Learnable Graph Pooling Network,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94729,"Xiao Guo, Vishal Asnani, Sijia Liu, Xiaoming Liu","\textit{Model Parsing} defines the task of predicting hyperparameters of the generative model (GM), given a GM-generated image as the input. Since a diverse set of hyperparameters is jointly employed by the generative model, and dependencies often exist among them, it is crucial to learn these hyperparameter dependencies for improving the model parsing performance. To explore such important dependencies, we propose a novel model parsing method called Learnable Graph Pooling Network (LGPN), in which we formulate model parsing as a graph node classification problem, using graph nodes and edges to represent hyperparameters and their dependencies, respectively. Furthermore, LGPN incorporates a learnable pooling-unpooling mechanism tailored to model parsing, which adaptively learns hyperparameter dependencies of GMs used to generate the input image. Also, we introduce a Generation Trace Capturing Network (GTC) that can efficiently identify generation traces of input images, enhancing the understanding of generated images' provenances.Empirically, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in model parsing and its extended applications, showing the superiority of the proposed LGPN."
Poster,TrackIME: Enhanced Video Point Tracking via Instance Motion Estimation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94283,"Seong Hyeon Park, Huiwon Jang, Byungwoo Jeon, Sukmin Yun, Paul Hongsuck Seo, Jinwoo Shin","Tracking points in video frames is essential for understanding video content. However, the task is fundamentally hindered by the computation demands for brute-force correspondence matching across the frames. As the current models down-sample the frame resolutions to mitigate this challenge, they fall short in accurately representing point trajectories due to information truncation. Instead, we address the challenge by pruning the search space for point tracking and let the model process only the important regions of the frames without down-sampling. Our first key idea is to identify the object instance and its trajectory over the frames, then prune the regions of the frame that do not contain the instance. Concretely, to estimate the instance’s trajectory, we track a group of points on the instance and aggregate their motion trajectories. Furthermore, to deal with the occlusions in complex scenes, we propose to compensate for the occluded points while tracking. To this end, we introduce a unified framework that jointly performs point tracking and segmentation, providing synergistic effects between the two tasks. For example, the segmentation results enable a tracking model to avoid the occluded points referring to the instance mask, and conversely, the improved tracking results can help to produce more accurate segmentation masks. Our framework can be easily incorporated with various tracking models, and we demonstrate its efficacy for enhanced point tracking throughout extensive experiments. For example, on the recent TAP-Vid benchmark, our framework consistently improves all baselines, e.g., up to 13.5% improvement on the average Jaccard metric."
