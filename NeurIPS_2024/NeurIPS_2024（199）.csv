Poster,Improving Neural Network Surface Processing with Principal Curvatures,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96354,"Josquin Harrison, James Benn, Maxime Sermesant","The modern study and use of surfaces is a research topic grounded in centuries of mathematical and empirical inquiry. From a mathematical point of view, curvature is an invariant that characterises the intrinsic geometry and the extrinsic shape of a surface. Yet, in modern applications the focus has shifted away from finding expressive representations of surfaces, and towards the design of efficient neural network architectures to process them. The literature suggests a tendency to either overlook the representation of the processed surface, or use overcomplicated representations whose ability to capture the essential features of a surface is opaque. We propose using curvature as the input of neural network architectures for surface processing, and explore this proposition through experiments making use of the shape operator. Our results show that using curvature as input leads to significant a increase in performance on segmentation and classification tasks, while allowing far less computational overhead than current methods."
Poster,Improving Neural ODE Training with Temporal Adaptive Batch Normalization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96259,"Su Zheng, Zhengqi Gao, Fan-Keng Sun, Duane Boning, Bei Yu, Martin D. Wong","Neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) is a family of continuous-depth neural networks where the evolution of hidden states is governed by learnable temporal derivatives. We identify a significant limitation in applying traditional Batch Normalization (BN) to Neural ODEs, due to a fundamental mismatch --- BN was initially designed for discrete neural networks with no temporal dimension, whereas Neural ODEs operate continuously over time. To bridge this gap, we introduce temporal adaptive Batch Normalization (TA-BN), a novel technique that acts as the continuous-time analog to traditional BN. Our empirical findings reveal that TA-BN enables the stacking of more layers within Neural ODEs, enhancing their performance. Moreover, when confined to a model architecture consisting of a single Neural ODE followed by a linear layer, TA-BN achieves 91.1\% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 2.2 million parameters, making it the first \texttt{unmixed} Neural ODE architecture to approach MobileNetV2-level parameter efficiency. Extensive numerical experiments on image classification and physical system modeling substantiate the superiority of TA-BN compared to baseline methods."
Poster,Improving Robustness of 3D Point Cloud Recognition from a Fourier Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96641,"Yibo Miao, Yinpeng Dong, Jinlai Zhang, Lijia Yu, Xiao Yang, Xiao-Shan Gao","Although 3D point cloud recognition has achieved substantial progress on standard benchmarks, the typical models are vulnerable to point cloud corruptions, leading to security threats in real-world applications. To improve the corruption robustness, various data augmentation methods have been studied, but they are mainly limited to the spatial domain. As the point cloud has low information density and significant spatial redundancy, it is challenging to analyze the effects of corruptions. In this paper, we focus on the frequency domain to observe the underlying structure of point clouds and their corruptions. Through graph Fourier transform (GFT), we observe a correlation between the corruption robustness of point cloud recognition models and their sensitivity to different frequency bands, which is measured by the GFT spectrum of the model’s Jacobian matrix. To reduce the sensitivity and improve the corruption robustness, we propose Frequency Adversarial Training (FAT) that adopts frequency-domain adversarial examples as data augmentation to train robust point cloud recognition models against corruptions. Theoretically, we provide a guarantee of FAT on its out-of-distribution generalization performance. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments with various network architectures to validate the effectiveness of FAT, which achieves the new state-of-the-art results."
Poster,Improving robustness to corruptions with multiplicative weight perturbations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95542,"Quoc Trung Trinh, Markus Heinonen, Luigi Acerbi, Samuel Kaski","Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel on clean images but struggle with corrupted ones. Incorporating specific corruptions into the data augmentation pipeline can improve robustness to those corruptions but may harm performance on clean images and other types of distortion. In this paper, we introduce an alternative approach that improves the robustness of DNNs to a wide range of corruptions without compromising accuracy on clean images. We first demonstrate that input perturbations can be mimicked by multiplicative perturbations in the weight space. Leveraging this, we propose Data Augmentation via Multiplicative Perturbation (DAMP), a training method that optimizes DNNs under random multiplicative weight perturbations. We also examine the recently proposed Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (ASAM) and show that it optimizes DNNs under adversarial multiplicative weight perturbations. Experiments on image classification datasets (CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet and ImageNet) and neural network architectures (ResNet50, ViT-S/16, ViT-B/16) show that DAMP enhances model generalization performance in the presence of corruptions across different settings. Notably, DAMP is able to train a ViT-S/16 on ImageNet from scratch, reaching the top-1 error of 23.7% which is comparable to ResNet50 without extensive data augmentations."
Poster,Improving self-training under distribution shifts via anchored confidence with theoretical guarantees,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94596,"Taejong Joo, Diego Klabjan","Self-training often falls short under distribution shifts due to an increased discrepancy between prediction confidence and actual accuracy. This typically necessitates computationally demanding methods such as neighborhood or ensemble-based label corrections. Drawing inspiration from insights on early learning regularization, we develop a principled method to improve self-training under distribution shifts based on temporal consistency. Specifically, we build an uncertainty-aware temporal ensemble with a simple relative thresholding. Then, this ensemble smooths noisy pseudo labels to promote selective temporal consistency. We show that our temporal ensemble is asymptotically correct and our label smoothing technique can reduce the optimality gap of self-training. Our extensive experiments validate that our approach consistently improves self-training performances by 8% to 16% across diverse distribution shift scenarios without a computational overhead. Besides, our method exhibits attractive properties, such as improved calibration performance and robustness to different hyperparameter choices."
Poster,Improving Sparse Decomposition of Language Model Activations with Gated Sparse Autoencoders,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92961,"Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Arthur Conmy, Lewis Smith, Tom Lieberum, Vikrant Varma, Janos Kramar, Rohin Shah, Neel Nanda","Recent work has found that sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are an effective technique for unsupervised discovery of interpretable features in language models' (LMs) activations, by finding sparse, linear reconstructions of those activations. We introduce the Gated Sparse Autoencoder (Gated SAE), which achieves a Pareto improvement over training with prevailing methods. In SAEs, the L1 penalty used to encourage sparsity introduces many undesirable biases, such as shrinkage -- systematic underestimation of feature activations. The key insight of Gated SAEs is to separate the functionality of (a) determining which directions to use and (b) estimating the magnitudes of those directions: this enables us to apply the L1 penalty only to the former, limiting the scope of undesirable side effects. Through training SAEs on LMs of up to 7B parameters we find that, in typical hyper-parameter ranges, Gated SAEs solve shrinkage, are similarly interpretable, and require half as many firing features to achieve comparable reconstruction fidelity."
Poster,Improving Subgroup Robustness via Data Selection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93208,"Saachi Jain, Kimia Hamidieh, Kristian Georgiev, Andrew Ilyas, Marzyeh Ghassemi, Aleksander Madry","Machine learning models can often fail on subgroups that are underrepresentedduring training. While dataset balancing can improve performance onunderperforming groups, it requires access to training group annotations and canend up removing large portions of the dataset. In this paper, we introduceData Debiasing with Datamodels (D3M), a debiasing approachwhich isolates and removes specific training examples that drive the model'sfailures on minority groups. Our approach enables us to efficiently traindebiased classifiers while removing only a small number of examples, and doesnot require training group annotations or additional hyperparameter tuning."
Poster,Improving Temporal Link Prediction via Temporal Walk Matrix Projection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95017,"Xiaodong Lu, Leilei Sun, Tongyu Zhu, Weifeng Lv","Temporal link prediction, aiming at predicting future interactions among entities based on historical interactions, is crucial for a series of real-world applications. Although previous methods have demonstrated the importance of relative encodings for effective temporal link prediction, computational efficiency remains a major concern in constructing these encodings. Moreover, existing relative encodings are usually constructed based on structural connectivity, where temporal information is seldom considered. To address the aforementioned issues, we first analyze existing relative encodings and unify them as a function of temporal walk matrices. This unification establishes a connection between relative encodings and temporal walk matrices, providing a more principled way for analyzing and designing relative encodings. Based on this analysis, we propose a new temporal graph neural network called TPNet, which introduces a temporal walk matrix that incorporates the time decay effect to simultaneously consider both temporal and structural information. Moreover, TPNet designs a random feature propagation mechanism with theoretical guarantees to implicitly maintain the temporal walk matrices, which improves the computation and storage efficiency. Experimental results on 13 benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness and efficiency of TPNet, where TPNet outperforms other baselines on most datasets and achieves a maximum speedup of $33.3 \times$ compared to the SOTA baseline."
Poster,Improving the Learning Capability of Small-size Image Restoration Network by Deep Fourier Shifting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96728,man zhou,"State-of-the-art image restoration methods currently face challenges in terms of computational requirements and performance, making them impractical for deployment on edge devices such as phones and resource-limited devices. As a result, there is a need to develop alternative solutions with efficient designs that can achieve comparable performance to transformer or large-kernel methods. This motivates our research to explore techniques for improving the capability of small-size image restoration standing on the success secret of large receptive filed.Targeting at expanding receptive filed, spatial-shift operator tailored for efficient spatial communication and  has achieved remarkable advances in high-level image classification tasks, like $S^2$-MLP and ShiftVit. However, its potential has rarely been explored in low-level image restoration tasks. The underlying reason behind this obstacle is that image restoration is sensitive to the spatial shift that occurs due to severe region-aware information loss, which exhibits a different behavior from high-level tasks. To address this challenge and unleash the potential of spatial shift for image restoration, we propose an information-lossless shifting operator, i.e., Deep Fourier Shifting, that is customized for image restoration. To develop our proposed operator, we first revisit the principle of shift operator and apply it to the Fourier domain, where the shift operator can be modeled in an information-lossless Fourier cycling manner. Inspired by Fourier cycling, we design two variants of Deep Fourier Shifting, namely the amplitude-phase variant and the real-imaginary variant. These variants are generic operators that can be directly plugged into existing image restoration networks as a drop-in replacement for the standard convolution unit, consuming fewer parameters. Extensive experiments across multiple low-level tasks including image denoising, low-light image enhancement, guided image super-resolution, and image de-blurring demonstrate consistent performance gains obtained by our Deep Fourier Shifting while reducing the computation burden. Additionally, ablation studies verify the robustness of the shift displacement with stable performance improvement."
Poster,Improving the Training of Rectified Flows,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93758,"Sangyun Lee, Zinan Lin, Giulia Fanti","Diffusion models have shown great promise for image and video generation, but sampling from state-of-the-art models requires expensive numerical integration of a generative ODE.    One approach for tackling this problem is rectified flows, which iteratively learn smooth ODE paths that are less susceptible to truncation error.    However, rectified flows still require a relatively large number of function evaluations (NFEs).    In this work, we propose improved techniques for training rectified flows, allowing them to compete with knowledge distillation methods even in the low NFE setting.    Our main insight is that under realistic settings, a single iteration of the Reflow algorithm for training rectified flows is sufficient to learn nearly straight trajectories; hence, the current practice of using multiple Reflow iterations is unnecessary.    We thus propose techniques to improve one-round training of rectified flows, including a U-shaped timestep distribution and LPIPS-Huber premetric.    With these techniques, we improve the FID of the previous 2-rectified flow by up to 75\% in the 1 NFE setting on CIFAR-10.    On ImageNet 64$\times$64, our improved rectified flow outperforms the state-of-the-art distillation methods    such as consistency distillation and progressive distillation in both one-step and two-step settings and rivals the performance of improved consistency training (iCT) in FID.
