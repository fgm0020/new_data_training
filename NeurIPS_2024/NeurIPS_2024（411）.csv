Poster,Towards Comprehensive Detection of Chinese Harmful Memes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97711,"Junyu Lu, Bo Xu, Xiaokun Zhang, Hongbo Wang, Haohao Zhu, Dongyu Zhang, Liang Yang, Hongfei Lin","Harmful memes have proliferated on the Chinese Internet, while research on detecting Chinese harmful memes significantly lags behind due to the absence of reliable datasets and effective detectors.To this end, we present the comprehensive detection of Chinese harmful memes.We introduce ToxiCN MM, the first Chinese harmful meme dataset, which consists of 12,000 samples with fine-grained annotations for meme types. Additionally, we propose a baseline detector, Multimodal Knowledge Enhancement (MKE), designed to incorporate contextual information from meme content, thereby enhancing the model's understanding of Chinese memes.In the evaluation phase, we conduct extensive quantitative experiments and qualitative analyses on multiple baselines, including LLMs and our MKE. Experimental results indicate that detecting Chinese harmful memes is challenging for existing models, while demonstrating the effectiveness of MKE."
Poster,Towards Croppable Implicit Neural Representations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93932,"Maor Ashkenazi, Eran Treister","Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have peaked interest in recent years due to their ability to encode natural signals using neural networks. While INRs allow for useful applications such as interpolating new coordinates and signal compression, their black-box nature makes it difficult to modify them post-training. In this paper we explore the idea of editable INRs, and specifically focus on the widely used cropping operation. To this end, we present Local-Global SIRENs - a novel INR architecture that supports cropping by design. Local-Global SIRENs are based on combining local and global feature extraction for signal encoding. What makes their design unique is the ability to effortlessly remove specific portions of an encoded signal, with a proportional weight decrease. This is achieved by eliminating the corresponding weights from the network, without the need for retraining. We further show how this architecture can be used to support the straightforward extension of previously encoded signals. Beyond signal editing, we examine how the Local-Global approach can accelerate training, enhance encoding of various signals, improve downstream performance, and be applied to modern INRs such as INCODE, highlighting its potential and flexibility.

Poster,Towards Diverse Device Heterogeneous Federated Learning via Task Arithmetic Knowledge Integration,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93045,"Mahdi Morafah, Vyacheslav Kungurtsev, Hojin Chang, Chen Chen, Bill Lin","Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative machine learning, while preserving user data privacy. Despite its potential, standard FL algorithms lack support for diverse heterogeneous device prototypes, which vary significantly in model and dataset sizes---from small IoT devices to large workstations. This limitation is only partially addressed by existing knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, which often fail to transfer knowledge effectively across a broad spectrum of device prototypes with varied capabilities. This failure primarily stems from two issues: the dilution of informative logits from more capable devices by those from less capable ones, and the use of a single integrated logits as the distillation target across all devices, which neglects their individual learning capacities and and the unique contributions of each device. To address these challenges, we introduce TAKFL, a novel KD-based framework that treats the knowledge transfer from each device prototype's ensemble as a separate task, independently distilling each to preserve its unique contributions and avoid dilution. TAKFL also incorporates a KD-based self-regularization technique to mitigate the issues related to the noisy and unsupervised ensemble distillation process. To integrate the separately distilled knowledge, we introduce an adaptive task arithmetic knowledge integration process, allowing each student model to customize the knowledge integration for optimal performance. Additionally, we present theoretical results demonstrating the effectiveness of task arithmetic in transferring knowledge across heterogeneous device prototypes with varying capacities. Comprehensive evaluations of our method across both computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) tasks demonstrate that TAKFL achieves state-of-the-art results in a variety of datasets and settings, significantly outperforming existing KD-based methods.

Poster,Towards Dynamic Message Passing on Graphs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96687,"Junshu Sun, Chenxue Yang, Xiangyang Ji, Qingming Huang, Shuhui Wang","Message passing plays a vital role in graph neural networks (GNNs) for effective feature learning. However, the over-reliance on input topology diminishes the efficacy of message passing and restricts the ability of GNNs. Despite efforts to mitigate the reliance, existing study encounters message-passing bottlenecks or high computational expense problems, which invokes the demands for flexible message passing with low complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic message-passing mechanism for GNNs. It projects graph nodes and learnable pseudo nodes into a common space with measurable spatial relations between them. With nodes moving in the space, their evolving relations facilitate flexible pathway construction for a dynamic message-passing process. Associating pseudo nodes to input graphs with their measured relations, graph nodes can communicate with each other intermediately through pseudo nodes under linear complexity. We further develop a GNN model named $\mathtt{N^2}$ based on our dynamic message-passing mechanism. $\mathtt{N^2}$ employs a single recurrent layer to recursively generate the displacements of nodes and construct optimal dynamic pathways. Evaluation on eighteen benchmarks demonstrates the superior performance of $\mathtt{N^2}$ over popular GNNs. $\mathtt{N^2}$ successfully scales to large-scale benchmarks and requires significantly fewer parameters for graph classification with the shared recurrent layer."
Poster,Towards Editing Time Series,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93468,"Baoyu Jing, Shuqi Gu, Tianyu Chen, Zhiyu Yang, Dongsheng Li, Jingrui He, Kan Ren","Synthesizing time series data is pivotal in modern society, aiding effective decision making and ensuring privacy preservation in various scenarios. Time series are associated with various attributes, including trends, seasonality, and external information such as location. Recent research has predominantly focused on random unconditional synthesis or conditional synthesis. Nonetheless, these paradigms generate time series from scratch and are incapable of manipulating existing time series samples. This paper introduces a novel task, called Time Series Editing (TSE), to synthesize time series by manipulating existing time series. The objective is to modify the given time series according to the specified attributes while preserving other properties unchanged. This task is not trivial due to the inadequacy of data coverage and the intricate relationships between time series and their attributes. To address these issues, we introduce a novel diffusion model, called TEdit. The proposed TEdit is trained using a novel bootstrap learning algorithm that effectively enhances the coverage of the original data. It is also equipped with an innovative multi-resolution modeling and generation paradigm to capture the complex relationships between time series and their attributes. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of TEdit for editing specified attributes upon the existing time series data. The project page is at https://seqml.github.io/tse."
Poster,Towards Effective Planning Strategies for Dynamic Opinion Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95585,"Bharath Muppasani, Protik Nag, Vignesh Narayanan, Biplav Srivastava, Michael Huhns","In this study, we investigate the under-explored intervention planning aimed at disseminating accurate information within dynamic opinion networks by leveraging learning strategies. Intervention planning involves identifying key nodes (search) and exerting control (e.g., disseminating accurate/official information through the nodes) to mitigate the influence of misinformation. However, as the network size increases, the problem becomes computationally intractable. To address this, we first introduce a ranking algorithm to identify key nodes for disseminating accurate information, which facilitates the training of neural network (NN) classifiers that provide generalized solutions for the search and planning problems. Second, we mitigate the complexity of label generation—which becomes challenging as the network grows—by developing a reinforcement learning (RL)-based centralized dynamic planning framework. We analyze these NN-based planners for opinion networks governed by two dynamic propagation models. Each model incorporates both binary and continuous opinion and trust representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ranking algorithm-based classifiers provide plans that enhance infection rate control, especially with increased action budgets for small networks. Further, we observe that the reward strategies focusing on key metrics, such as the number of susceptible nodes and infection rates, outperform those prioritizing faster blocking strategies. Additionally, our findings reveal that graph convolutional network (GCN)-based planners facilitate scalable centralized plans that achieve lower infection rates (higher control) across various network configurations (e.g., Watts-Strogatz topology, varying action budgets, varying initial infected nodes, and varying degree of infected nodes)."
Poster,Towards Efficient and Optimal Covariance-Adaptive Algorithms for Combinatorial Semi-Bandits,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95320,"Julien Zhou, Pierre Gaillard, Thibaud Rahier, Houssam Zenati, Julyan Arbel","We address the problem of stochastic combinatorial semi-bandits, where a player selects among $P$ actions from the power set of a set containing $d$ base items. Adaptivity to the problem's structure is essential in order to obtain optimal regret upper bounds. As estimating the coefficients of a covariance matrix can be manageable in practice, leveraging them should improve the regret. We design ``optimistic''  covariance-adaptive algorithms relying on online estimations of the covariance structure, called OLS-UCB-C and COS-V (only the variances for the latter). They both yields improved gap-free regret. Although COS-V can be slightly suboptimal, it improves on computational complexity by taking inspiration from Thompson Sampling approaches. It is the first sampling-based algorithm satisfying a $\sqrt{T}$ gap-free regret (up to poly-logs). We also show that in some cases, our approach efficiently leverages the semi-bandit feedback and outperforms bandit feedback approaches, not only in exponential regimes where $P\gg d$ but also when $P\leq d$, which is not covered by existing analyses."
Poster,"Toward Self-Improvement of LLMs via Imagination, Searching, and Criticizing",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93337,"Ye Tian, Baolin Peng, Linfeng Song, Lifeng Jin, Dian Yu, Lei Han, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu","Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on various tasks, they still struggle with scenarios that involves complex reasoning and planning. Self-correction and self-learning emerge as viable solutions, employing strategies that allow LLMs to refine their outputs and learn from self-assessed rewards. Yet, the efficacy of LLMs in self-refining its response, particularly in complex reasoning and planning task, remains dubious. In this paper, we introduce AlphaLLM for the self-improvements of LLMs, which integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with LLMs to establish a self-improving loop, thereby enhancing the capabilities of LLMs without additional annotations. Drawing inspiration from the success of AlphaGo, AlphaLLM addresses the unique challenges of combining MCTS with LLM for self-improvement, including data scarcity, the vastness search spaces of language tasks, and the subjective nature of feedback in language tasks. AlphaLLM is comprised of prompt synthesis component, an efficient MCTS approach tailored for language tasks, and a trio of critic models for precise feedback. Our experimental results in mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that AlphaLLM significantly enhances the performance of LLMs without additional annotations, showing the potential for self-improvement in LLMs."
Poster,Toward Semantic Gaze Target Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96207,"Samy Tafasca, Anshul Gupta, Victor Bros, Jean-marc Odobez","From the onset of infanthood, humans naturally develop the ability to closely observe and interpret the visual gaze of others. This skill, known as gaze following, holds significance in developmental theory as it enables us to grasp another person’s mental state, emotions, intentions, and more. In computer vision, gaze following is defined as the prediction of the pixel coordinates where a person in the image is focusing their attention. Existing methods in this research area have predominantly centered on pinpointing the gaze target by predicting a gaze heatmap or gaze point. However, a notable drawback of this approach is its limited practical value in gaze applications, as mere localization may not fully capture our primary interest — understanding the underlying semantics, such as the nature of the gaze target, rather than just its 2D pixel location. To address this gap, we extend the gaze following task, and introduce a novel architecture that simultaneously predicts the localization and semantic label of the gaze target. We devise a pseudo-annotation pipeline for the GazeFollow dataset, propose a new benchmark, develop an experimental protocol and design a suitable baseline for comparison. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on the main GazeFollow benchmark for localization and achieves competitive results in the recognition task on both datasets compared to the baseline, with 40% fewer parameters"
Poster,Towards Estimating Bounds on the Effect of Policies under Unobserved Confounding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93295,"Alexis Bellot, Silvia Chiappa","As many practical fields transition to provide personalized decisions, data is increasingly relevant to support the evaluation of candidate plans and policies (e.g., guidelines for the treatment of disease, government directives, etc.). In the machine learning literature, significant efforts have been put into developing machinery to predict the effectiveness of policies efficiently. The challenge is that, in practice, the effectiveness of a candidate policy is not always identifiable, i.e., not uniquely estimable from the combination of the available data and assumptions about the domain at hand (e.g., encoded in a causal graph). In this paper, we develop graphical characterizations and estimation tools to bound the effect of policies given a causal graph and observational data collected in non-identifiable settings. Specifically, our contributions are two-fold: (1) we derive analytical bounds for general probabilistic and conditional policies that are tighter than existing results, (2) we develop an estimation framework to estimate bounds from finite samples, applicable in higher-dimensional spaces and continuously-valued data. We further show that the resulting estimators have favourable statistical properties such as fast convergence and robustness to model misspecification."
