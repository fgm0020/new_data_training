Poster,"A Flexible, Equivariant Framework for Subgraph GNNs via Graph Products and Graph Coarsening",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96301,"Guy Bar-Shalom, Yam Eitan, Fabrizio Frasca, Haggai Maron","Subgraph GNNs enhance message-passing GNNs expressivity by representing graphs as sets of subgraphs, demonstrating impressive performance across various tasks. However, their scalability is hindered by the need to process large numbers of subgraphs. While previous approaches attempted to generate smaller subsets of subgraphs through random or learnable sampling, these methods often yielded suboptimal selections or were limited to small subset sizes, ultimately compromising their effectiveness. This paper introduces a new Subgraph GNN framework to address these issues. Our approach diverges from most previous methods by associating subgraphs with node clusters rather than with individual nodes. We show that the resulting collection of subgraphs can be viewed as the product of coarsened and original graphs, unveiling a new connectivity structure on which we perform generalized message passing.Crucially, controlling the coarsening function enables meaningful selection of any number of subgraphs. In addition, we reveal novel permutation symmetries in the resulting node feature tensor, characterize associated linear equivariant layers, and integrate them into our Subgraph GNN. We also introduce novel node marking strategies and provide a theoretical analysis of their expressive power and other key aspects of our approach. Extensive experiments on multiple graph learning benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more flexible than previous approaches, as it can seamlessly handle any number of subgraphs, while consistently outperforming baseline approaches.

Poster,A Foundation Model for Zero-shot Logical Query Reasoning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95712,"Michael Galkin, Jincheng Zhou, Bruno Ribeiro, Jian Tang, Zhaocheng Zhu","Complex logical query answering (CLQA) in knowledge graphs (KGs) goes beyond simple KG completion and aims at answering compositional queries comprised of multiple projections and logical operations. Existing CLQA methods that learn parameters bound to certain entity or relation vocabularies can only be applied to the graph they are trained on which requires substantial training time before being deployed on a new graph. Here we present UltraQuery, the first foundation model for inductive reasoning that can zero-shot answer logical queries on any KG. The core idea of UltraQuery is to derive both projections and logical operations as vocabulary-independent functions which generalize to new entities and relations in any KG.With the projection operation initialized from a pre-trained inductive KG completion model, UltraQuery can solve CLQA on any KG after finetuning on a single dataset. Experimenting on 23 datasets, UltraQuery in the zero-shot inference mode shows competitive or better query answering performance than best available baselines and sets a new state of the art on 15 of them."
Poster,A Framework for Bilevel Optimization on Riemannian Manifolds,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95558,"Andi Han, Bamdev Mishra, Pratik Kumar Jawanpuria, Akiko Takeda","Bilevel optimization has gained prominence in various applications. In this study, we introduce a framework for solving bilevel optimization problems, where the variables in both the lower and upper levels are constrained on Riemannian manifolds. We present several hypergradient estimation strategies on manifolds and analyze their estimation errors. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive convergence and complexity analyses for the proposed hypergradient descent algorithm on manifolds. We also extend our framework to encompass stochastic bilevel optimization and incorporate the use of general retraction. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated through several applications."
Poster,A Full-duplex Speech Dialogue Scheme Based On Large Language Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94688,"Peng Wang, Songshuo Lu, Yaohua Tang, Sijie Yan, Wei Xia, Yuanjun Xiong","We present a generative dialogue system capable of operating in a full-duplex manner, allowing for seamless interaction. It is based on a large language model (LLM) carefully aligned to be aware of a perception module, a motor function module, and the concept of a simple finite state machine (called neural FSM) with two states. The perception and motor function modules operate in tandem, allowing the system to speak and listen to the user simultaneously. The LLM generates textual tokens for inquiry responses and makes autonomous decisions to start responding to, wait for, or interrupt the user by emitting control tokens to the neural FSM. All these tasks of the LLM are carried out as next token prediction on a serialized view of the dialogue in real-time. In automatic quality evaluations simulating real-life interaction, the proposed system reduces the average conversation response latency by more than threefold compared with LLM-based half-duplex dialogue systems while responding within less than 500 milliseconds in more than 50% of evaluated interactions. Running an LLM with only 8 billion parameters, our system exhibits an 8% higher interruption precision rate than the best available commercial LLM for voice-based dialogue."
Poster,A Functional Extension of Semi-Structured Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94838,"David Rügamer, Bernard Liew, Zainab Altai, Almond Stöcker","Semi-structured networks (SSNs) merge the structures familiar from additive models with deep neural networks, allowing the modeling of interpretable partial feature effects while capturing higher-order non-linearities at the same time. A significant challenge in this integration is maintaining the interpretability of the additive model component. Inspired by large-scale biomechanics datasets, this paper explores extending SSNs to functional data. Existing methods in functional data analysis are promising but often not expressive enough to account for all interactions and non-linearities and do not scale well to large datasets. Although the SSN approach presents a compelling potential solution, its adaptation to functional data remains complex. In this work, we propose a functional SSN method that retains the advantageous properties of classical functional regression approaches while also improving scalability. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach accurately recovers underlying signals, enhances predictive performance, and performs favorably compared to competing methods."
Poster,A generalized neural tangent kernel for surrogate gradient learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93872,"Luke Eilers, Raoul-Martin Memmesheimer, Sven Goedeke","State-of-the-art neural network training methods depend on the gradient of the network function. Therefore, they cannot be applied to networks whose activation functions do not have useful derivatives, such as binary and discrete-time spiking neural networks. To overcome this problem, the activation function's derivative is commonly substituted with a surrogate derivative, giving rise to surrogate gradient learning (SGL). This method works well in practice but lacks theoretical foundation.The neural tangent kernel (NTK) has proven successful in the analysis of gradient descent. Here, we provide a generalization of the NTK, which we call the surrogate gradient NTK, that enables the analysis of SGL. First, we study a naive extension of the NTK to activation functions with jumps, demonstrating that gradient descent for such activation functions is also ill-posed in the infinite-width limit. To address this problem, we generalize the NTK to gradient descent with surrogate derivatives, i.e., SGL. We carefully define this generalization and expand the existing key theorems on the NTK with mathematical rigor. Further, we illustrate our findings with numerical experiments. Finally, we numerically compare SGL in networks with sign activation function and finite width to kernel regression with the surrogate gradient NTK; the results confirm that the surrogate gradient NTK provides a good characterization of SGL."
Poster,A General Protocol to Probe Large Vision Models for 3D Physical Understanding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96940,"Guanqi Zhan, Chuanxia Zheng, Weidi Xie, Andrew Zisserman","Our objective in this paper is to probe large vision models to determine to what extent they ‘understand’ different physical properties of the 3D scene depicted in an image. To this end, we make the following contributions: (i) We introduce a general and lightweight protocol to evaluate whether features of an off-the-shelf large vision model encode a number of physical ‘properties’ of the 3D scene, by training discriminative classifiers on the features for these properties. The probes are applied on datasets of real images with annotations for the property. (ii) We apply this protocol to properties covering scene geometry, scene material, support relations, lighting, and view-dependent measures, and large vision models including CLIP, DINOv1, DINOv2, VQGAN, Stable Diffusion. (iii) We find that features from Stable Diffusion and DINOv2 are good for discriminative learning of a number of properties, including scene geometry, support relations, shadows and depth, but less performant for occlusion and material, while outperforming DINOv1, CLIP and VQGAN for all properties. (iv) It is observed that different time steps of Stable Diffusion features, as well as different transformer layers of DINO/CLIP/VQGAN, are good at different properties, unlocking potential applications of 3D physical understanding."
Poster,A Generative Model of Symmetry Transformations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94571,"James Allingham, Bruno Mlodozeniec, Shreyas Padhy, Javier Antorán, David Krueger, Richard Turner, Eric Nalisnick, José Miguel Hernández-Lobato","Correctly capturing the symmetry transformations of data can lead to efficient models with strong generalization capabilities, though methods incorporating symmetries often require prior knowledge.While recent advancements have been made in learning those symmetries directly from the dataset, most of this work has focused on the discriminative setting.In this paper, we take inspiration from group theoretic ideas to construct a generative model that explicitly aims to capture the data's approximate symmetries. This results in a model that, given a prespecified broad set of possible symmetries, learns to what extent, if at all, those symmetries are actually present.Our model can be seen as a generative process for data augmentation.We provide a simple algorithm for learning our generative model and empirically demonstrate its ability to capture symmetries under affine and color transformations, in an interpretable way.Combining our symmetry model with standard generative models results in higher marginal test-log-likelihoods and improved data efficiency."
Poster,AgentBoard: An Analytical Evaluation Board of Multi-turn LLM Agents,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97853,"Ma Chang, Junlei Zhang, Zhihao Zhu, Cheng Yang, Yujiu Yang, Yaohui Jin, Zhenzhong Lan, Lingpeng Kong, Junxian He","Evaluating large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose agents is essential for understanding their capabilities and facilitating their integration into practical applications. However, the evaluation process presents substantial challenges. A primary obstacle is the benchmarking of agent performance across diverse scenarios within a unified framework, especially in maintaining partially-observable environments and ensuring multi-round interactions. Moreover, current evaluation frameworks mostly focus on the final success rate, revealing few insights during the process and failing to provide a deep understanding of the model abilities. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentBoard, a pioneering comprehensive benchmark and accompanied open-source evaluation framework tailored to analytical evaluation of LLM agents. AgentBoard offers a fine-grained progress rate metric that captures incremental advancements as well as a comprehensive evaluation toolkit that features easy assessment of agents for multi-faceted analysis through interactive visualization. This not only sheds light on the capabilities and limitations of LLM agents but also propels the interpretability of their performance to the forefront. Ultimately, AgentBoard serves as a significant step towards demystifying agent behaviors and accelerating the development of stronger LLM agents."
Poster,AgentDojo: A Dynamic Environment to Evaluate Prompt Injection Attacks and Defenses for LLM Agents,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97522,"Edoardo Debenedetti, Jie Zhang, Mislav Balunovic, Luca Beurer-Kellner, Marc Fischer, Florian Tramer","AI agents aim to solve complex tasks by combining text-based reasoning with external tool calls.Unfortunately, AI agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks where data returned by external tools hijacks the agent to execute malicious tasks.To measure the adversarial robustness of AI agents, we introduce AgentDojo, an evaluation framework for agents that execute tools over untrusted data.To capture the evolving nature of attacks and defenses, AgentDojo is not a static test suite, but rather an extensible environment for designing and evaluating new agent tasks, defenses, and adaptive attacks.We populate the environment with 97 realistic tasks (e.g., managing an email client, navigating an e-banking website, or making travel bookings), 629 security test cases, and various attack and defense paradigms from the literature.We find that AgentDojo poses a challenge for both attacks and defenses: state-of-the-art LLMs fail at many tasks (even in the absence of attacks), and existing prompt injection attacks break some security properties but not all. We hope that AgentDojo can foster research on new design principles for AI agents that solve common tasks in a reliable and robust manner."
