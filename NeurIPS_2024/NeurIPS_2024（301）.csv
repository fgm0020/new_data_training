Poster,Outlier-Robust Distributionally Robust Optimization via Unbalanced Optimal Transport,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94920,"Zifan Wang, Yi Shen, Michael Zavlanos, Karl H. Johansson","Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) accounts for uncertainty in data distributions by optimizing the model performance against the worst possible distribution within an ambiguity set. In this paper, we propose a DRO framework that relies on a new distance inspired by Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT). The proposed UOT distance employs a soft penalization term instead of hard constraints, enabling the construction of an ambiguity set that is more resilient to outliers.  Under smoothness conditions, we establish strong duality of the proposed DRO problem. Moreover, we introduce a computationally efficient Lagrangian penalty formulation for which we show that strong duality also holds. Finally, we provide empirical results that demonstrate that our method offers improved robustness to outliers and is computationally less demanding for regression and classification tasks."
Poster,Out-of-Distribution Detection with a Single Unconditional Diffusion Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93332,"Alvin Heng, alexandre thiery, Harold Soh","Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical task in machine learning that seeks to identify abnormal samples. Traditionally, unsupervised methods utilize a deep generative model for OOD detection. However, such approaches require a new model to be trained for each inlier dataset. This paper explores whether a single model can  perform OOD detection across diverse tasks. To that end, we introduce  Diffusion Paths (DiffPath), which  uses a single diffusion model originally trained to perform unconditional generation for OOD detection. We introduce a novel technique of measuring the rate-of-change and curvature of the diffusion paths connecting samples to the standard normal. Extensive experiments show that with a single model, DiffPath is competitive with prior work using individual models on a variety of OOD tasks involving different distributions. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/clear-nus/diffpath."
Poster,Out-Of-Distribution Detection with Diversification (Provably),https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96168,"Haiyun Yao, Zongbo Han, Huazhu Fu, Xi Peng, Qinghua Hu, Changqing Zhang","Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for ensuring reliable deployment of machine learning models. Recent advancements focus on utilizing easily accessible auxiliary outliers (e.g., data from the web or other datasets) in training. However, we experimentally reveal that these methods still struggle to generalize their detection capabilities to unknown OOD data, due to the limited diversity of the auxiliary outliers collected. Therefore, we thoroughly examine this problem from the generalization perspective and demonstrate that a more diverse set of auxiliary outliers is essential for enhancing the detection capabilities. However, in practice, it is difficult and costly to collect sufficiently diverse auxiliary outlier data. Therefore, we propose a simple yet practical approach with a theoretical guarantee, termed Diversity-induced Mixup for OOD detection (diverseMix), which enhances the diversity of auxiliary outlier set for training in an efficient way. Extensive experiments show that diverseMix achieves superior performance on commonly used and recent challenging large-scale benchmarks, which further confirm the importance of the diversity of auxiliary outliers."
Poster,Overcoming Brittleness in Pareto-Optimal Learning Augmented Algorithms,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94241,"Alex Elenter, Spyros Angelopoulos, Christoph Dürr, Yanni LEFKI","The study of online algorithms with machine-learned predictions has gained considerable prominence in recent years. One of the common objectives in the design and analysis of such algorithms is to attain (Pareto) optimal tradeoffs between the {\em consistency} of the algorithm, i.e., its performance assuming perfect predictions, and its {\em robustness}, i.e., the performance of the algorithm under adversarial predictions. In this work, we demonstrate that this optimization criterion can be extremely brittle, in that the performance of Pareto-optimal algorithms may degrade dramatically even in the presence of imperceptive prediction error. To remedy this drawback, we propose a new framework in which the smoothness in the performance of the algorithm is enforced by means of a {\em user-specified profile}. This allows us to regulate the performance of the algorithm as a function of the prediction error, while simultaneouslymaintaining the analytical notion of consistency/robustness tradeoffs, adapted to the profile setting. We apply this new approach to a well-studied online problem, namely the {\em one-way trading} problem. For this problem, we further address another limitation of the state-of-the-art Pareto-optimal algorithms, namely the fact that they are tailored to worst-case, and extremely pessimistic inputs. We propose a new Pareto-optimal algorithm that leverages any deviation from the worst-case input to its benefit, and introduce a new metric that allows us to compare any two Pareto-optimal algorithms via a {\em dominance} relation."
Poster,Overcoming Common Flaws in the Evaluation of Selective Classification Systems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96815,"Jeremias Traub, Till Bungert, Carsten Lüth, Michael Baumgartner, Klaus Maier-Hein, Lena Maier-Hein, Paul Jaeger","Selective Classification, wherein models can reject low-confidence predictions, promises reliable translation of machine-learning based classification systems to real-world scenarios such as clinical diagnostics. While current evaluation of these systems typically assumes fixed working points based on pre-defined rejection thresholds, methodological progress requires benchmarking the general performance of systems akin to the $\mathrm{AUROC}$ in standard classification. In this work, we define 5 requirements for multi-threshold metrics in selective classification regarding task alignment, interpretability, and flexibility, and show how current approaches fail to meet them. We propose the Area under the Generalized Risk Coverage curve ($\mathrm{AUGRC}$), which meets all requirements and can be directly interpreted as the average risk of undetected failures. We empirically demonstrate the relevance of $\mathrm{AUGRC}$ on a comprehensive benchmark spanning 6 data sets and 13 confidence scoring functions. We find that the proposed metric substantially changes metric rankings on 5 out of the 6 data sets."
Poster,Overcoming the Sim-to-Real Gap: Leveraging Simulation to Learn to Explore for Real-World RL,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95701,"Andrew Wagenmaker, Kevin Huang, Liyiming Ke, Kevin Jamieson, Abhishek Gupta","In order to mitigate the sample complexity of real-world reinforcement learning, common practice is to first train a policy in a simulator where samples are cheap, and then deploy this policy in the real world, with the hope that it generalizes effectively. Such \emph{direct sim2real} transfer is not guaranteed to succeed, however, and in cases where it fails, it is unclear how to best utilize the simulator. In this work, we show that in many regimes, while direct sim2real transfer may fail, we can utilize the simulator to learn a set of \emph{exploratory} policies which enable efficient exploration in the real world. In particular, in the setting of low-rank MDPs, we show that coupling these exploratory policies with simple, practical approaches---least-squares regression oracles and naive randomized exploration---yields a polynomial sample complexity in the real world, an exponential improvement over direct sim2real transfer, or learning without access to a simulator. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence that simulation transfer yields a provable gain in reinforcement learning in settings where direct sim2real transfer fails. We validate our theoretical results on several realistic robotic simulators and a real-world robotic sim2real task, demonstrating that transferring exploratory policies can yield substantial gains in practice as well."
Poster,Overfitting Behaviour of Gaussian Kernel Ridgeless Regression: Varying Bandwidth or Dimensionality,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96451,"Marko Medvedev, Gal Vardi, Nati Srebro","We consider the overfitting behavior of minimum norm interpolating solutions of Gaussian kernel ridge regression (i.e. kernel ridgeless regression), when the bandwidth or input dimension varies with the sample size. For fixed dimensions, we show that even with varying or tuned bandwidth, the ridgeless solution is never consistent and, at least with large enough noise, always worse than the null predictor. For increasing dimension, we give a generic characterization of the overfitting behavior for any scaling of the dimension with sample size. We use this to provide the first example of benign overfitting using the Gaussian kernel with sub-polynomial scaling dimension.  All our results are under the Gaussian universality ansatz and the (non-rigorous) risk predictions in terms of the kernel eigenstructure."
Poster,Over-parameterized Student Model via Tensor Decomposition Boosted Knowledge Distillation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94206,"Yu-Liang Zhan, Zhong-Yi Lu, Hao Sun, Ze-Feng Gao","Increased training parameters have enabled large pre-trained models to excel in various downstream tasks. Nevertheless, the extensive computational requirements associated with these models hinder their widespread adoption within the community. We focus on Knowledge Distillation (KD), where a compact student model is trained to mimic a larger teacher model, facilitating the transfer of knowledge of large models. In contrast to much of the previous work, we scale up the parameters of the student model during training, to benefit from over-parameterization without increasing the inference latency. In particular, we propose a tensor decomposition strategy that effectively over-parameterizes the relatively small student model through an efficient and nearly lossless decomposition of its parameter matrices into higher-dimensional tensors. To ensure efficiency, we further introduce a tensor constraint loss to align the high-dimensional tensors between the student and teacher models. Comprehensive experiments validate the significant performance enhancement by our approach in various KD tasks, covering computer vision and natural language processing areas.

Poster,OVT-B: A New Large-Scale Benchmark for Open-Vocabulary Multi-Object Tracking,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97847,"Haiji Liang, Ruize Han","Open-vocabulary object perception has become an important topic in artificial intelligence, which aims to identify objects with novel classes that have not been seen during training. Under this setting, open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) in a single image has been studied in many literature. However, open-vocabulary object tracking (OVT) from a video has been studied less, and one reason is the shortage of benchmarks. In this work, we have built a new large-scale benchmark for open-vocabulary multi-object tracking namely OVT-B. OVT-B contains 1,048 categories of objects and 1,973 videos with 637,608 bounding box annotations, which is much larger than the sole open-vocabulary tracking dataset, i.e., OVTAO-val dataset (200+ categories, 900+ videos). The proposed OVT-B can be used as a new benchmark to pave the way for OVT research. We also develop a simple yet effective baseline method for OVT. It integrates the motion features for object tracking, which is an important feature for MOT but is ignored in previous OVT methods. Experimental results have verified the usefulness of the proposed benchmark and the effectiveness of our method. We have released the benchmark to the public at https://github.com/Coo1Sea/OVT-B-Dataset."
Poster,OwMatch: Conditional Self-Labeling with Consistency for Open-World Semi-Supervised Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93416,"Shengjie Niu, Lifan Lin, Jian Huang, Chao Wang","Semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a robust framework for harnessing the potential of unannotated data. Traditionally, SSL mandates that all classes possess labeled instances. However, the emergence of open-world SSL (OwSSL) introduces a more practical challenge, wherein unlabeled data may encompass samples from unseen classes. This scenario leads to misclassification of unseen classes as known ones, consequently undermining classification accuracy. To overcome this challenge, this study revisits two methodologies from self-supervised and semi-supervised learning, self-labeling and consistency, tailoring them to address the OwSSL problem. Specifically, we propose an effective framework called _OwMatch_, combining conditional self-labeling and open-world hierarchical thresholding.  Theoretically, we analyze the estimation of class distribution on unlabeled data through rigorous statistical analysis, thus demonstrating that OwMatch can ensure the unbiasedness of the label assignment estimator with reliability.  Comprehensive empirical analyses demonstrate that our method yields substantial performance enhancements across both known and unknown classes in comparison to previous studies.
