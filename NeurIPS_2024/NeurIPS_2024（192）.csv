Poster,Identifying Causal Effects Under Functional Dependencies,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95380,"Yizuo Chen, Adnan Darwiche","We study the identification of causal effects, motivated by two improvements to identifiability which can be attained if one knows that some variables in a causal graph are functionally determined by their parents (without needing to know the specific functions). First, an unidentifiable causal effect may become identifiable when certain variables are functional. Second, certain functional variables can be excluded from being observed without affecting the identifiability of a causal effect, which may significantly reduce the number of needed variables in observational data. Our results are largely based on an elimination procedure which removes functional variables from a causal graph while preserving key properties in the resulting causal graph, including the identifiability of causal effects."
Poster,Identifying Equivalent Training Dynamics,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94485,"William Redman, Juan M. Bello-Rivas, Maria Fonoberova, Ryan Mohr, Yannis Kevrekidis, Igor Mezic","Study of the nonlinear evolution deep neural network (DNN) parameters undergo during training has uncovered regimes of distinct dynamical behavior. While a detailed understanding of these phenomena has the potential to advance improvements in training efficiency and robustness, the lack of methods for identifying when DNN models have equivalent dynamics limits the insight that can be gained from prior work. Topological conjugacy, a notion from dynamical systems theory, provides a precise definition of dynamical equivalence, offering a possible route to address this need. However, topological conjugacies have historically been challenging to compute. By leveraging advances in Koopman operator theory, we develop a framework for identifying conjugate and non-conjugate training dynamics. To validate our approach, we demonstrate that comparing Koopman eigenvalues can correctly identify a known equivalence between online mirror descent and online gradient descent. We then utilize our approach to: (a) identify non-conjugate training dynamics between shallow and wide fully connected neural networks; (b) characterize the early phase of training dynamics in convolutional neural networks; (c) uncover non-conjugate training dynamics in Transformers that do and do not undergo grokking. Our results, across a range of DNN architectures, illustrate the flexibility of our framework and highlight its potential for shedding new light on training dynamics."
Poster,Identifying Functionally Important Features with End-to-End Sparse Dictionary Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96413,"Dan Braun, Jordan Taylor, Nicholas Goldowsky-Dill, Lee Sharkey","Identifying the features learned by neural networks is a core challenge in mechanistic interpretability. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs), which learn a sparse, overcomplete dictionary that reconstructs a network's internal activations, have been used to identify these features. However, SAEs may learn more about the structure of the datatset than the computational structure of the network. There is therefore only indirect reason to believe that the directions found in these dictionaries are functionally important to the network. We propose end-to-end (e2e) sparse dictionary learning, a method for training SAEs that ensures the features learned are functionally important by minimizing the KL divergence between the output distributions of the original model and the model with SAE activations inserted. Compared to standard SAEs, e2e SAEs offer a Pareto improvement: They explain more network performance, require fewer total features, and require fewer simultaneously active features per datapoint, all with no cost to interpretability. We explore geometric and qualitative differences between e2e SAE features and standard SAE features. E2e dictionary learning brings us closer to methods that can explain network behavior concisely and accurately. We release our library for training e2e SAEs and reproducing our analysis athttps://github.com/ApolloResearch/e2e_sae."
Poster,Identifying General Mechanism Shifts in Linear Causal Representations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93955,"Tianyu Chen, Kevin Bello, Francesco Locatello, Bryon Aragam, Pradeep Ravikumar","We consider the linear causal representation learning setting where we observe a linear mixing of $d$ unknown latent factors, which follow a linear structural causal model. Recent work has shown that it is possible to recover the latent factors as well as the underlying structural causal model over them, up to permutation and scaling, provided that we have at least $d$ environments, each of which corresponds to perfect interventions on a single latent node (factor). After this powerful result, a key open problem faced by the community has been to relax these conditions: allow for coarser than perfect single-node interventions, and allow for fewer than $d$ of them, since the number of latent factors $d$ could be very large. In this work, we consider precisely such a setting, where we allow a smaller than $d$ number of environments, and also allow for very coarse interventions that can very coarsely \textit{change the entire causal graph over the latent factors}. On the flip side, we relax what we wish to extract to simply the \textit{list of nodes that have shifted between one or more environments}. We provide a surprising identifiability result that it is indeed possible, under some very mild standard assumptions, to identify the set of shifted nodes. Our identifiability proof moreover is a constructive one: we explicitly provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a node to be a shifted node, and show that we can check these conditions given observed data. Our algorithm lends itself very naturally to the sample setting where instead of just interventional distributions, we are provided datasets of samples from each of these distributions. We corroborate our results on both synthetic experiments as well as an interesting psychometric dataset. The code can be found at https://github.com/TianyuCodings/iLCS."
Poster,Identifying Latent State-Transition Processes for Individualized Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93892,"Yuewen Sun, Biwei Huang, Yu Yao, Donghuo Zeng, Xinshuai Dong, Songyao Jin, Boyang Sun, Roberto Legaspi, Kazushi Ikeda, Peter Spirtes, Kun Zhang","The application of reinforcement learning (RL) involving interactions with individuals has grown significantly in recent years. These interactions, influenced by factors such as personal preferences and physiological differences, causally influence state transitions, ranging from health conditions in healthcare to learning progress in education. As a result, different individuals may exhibit different state-transition processes. Understanding individualized state-transition processes is essential for optimizing individualized policies. In practice, however, identifying these state-transition processes is challenging, as individual-specific factors often remain latent. In this paper, we establish the identifiability of these latent factors and introduce a practical method that effectively learns these processes from observed state-action trajectories. Experiments on various datasets show that the proposed method can effectively identify latent state-transition processes and facilitate the learning of individualized RL policies."
Poster,Identifying Selections for Unsupervised Subtask Discovery,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94080,"Yiwen Qiu, Yujia Zheng, Kun Zhang","When solving long-horizon tasks, it is intriguing to decompose the high-level task into subtasks. Decomposing experiences into reusable subtasks can improve data efficiency, accelerate policy generalization, and in general provide promising solutions to multi-task reinforcement learning and imitation learning problems. However, the concept of subtasks is not sufficiently understood and modeled yet, and existing works often overlook the true structure of the data generation process: subtasks are the results of a *selection* mechanism on actions, rather than possible underlying confounders or intermediates. Specifically, we provide a theory to identify, and experiments to verify the existence of selection variables in such data. These selections serve as subgoals that indicate subtasks and guide policy. In light of this idea, we develop a sequential non-negative matrix factorization (seq- NMF) method to learn these subgoals and extract meaningful behavior patterns as subtasks. Our empirical results on a challenging Kitchen environment demonstrate that the learned subtasks effectively enhance the generalization to new tasks in multi-task imitation learning scenarios.

Poster,Identifying Spatio-Temporal Drivers of Extreme Events,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96083,"Mohamad Hakam Shams Eddin, Jürgen Gall","The spatio-temporal relations of impacts of extreme events and their drivers in climate data are not fully understood and there is a need of machine learning approaches to identify such spatio-temporal relations from data. The task, however, is very challenging since there are time delays between extremes and their drivers, and the spatial response of such drivers is inhomogeneous. In this work, we propose a first approach and benchmarks to tackle this challenge. Our approach is trained end-to-end to predict spatio-temporally extremes and spatio-temporally drivers in the physical input variables jointly. By enforcing the network to predict extremes from spatio-temporal binary masks of identified drivers, the network successfully identifies drivers that are correlated with extremes. We evaluate our approach on three newly created synthetic benchmarks, where two of them are based on remote sensing or reanalysis climate data, and on two real-world reanalysis datasets. The source code and datasets are publicly available at the project page https://hakamshams.github.io/IDE."
Poster,Identify Then Recommend: Towards Unsupervised Group Recommendation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93624,"Yue Liu, Shihao Zhu, Tianyuan Yang, Jian Ma, Wenliang Zhong","Group Recommendation (GR), which aims to recommend items to groups of users, has become a promising and practical direction for recommendation systems. This paper points out two issues of the state-of-the-art GR models. (1) The pre-defined and fixed number of user groups is inadequate for real-time industrial recommendation systems, where the group distribution can shift dynamically. (2) The training schema of existing GR methods is supervised, necessitating expensive user-group and group-item labels, leading to significant annotation costs. To this end, we present a novel unsupervised group recommendation framework named $\underline{\text{I}}$dentify $\underline{\text{T}}$hen $\underline{\text{R}}$ecommend ($\underline{\text{ITR}}$), where it first identifies the user groups in an unsupervised manner even without the pre-defined number of groups, and then two pre-text tasks are designed to conduct self-supervised group recommendation. Concretely, at the group identification stage, we first estimate the adaptive density of each user point, where areas with higher densities are more likely to be recognized as group centers. Then, a heuristic merge-and-split strategy is designed to discover the user groups and decision boundaries. Subsequently, at the self-supervised learning stage, the pull-and-repulsion pre-text task is proposed to optimize the user-group distribution. Besides, the pseudo group recommendation pre-text task is designed to assist the recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of ITR on both user recommendation (e.g., 22.22\% NDCG@5 $\uparrow$) and group recommendation (e.g., 22.95\% NDCG@5 $\uparrow$). Furthermore, we deploy ITR on the industrial recommender and achieve promising results."
Poster,Identity Decoupling for Multi-Subject Personalization of Text-to-Image Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93349,"Sangwon Jang, Jaehyeong Jo, Kimin Lee, Sung Ju Hwang","Text-to-image diffusion models have shown remarkable success in generating personalized subjects based on a few reference images. However, current methods often fail when generating multiple subjects simultaneously, resulting in mixedidentities with combined attributes from different subjects. In this work, we present MuDI, a novel framework that enables multi-subject personalization by effectively decoupling identities from multiple subjects. Our main idea is to utilize segmented subjects generated by a foundation model for segmentation (Segment Anything) for both training and inference, as a form of data augmentation for training and initialization for the generation process. Moreover, we further introduce a new metric to better evaluate the performance of our method on multi-subject personalization. Experimental results show that our MuDI can produce high-quality personalized images without identity mixing, even for highly similar subjects as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, in human evaluation, MuDI obtains twice the success rate for personalizing multiple subjects without identity mixing over existing baselines and is preferred over 70% against the strongest baseline."
Poster,IDGen: Item Discrimination Induced Prompt Generation for LLM Evaluation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92927,"Fan Lin, Shuyi Xie, Yong Dai, Wenlin Yao, TianJiao Lang, Yu Zhang","As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more capable of handling increasingly complex tasks, the evaluation set must keep pace with these advancements to ensure it remains sufficiently discriminative. Item Discrimination (ID) theory, which is widely used in educational assessment, measures the ability of individual test items to differentiate between high and low performers. Inspired by this theory, we propose an ID-induced prompt synthesis framework for evaluating LLMs so that the evaluation set continually updates and refines according to model abilities. Our data synthesis framework prioritizes both breadth and specificity. It can generate prompts that comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs while revealing meaningful performance differences between models, allowing for effective discrimination of their relative strengths and weaknesses across various tasks and domains.To produce high-quality data, we incorporate a self-correct mechanism into our generalization framework and develop two models to predict prompt discrimination and difficulty score to facilitate our data synthesis framework, contributing valuable tools to evaluation data synthesis research. We apply our generated data to evaluate five SOTA models. Our data achieves an average score of 51.92, accompanied by a variance of 10.06. By contrast, previous works (i.e., SELF-INSTRUCT and WizardLM) obtain an average score exceeding 67, with a variance below 3.2.The results demonstrate that the data generated by our framework is more challenging and discriminative compared to previous works.We will release a dataset of over 3,000 carefully crafted prompts to facilitate evaluation research of LLMs."
