Poster,Ultrafast classical phylogenetic method beats large protein language models on variant effect prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95854,"Sebastian Prillo, Wilson Wu, Yun Song","Amino acid substitution rate matrices are fundamental to statistical phylogenetics and evolutionary biology. Estimating them typically requires reconstructed trees for massive amounts of aligned proteins, which poses a major computational bottleneck. In this paper, we develop a near-linear time method to estimate these rate matrices from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) alone, thereby speeding up computation by orders of magnitude. Our method relies on a near-linear time cherry reconstruction algorithm which we call FastCherries and it can be easily applied to MSAs with millions of sequences. On both simulated and real data, we demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our method as applied to the classical model of protein evolution. By leveraging the unprecedented scalability of our method, we develop a new, rich phylogenetic model called SiteRM, which can estimate a general site-specific rate matrix for each column of an MSA. Remarkably, in variant effect prediction for both clinical and deep mutational scanning data in ProteinGym, we show that despite being an independent-sites model, our SiteRM model outperforms large protein language models that learn complex residue-residue interactions between different sites. We attribute our increased performance to conceptual advances in our probabilistic treatment of evolutionary data and our ability to handle extremely large MSAs. We anticipate that our work will have a lasting impact across both statistical phylogenetics and computational variant effect prediction. FastCherries and SiteRM are implemented in the CherryML package https://github.com/songlab-cal/CherryML."
Poster,UltraMedical: Building Specialized Generalists in Biomedicine,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97506,"Kaiyan Zhang, Sihang Zeng, Ermo Hua, Ning Ding, Zhang-Ren Chen, Zhiyuan Ma, Haoxin Li, Ganqu Cui, Biqing Qi, Xuekai Zhu, Xingtai Lv, Hu Jinfang, Zhiyuan Liu, Bowen Zhou","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains and are moving towards more specialized areas. Recent advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4 and Gemini have achieved significant advancements in biomedicine, which have also raised privacy and security challenges. The construction of specialized generalists hinges largely on high-quality datasets, enhanced by techniques like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human or AI feedback, and direct preference optimization. However, these leading technologies (e.g., preference learning) are still significantly limited in the open source community due to the scarcity of specialized data. In this paper, we present the UltraMedical collections, which consist of high-quality manual and synthetic datasets in the biomedicine domain, featuring preference annotations across multiple advanced LLMs. By utilizing these datasets, we fine-tune a suite of specialized medical models based on Llama-3 series, demonstrating breathtaking capabilities across various medical benchmarks. Moreover, we develop powerful reward models skilled in biomedical and general reward benchmark, enhancing further online preference learning within the biomedical LLM community."
Poster,UltraPixel: Advancing Ultra High-Resolution Image Synthesis to New Peaks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93188,"Jingjing Ren, Wenbo Li, Haoyu Chen, Renjing Pei, Bin Shao, Yong Guo, Long Peng, Fenglong Song, Lei Zhu","Ultra-high-resolution image generation poses great challenges, such as increased semantic planning complexity and detail synthesis difficulties, alongside substantial training resource demands. We present UltraPixel, a novel architecture utilizing cascade diffusion models to generate high-quality images at multiple resolutions (\textit{e.g.}, 1K, 2K, and 4K) within a single model, while maintaining computational efficiency. UltraPixel leverages semantics-rich representations of lower-resolution images in a later denoising stage to guide the whole generation of highly detailed high-resolution images, significantly reducing complexity. Specifically, we introduce implicit neural representations for continuous upsampling and scale-aware normalization layers adaptable to various resolutions. Notably, both low- and high-resolution processes are performed in the most compact space, sharing the majority of parameters with less than 3$\%$ additional parameters for high-resolution outputs, largely enhancing training and inference efficiency. Our model achieves fast training with reduced data requirements, producing photo-realistic high-resolution images and demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in extensive experiments."
Poster,UMB: Understanding Model Behavior for Open-World Object Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96312,"Xing Xi, Yangyang Huang, Zhijie Zhong, Ronghua Luo","Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) is a challenging task that requires the detector to identify unlabeled objects and continuously demands the detector to learn new knowledge based on existing ones. Existing methods primarily focus on recalling unknown objects, neglecting to explore the reasons behind them. This paper aims to understand the model's behavior in predicting the unknown category. First, we model the text attribute and the positive sample probability, obtaining their empirical probability, which can be seen as the detector's estimation of the likelihood of the target with certain known attributes being predicted as the foreground. Then, we jointly decide whether the current object should be categorized in the unknown category based on the empirical, the in-distribution, and the out-of-distribution probability. Finally, based on the decision-making process, we can infer the similarity of an unknown object to known classes and identify the attribute with the most significant impact on the decision-making process. This additional information can help us understand the behavior of the model's prediction in the unknown class. The evaluation results on the Real-World Object Detection (RWD) benchmark, which consists of five real-world application datasets, show that we surpassed the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) with an absolute gain of 5.3 mAP for unknown classes, reaching 20.5 mAP.

Poster,UMFC: Unsupervised Multi-Domain Feature Calibration for Vision-Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94349,"Jiachen Liang, RuiBing Hou, Minyang Hu, Hong Chang, Shiguang Shan, Xilin Chen","Pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have shown powerful zero-shot transfer capabilities. But they still struggle with domain shifts and typically require labeled data to adapt to downstream tasks, which could be costly. In this work, we aim to  leverage unlabeled data that naturally spans multiple domains to enhance the transferability of vision-language models.  Under this unsupervised multi-domain setting, we have identified inherent model bias within CLIP, notably  in its visual and text encoders. Specifically, we observe that CLIP’s visual encoder tends to prioritize  encoding domain over discriminative category information, meanwhile its text encoder exhibits a preference for domain-relevant classes. To mitigate this model bias, we propose a training-free and label-free feature calibration method, Unsupervised Multi-domain Feature Calibration (UMFC). UMFC estimates image-level biases from domain-specific features and text-level biases from the direction of domain transition. These biases are subsequently   subtracted from original image and text features separately, to render them domain-invariant. We evaluate our method on multiple settings including transductive learning and test-time adaptation. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms CLIP and performs on par with the state-of-the-arts that need additional annotations or optimization.Our code is available at https://github.com/GIT-LJc/UMFC."
Poster,Uncertainty-aware Fine-tuning of Segmentation Foundation Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93500,"Kangning Liu, Brian Price, Jason Kuen, Yifei Fan, Zijun Wei, Luis Figueroa, Krzysztof Geras, Carlos Fernandez-Granda","The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a large-scale foundation model that has revolutionized segmentation methodology. Despite its impressive generalization ability, the segmentation accuracy of SAM on images with intricate structures is often unsatisfactory. Recent works have proposed lightweight fine-tuning using high-quality annotated data to improve accuracy on such images. However, here we provide extensive empirical evidence that this strategy leads to forgetting how to ""segment anything"": these models lose the original generalization abilities of SAM, in the sense that they perform worse for segmentation tasks not represented in the annotated fine-tuning set. To improve performance without forgetting, we introduce a novel framework that combines high-quality annotated data with a large unlabeled dataset. The framework relies on two methodological innovations. First, we quantify the uncertainty in the SAM pseudo labels associated with the unlabeled data and leverage it to perform uncertainty-aware fine-tuning. Second, we encode the type of segmentation task associated with each training example using a $\textit{task prompt}$ to reduce ambiguity. We evaluated the proposed Segmentation with Uncertainty Model (SUM) on a diverse test set consisting of 14 public benchmarks, where it achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, our method consistently surpasses SAM by 3-6 points in mean IoU and 4-7 in mean boundary IoU across point-prompt interactive segmentation rounds.

Poster,Uncertainty-based Offline Variational Bayesian Reinforcement Learning for Robustness under Diverse Data Corruptions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93435,"Rui Yang, Jie Wang, Guoping Wu, Bin Li","Real-world offline datasets are often subject to data corruptions (such as noise or adversarial attacks) due to sensor failures or malicious attacks. Despite advances in robust offline reinforcement learning (RL), existing methods struggle to learn robust agents under high uncertainty caused by the diverse corrupted data (i.e., corrupted states, actions, rewards, and dynamics), leading to performance degradation in clean environments. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel robust variational Bayesian inference for offline RL (TRACER). It introduces Bayesian inference for the first time to capture the uncertainty via offline data for robustness against all types of data corruptions. Specifically, TRACER first models all corruptions as the uncertainty in the action-value function. Then, to capture such uncertainty, it uses all offline data as the observations to approximate the posterior distribution of the action-value function under a Bayesian inference framework. An appealing feature of TRACER is that it can distinguish corrupted data from clean data using an entropy-based uncertainty measure, since corrupted data often induces higher uncertainty and entropy. Based on the aforementioned measure, TRACER can regulate the loss associated with corrupted data to reduce its influence, thereby enhancing robustness and performance in clean environments. Experiments demonstrate that TRACER significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches across both individual and simultaneous data corruptions."
Poster,Uncertainty of Thoughts: Uncertainty-Aware Planning Enhances Information Seeking in LLMs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96142,"Zhiyuan Hu, Chumin Liu, Xidong Feng, Yilun Zhao, See-Kiong Ng, Anh Tuan Luu, Junxian He, Pang Wei Koh, Bryan Hooi","In the face of uncertainty, the ability to *seek information* is of fundamental importance. In many practical applications, such as medical diagnosis and troubleshooting, the information needed to solve the task is not initially given, and has to be actively sought by asking follow-up questions (for example, a doctor asking a patient for more details about their symptoms). In this work, we introduce **Uncertainty of Thoughts (UoT)**, an algorithm to augment large language models with the ability to actively seek information by asking effective questions. UoT combines:1. An *uncertainty-aware simulation approach* which enables the model to simulate possible future scenarios and how likely they are to occur,2. *Uncertainty-based rewards* motivated by information gain which incentivizes the model to seek information, and3. A *reward propagation scheme* to select the optimal question to ask in a way that maximizes the expected reward.In experiments on medical diagnosis, troubleshooting and the `20 Questions' game, UoT achieves an average performance improvement of 38.1% in the rate of successful task completion across multiple LLMs compared with direct prompting, and also improves efficiency (i.e., the number of questions needed to complete the task)."
Poster,Unchosen Experts Can Contribute Too: Unleashing MoE Models’ Power by Self-Contrast,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96169,"Chufan Shi, Cheng Yang, Xinyu Zhu, Jiahao Wang, Taiqiang Wu, Siheng Li, Deng Cai, Yujiu Yang, Yu Meng","Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a prominent architecture for scaling model size while maintaining computational efficiency. In MoE, each token in the input sequence activates a different subset of experts determined by a routing mechanism. However, the unchosen experts in MoE models do not contribute to the output, potentially leading to underutilization of the model's capacity.In this work, we first conduct exploratory studies to demonstrate that increasing the number of activated experts does not necessarily improve and can even degrade the output quality. Then, we show that output distributions from an MoE model using different routing strategies substantially differ, indicating that different experts do not always act synergistically. Motivated by these findings, we propose **S**elf-**C**ontrast **M**ixture-**o**f-**E**xperts (SCMoE), a training-free strategy that utilizes unchosen experts in a self-contrast manner during inference. In SCMoE, the next-token probabilities are determined by contrasting the outputs from strong and weak activation using the same MoE model.Our method is conceptually simple and computationally lightweight, as it incurs minimal latency compared to greedy decoding. Experiments on several benchmarks (GSM8K, StrategyQA, MBPP and HumanEval) demonstrate that SCMoE can consistently enhance Mixtral 8x7B’s reasoning capability across various domains. For example, it improves the accuracy on GSM8K from 61.79 to 66.94. Moreover, combining SCMoE with self-consistency yields additional gains, increasing major@20 accuracy from 75.59 to 78.31."
Poster,Unconditional stability of a recurrent neural circuit implementing divisive normalization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96568,"Shivang Rawat, David Heeger, Stefano Martiniani","Stability in recurrent neural models poses a significant challenge, particularly in developing biologically plausible neurodynamical models that can be seamlessly trained. Traditional cortical circuit models are notoriously difficult to train due to expansive nonlinearities in the dynamical system, leading to an optimization problem with nonlinear stability constraints that are difficult to impose. Conversely, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) excel in tasks involving sequential data but lack biological plausibility and interpretability. In this work, we address these challenges by linking dynamic divisive normalization (DN) to the stability of ""oscillatory recurrent gated neural integrator circuits'' (ORGaNICs), a biologically plausible recurrent cortical circuit model that dynamically achieves DN and that has been shown to simulate a wide range of neurophysiological phenomena. By using the indirect method of Lyapunov, we prove the remarkable property of unconditional local stability for an arbitrary-dimensional ORGaNICs circuit when the recurrent weight matrix is the identity. We thus connect ORGaNICs to a system of coupled damped harmonic oscillators, which enables us to derive the circuit's energy function, providing a normative principle of what the circuit, and individual neurons, aim to accomplish. Further, for a generic recurrent weight matrix, we prove the stability of the 2D model and demonstrate empirically that stability holds in higher dimensions. Finally, we show that ORGaNICs can be trained by backpropagation through time without gradient clipping/scaling, thanks to its intrinsic stability property and adaptive time constants, which address the problems of exploding, vanishing, and oscillating gradients. By evaluating the model's performance on RNN benchmarks, we find that ORGaNICs outperform alternative neurodynamical models on static image classification tasks and perform comparably to LSTMs on sequential tasks."
