Poster,Skill-aware Mutual Information Optimisation for Zero-shot Generalisation in Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95867,"Xuehui Yu, Mhairi Dunion, Xin Li, Stefano Albrecht","Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL) agents can struggle to operate across tasks with varying environmental features that require different optimal skills (i.e., different modes of behaviour). Using context encoders based on contrastive learning to enhance the generalisability of Meta-RL agents is now widely studied but faces challenges such as the requirement for a large sample size, also referred to as the $\log$-$K$ curse. To improve RL generalisation to different tasks, we first introduce Skill-aware Mutual Information (SaMI), an optimisation objective that aids in distinguishing context embeddings according to skills, thereby equipping RL agents with the ability to identify and execute different skills across tasks. We then propose Skill-aware Noise Contrastive Estimation (SaNCE), a $K$-sample estimator used to optimise the SaMI objective. We provide a framework for equipping an RL agent with SaNCE in practice and conduct experimental validation on modified MuJoCo and Panda-gym benchmarks. We empirically find that RL agents that learn by maximising SaMI achieve substantially improved zero-shot generalisation to unseen tasks. Additionally, the context encoder trained with SaNCE demonstrates greater robustness to a reduction in the number of available samples, thus possessing the potential to overcome the $\log$-$K$ curse."
Poster,Skinned Motion Retargeting with Dense Geometric Interaction Perception,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93234,"Zijie Ye, Jia-Wei Liu, Jia Jia, Shikun Sun, Mike Zheng Shou","Capturing and maintaining geometric interactions among different body parts is crucial for successful motion retargeting in skinned characters. Existing approaches often overlook body geometries or add a geometry correction stage after skeletal motion retargeting. This results in conflicts between skeleton interaction and geometry correction, leading to issues such as jittery, interpenetration, and contact mismatches. To address these challenges, we introduce a new retargeting framework, MeshRet, which directly models the dense geometric interactions in motion retargeting. Initially, we establish dense mesh correspondences between characters using semantically consistent sensors (SCS), effective across diverse mesh topologies. Subsequently, we develop a novel spatio-temporal representation called the dense mesh interaction (DMI) field. This field, a collection of interacting SCS feature vectors, skillfully captures both contact and non-contact interactions between body geometries. By aligning the DMI field during retargeting, MeshRet not only preserves motion semantics but also prevents self-interpenetration and ensures contact preservation. Extensive experiments on the public Mixamo dataset and our newly-collected ScanRet dataset demonstrate that MeshRet achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Poster,SkipPredict: When to Invest in Predictions for Scheduling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93885,"Rana Shahout, Michael Mitzenmacher","Expanding on recent work on scheduling with predicted job sizes, we consider the effect of the cost of predictions in queueing systems, removing the assumption in prior research that predictions are external to the system’s resources and/or cost-free. Additionally, we introduce a novel approach to utilizing predictions, SkipPredict, designed to address their inherent cost. Rather than uniformly applying predictions to all jobs, we propose a tailored approach that categorizes jobs to improve the effectiveness of prediction on performance. To achieve this, we employ one-bit “cheap predictions” to classify jobs as either short or long. SkipPredict prioritizes predicted short jobs over long jobs, and for the long jobs, SkipPredict applies a second round of more detailed “expensive predictions” to approximate Shortest Remaining Processing Time for these jobs. Importantly, our analyses take into account the cost of prediction. We derive closed-form formulas that calculate the mean response time of jobs with size predictions accounting for the prediction cost. We examine the effect of this cost for two distinct models in real-world and synthetic datasets. In the external cost model, predictions are generated by external method without impacting job service times but incur a cost. In the server time cost model, predictions themselves require server processing time and are scheduled on the same server as the jobs."
Poster,Slack-Free Spiking Neural Network Formulation for Hypergraph Minimum Vertex Cover,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96690,"Tam Nguyen, Anh-Dzung Doan, zhipeng cai, Tat-Jun Chin","Neuromorphic computers open up the potential of energy-efficient computation using spiking neural networks (SNN), which consist of neurons that exchange spike-based information asynchronously. In particular, SNNs have shown promise in solving combinatorial optimization. Underpinning the SNN methods is the concept of energy minimization of an Ising model, which is closely related to quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). Thus, the starting point for many SNN methods is reformulating the target problem as QUBO, then executing an SNN-based QUBO solver. For many combinatorial problems, the reformulation entails introducing penalty terms, potentially with slack variables, that implement feasibility constraints in the QUBO objective. For more complex problems such as hypergraph minimum vertex cover (HMVC), numerous slack variables are introduced which drastically increase the search domain and reduce the effectiveness of the SNN solver. In this paper, we propose a novel SNN formulation for HMVC. Rather than using penalty terms with slack variables, our SNN architecture introduces additional spiking neurons with a constraint checking and correction mechanism that encourages convergence to feasible solutions. In effect, our method obviates the need for reformulating HMVC as QUBO. Experiments on neuromorphic hardware show that our method consistently yielded high quality solutions for HMVC on real and synthetic instances where the SNN-based QUBO solver often failed, while consuming measurably less energy than global solvers on CPU."
Poster,SLED: Self Logits Evolution Decoding for Improving Factuality in Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93358,"Jianyi Zhang, Da-Cheng Juan, Cyrus Rashtchian, Chun-Sung Ferng, Heinrich Jiang, Yiran Chen","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their outputs can sometimes be unreliable or factually incorrect. To address this, we introduce Self Logits Evolution Decoding (SLED), a novel decoding framework that enhances the truthfulness of LLMs without relying on external knowledge bases or requiring further fine-tuning. From an optimization perspective, our SLED framework leverages the latent knowledge embedded within the LLM by contrasting the output logits from the final layer with those from early layers. It then utilizes an approximate gradient approach to enable latent knowledge to guide the self-refinement of outputs, thereby effectively improving factual accuracy. Extensive experiments have been conducted on established benchmarks across a diverse range of model families (LLaMA 2, LLaMA 3, Gemma) and scales (from 2B to 70B), including more advanced architectural configurations such as the mixture of experts (MoE). Our evaluation spans a wide variety of tasks, including multi-choice, open-generation, and adaptations to chain-of-thought reasoning tasks. The results demonstrate that SLED consistently improves factual accuracy by up to 20\% compared to existing decoding methods while maintaining natural language fluency and negligible latency overhead. Furthermore, it can be flexibly combined with other decoding methods to further enhance their performance."
Poster,SleeperNets: Universal Backdoor Poisoning Attacks Against  Reinforcement Learning Agents,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95806,"Ethan Rathbun, Christopher Amato, Alina Oprea","Reinforcement learning (RL) is an actively growing field that is seeing increased usage in real-world, safety-critical applications -- making it paramount to ensure the robustness of RL algorithms against adversarial attacks. In this work we explore a particularly stealthy form of training-time attacks against RL -- backdoor poisoning. Here the adversary intercepts the training of an RL agent with the goal of reliably inducing a particular action when the agent observes a pre-determined trigger at inference time. We uncover theoretical limitations of prior work by proving their inability to generalize across domains and MDPs. Motivated by this, we formulate a novel poisoning attack framework which interlinks the adversary's objectives with those of finding an optimal policy -- guaranteeing attack success in the limit. Using insights from our theoretical analysis we develop ""SleeperNets"" as a universal backdoor attack which exploits a newly proposed threat model and leverages dynamic reward poisoning techniques. We evaluate our attack in 6 environments spanning multiple domains and demonstrate significant improvements in attack success over existing methods, while preserving benign episodic return."
Poster,Slice-100K: A Multimodal Dataset for Extrusion-based 3D Printing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97577,"Anushrut Nirmal Jignasu, Kelly Marshall, Ankush Kumar Mishra, Lucas Nerone Rillo, Baskar Ganapathysubramanian, Aditya Balu, Chinmay Hegde, Adarsh Krishnamurthy","G-code (Geometric code) or RS-274 is the most widely used computer numerical control (CNC) and 3D printing programming language. G-code provides machine instructions for the movement of the 3D printer, especially for the nozzle, stage, and extrusion of material for extrusion-based additive manufacturing. Currently, there does not exist a large repository of curated CAD models along with their corresponding G-code files for additive manufacturing. To address this issue, we present Slice-100K, a first-of-its-kind dataset of over 100,000 G-code files, along with their tessellated CAD model, LVIS (Large Vocabulary Instance Segmentation) categories, geometric properties, and renderings. We build our dataset from triangulated meshes derived from Objaverse-XL and Thingi10K datasets. We demonstrate the utility of this dataset by finetuning GPT-2 on a subset of the dataset for G-code translation from a legacy G-code format (Sailfish) to a more modern, widely used format (Marlin). Our dataset can be found here. Slice-100K will be the first step in developing a multimodal foundation model for digital manufacturing."
Poster,Slicing Vision Transformer for Flexible Inference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92963,"Yitian Zhang, n n, Xu Ma, Huan Wang, Ke Ma, Stephen Chen, Derek Hu, Yun Fu","Vision Transformers (ViT) is known for its scalability. In this work, we target to scale down a ViT to fit in an environment with dynamic-changing resource constraints. We observe that smaller ViTs are intrinsically the sub-networks of a larger ViT with different widths. Thus, we propose a general framework, named Scala, to enable a single network to represent multiple smaller ViTs with flexible inference capability, which aligns with the inherent design of ViT to vary from widths. Concretely, Scala activates several subnets during training, introduces Isolated Activation to disentangle the smallest sub-network from other subnets, and leverages Scale Coordination to ensure each sub-network receives simplified, steady, and accurate learning objectives. Comprehensive empirical validations on different tasks demonstrate that with only one-shot training, Scala learns slimmable representation without modifying the original ViT structure and matches the performance of Separate Training. Compared with the prior art, Scala achieves an average improvement of 1.6% on ImageNet-1K with fewer parameters."
Poster,Slight Corruption in Pre-training Data Makes Better Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94917,"Hao Chen, Yujin Han, Diganta Misra, Xiang Li, Kai Hu, Difan Zou, Masashi Sugiyama, Jindong Wang, Bhiksha Raj","Diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in generating realistic high-quality images, audios, and videos. They benefit significantly from extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets, including web-crawled data with paired data and conditions, such as image-text and image-class pairs.Despite rigorous filtering, these pre-training datasets often inevitably contain corrupted pairs where conditions do not accurately describe the data. This paper presents the first comprehensive study on the impact of such corruption in pre-training data of DMs.We synthetically corrupt ImageNet-1K and CC3M to pre-train and evaluate over $50$ conditional DMs. Our empirical findings reveal that various types of slight corruption in pre-training can significantly enhance the quality, diversity, and fidelity of the generated images across different DMs, both during pre-training and downstream adaptation stages. Theoretically, we consider a Gaussian mixture model and prove that slight corruption in the condition leads to higher entropy and a reduced 2-Wasserstein distance to the ground truth of the data distribution generated by the corruptly trained DMs.Inspired by our analysis, we propose a simple method to improve the training of DMs on practical datasets by adding condition embedding perturbations (CEP).CEP significantly improves the performance of various DMs in both pre-training and downstream tasks.We hope that our study provides new insights into understanding the data and pre-training processes of DMs."
Poster,SlimGPT: Layer-wise Structured Pruning for Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95477,"Gui Ling, Ziyang Wang, YuliangYan, Qingwen Liu","Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for their remarkable capabilities across various domains, whose vast parameter scales present challenges for practical deployment. Structured pruning is an effective method to balance model performance with efficiency, but performance restoration under computational resource constraints is a principal challenge in pruning LLMs. Therefore, we present a low-cost and fast structured pruning method for LLMs named SlimGPT based on the Optimal Brain Surgeon framework. We propose Batched Greedy Pruning for rapid and near-optimal pruning, which enhances the accuracy of head-wise pruning error estimation through grouped Cholesky decomposition and improves the pruning efficiency of FFN via Dynamic Group Size, thereby achieving approximate local optimal pruning results within one hour. Besides, we explore the limitations of layer-wise pruning from the perspective of error accumulation and propose Incremental Pruning Ratio, a non-uniform pruning strategy to reduce performance degradation. Experimental results on the LLaMA benchmark show that SlimGPT outperforms other methods and achieves state-of-the-art results."
