Poster,Partial observation can induce mechanistic mismatches in data-constrained models of neural dynamics,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95614,"William Qian, Jacob Zavatone-Veth, Ben Ruben, Cengiz Pehlevan","One of the central goals of neuroscience is to gain a mechanistic understanding of how the dynamics of neural circuits give rise to their observed function. A popular approach towards this end is to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to reproduce experimental recordings of neural activity. These trained RNNs are then treated as surrogate models of biological neural circuits, whose properties can be dissected via dynamical systems analysis. How reliable are the mechanistic insights derived from this procedure? While recent advances in population-level recording technologies have allowed simultaneous recording of up to tens of thousands of neurons, this represents only a tiny fraction of most cortical circuits. Here we show that observing only a subset of neurons in a circuit can create mechanistic mismatches between a simulated teacher network and a data-constrained student, even when the two networks have matching single-unit dynamics. In particular, we show that partial observation of models of low-dimensional cortical dynamics based on functionally feedforward or low-rank connectivity can lead to surrogate models with spurious attractor structure. In total, our results illustrate the challenges inherent in accurately uncovering neural mechanisms from single-trial data, and suggest the need for new methods of validating data-constrained models for neural dynamics."
Poster,Partial Structure Discovery is Sufficient for No-regret Learning in Causal Bandits,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93277,"Muhammad Qasim Elahi, Mahsa Ghasemi, Murat Kocaoglu","Causal knowledge about the relationships among decision variables and a reward variable in a bandit setting can accelerate the learning of an optimal decision. Current works often assume the causal graph is known, which may not always be available a priori. Motivated by this challenge, we focus on the causal bandit problem in scenarios where the underlying causal graph is unknown and may include latent confounders. While intervention on the parents of the reward node is optimal in the absence of latent confounders, this is not necessarily the case in general. Instead, one must consider a set of possibly optimal arms/interventions, each being a special subset of the ancestors of the reward node, making causal discovery beyond the parents of the reward node essential. For regret minimization, we identify that discovering the full causal structure is unnecessary; however, no existing work provides the necessary and sufficient components of the causal graph. We formally characterize the set of necessary and sufficient latent confounders one needs to detect or learn to ensure that all possibly optimal arms are identified correctly. We also propose a randomized algorithm for learning the causal graph with a limited number of samples, providing a sample complexity guarantee for any desired confidence level. In the causal bandit setup, we propose a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we learn the induced subgraph on ancestors of the reward, along with a necessary and sufficient subset of latent confounders, to construct the set of possibly optimal arms. We show that for our proposed algorithm, the number of intervention samples required to learn the set of possibly optimal arms scales polynomially with respect to the number of nodes. The second phase involves the application of a standard bandit algorithm, such as the UCB algorithm. We also establish a regret bound for our two-phase approach, which is sublinear in the number of rounds."
Poster,Partial Transportability for Domain Generalization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96813,"Kasra Jalaldoust, Alexis Bellot, Elias Bareinboim","A fundamental task in AI is providing performance guarantees for predictions made in unseen domains. In practice, there can be substantial uncertainty about the distribution of new data, and corresponding variability in the performance of existing predictors. Building on the theory of partial identification and transportability, this paper introduces new results for bounding the value of a functional of the target distribution, such as the generalization error of a classifiers, given data from source domains and assumptions about the data generating mechanisms, encoded in causal diagrams. Our contribution is to provide the first general estimation technique for transportability problems, adapting existing parameterization schemes such Neural Causal Models to encode the structural constraints necessary for cross-population inference. We demonstrate the expressiveness and consistency of this procedure and further propose a gradient-based optimization scheme for making scalable inferences in practice. Our results are corroborated with experiments."
Poster,Particle Semi-Implicit Variational Inference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93584,"Jen Ning Lim, Adam Johansen","Semi-implicit variational inference (SIVI) enriches the expressiveness of variationalfamilies by utilizing a kernel and a mixing distribution to hierarchically define thevariational distribution. Existing SIVI methods parameterize the mixing distributionusing implicit distributions, leading to intractable variational densities. As a result,directly maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO) is not possible, so theyresort to one of the following: optimizing bounds on the ELBO, employing costlyinner-loop Markov chain Monte Carlo runs, or solving minimax objectives. In thispaper, we propose a novel method for SIVI called Particle Variational Inference(PVI) which employs empirical measures to approximate the optimal mixingdistributions characterized as the minimizer of a free energy functional. PVI arisesnaturally as a particle approximation of a Euclidean–Wasserstein gradient flow and,unlike prior works, it directly optimizes the ELBO whilst making no parametricassumption about the mixing distribution. Our empirical results demonstrate thatPVI performs favourably compared to other SIVI methods across various tasks.Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis of the behaviour of the gradient flowof a related free energy functional: establishing the existence and uniqueness ofsolutions as well as propagation of chaos results."
Poster,Paths to Equilibrium in Games,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95556,"Bora Yongacoglu, Gurdal Arslan, Lacra Pavel, Serdar Yuksel","In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and game theory, agents repeatedly interact and revise their strategies as new data arrives, producing a sequence of strategy profiles. This paper studies sequences of strategies satisfying a pairwise constraint inspired by policy updating in reinforcement learning, where an agent who is best responding in one period does not switch its strategy in the next period. This constraint merely requires that optimizing agents do not switch strategies, but does not constrain the non-optimizing agents in any way, and thus allows for exploration. Sequences with this property are called satisficing paths, and arise naturally in many MARL algorithms.  A fundamental question about strategic dynamics is such: for a given game and initial strategy profile, is it always possible to construct a satisficing path that terminates at an equilibrium? The resolution of this question has implications about the capabilities or limitations of a class of MARL algorithms. We answer this question in the affirmative for normal-form games. Our analysis reveals a counterintuitive insight that suboptimal, and perhaps even reward deteriorating, strategic updates are key to driving play to equilibrium along a satisficing path."
Poster,pcaGAN: Improving Posterior-Sampling cGANs via Principal Component Regularization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94657,"Matthew Bendel, Rizwan Ahmad, Philip Schniter","In ill-posed imaging inverse problems, there can exist many hypotheses that fit both the observed measurements and prior knowledge of the true image. Rather than returning just one hypothesis of that image, posterior samplers aim to explore the full solution space by generating many probable hypotheses, which can later be used to quantify uncertainty or construct recoveries that appropriately navigate the perception/distortion trade-off. In this work, we propose a fast and accurate posterior-sampling conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) that, through a novel form of regularization, aims for correctness in the posterior mean as well as the trace and K principal components of the posterior covariance matrix. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms competitors in a wide range of ill-posed imaging inverse problems."
Poster,PCoTTA: Continual Test-Time Adaptation for Multi-Task Point Cloud Understanding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96487,"Jincen Jiang, Qianyu Zhou, Yuhang Li, Xinkui Zhao, Meili Wang, Lizhuang Ma, Jian Chang, Jian.J Zhang, Xuequan Lu","In this paper, we present PCoTTA, an innovative, pioneering framework for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CoTTA) in multi-task point cloud understanding, enhancing the model's transferability towards the continually changing target domain. We introduce a multi-task setting for PCoTTA, which is practical and realistic, handling multiple tasks within one unified model during the continual adaptation. Our PCoTTA involves three key components: automatic prototype mixture (APM), Gaussian Splatted feature shifting (GSFS), and contrastive prototype repulsion (CPR). Firstly, APM is designed to automatically mix the source prototypes with the learnable prototypes with a similarity balancing factor, avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Then, GSFS dynamically shifts the testing sample toward the source domain, mitigating error accumulation in an online manner. In addition, CPR is proposed to pull the nearest learnable prototype close to the testing feature and push it away from other prototypes, making each prototype distinguishable during the adaptation. Experimental comparisons lead to a new benchmark,  demonstrating PCoTTA's superiority in boosting the model's transferability towards the continually changing target domain. Our source code is available at: https://github.com/Jinec98/PCoTTA."
Poster,PCP-MAE: Learning to Predict Centers for Point Masked Autoencoders,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94036,"Xiangdong Zhang, Shaofeng Zhang, Junchi Yan","Masked autoencoder has been widely explored in point cloud self-supervised learning, whereby the point cloud is generally divided into visible and masked parts. These methods typically include an encoder accepting visible patches (normalized) and corresponding patch centers (position) as input, with the decoder accepting the output of the encoder and the centers (position) of the masked parts to reconstruct each point in the masked patches. Then, the pre-trained encoders are used for downstream tasks. In this paper, we show a motivating empirical result that when directly feeding the centers of masked patches to the decoder without information from the encoder, it still reconstructs well. In other words, the centers of patches are important and the reconstruction objective does not necessarily rely on representations of the encoder, thus preventing the encoder from learning semantic representations. Based on this key observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, $i.e.$, learning to \textbf{P}redict \textbf{C}enters for \textbf{P}oint \textbf{M}asked \textbf{A}uto\textbf{E}ncoders (\textbf{PCP-MAE}) which guides the model to learn to predict the significant centers and use the predicted centers to replace the directly provided centers. Specifically, we propose a Predicting Center Module (PCM) that shares parameters with the original encoder with extra cross-attention to predict centers. Our method is of high pre-training efficiency compared to other alternatives and achieves great improvement over Point-MAE, particularly surpassing it by \textbf{5.50\% on OBJ-BG, 6.03\% on OBJ-ONLY, and 5.17\% on PB-T50-RS} for 3D object classification on the ScanObjectNN dataset. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/aHapBean/PCP-MAE}."
Poster,PEACE: A Dataset of Pharmaceutical Care for Cancer Pain Analgesia Evaluation and Medication Decision,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97596,"Yutao Dou, Huimin Yu, Wei Li, Jingyang Li, Fei Xia, Jian Xiao","Over half of cancer patients experience long-term pain management challenges. Recently, interest has grown in systems for cancer pain treatment effectiveness assessment (TEA) and medication recommendation (MR) to optimize pharmacological care. These systems aim to improve treatment effectiveness by recommending personalized medication plans based on comprehensive patient information. Despite progress, current systems lack multidisciplinary treatment (MDT) team assessments of treatment and the patient's perception of medication, crucial for effective cancer pain management. Moreover, managing cancer pain medication requires multiple adjustments to the treatment plan based on the patient's evolving condition, a detail often missing in existing datasets. To tackle these issues, we designed the PEACE dataset specifically for cancer pain medication research. It includes detailed pharmacological care records for over 38,000 patients, covering demographics, clinical examination, treatment outcomes, medication plans, and patient self-perceptions. Unlike existing datasets, PEACE records not only long-term and multiple follow-ups both inside and outside hospitals but also includes patients' self-assessments of medication effects and the impact on their lives. We conducted a proof-of-concept study with 13 machine learning algorithms on the PEACE dataset for the TEA (classification task) and MR (regression task). These experiments provide valuable insights into the potential of the PEACE dataset for advancing personalized cancer pain management.

Poster,PEAC: Unsupervised Pre-training for Cross-Embodiment Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95555,"Chengyang Ying, Hao Zhongkai, Xinning Zhou, Xuezhou Xu, Hang Su, Xingxing Zhang, Jun Zhu","Designing generalizable agents capable of adapting to diverse embodiments has achieved significant attention in Reinforcement Learning (RL), which is critical for deploying RL agents in various real-world applications. Previous Cross-Embodiment RL approaches have focused on transferring knowledge across embodiments within specific tasks. These methods often result in knowledge tightly coupled with those tasks and fail to adequately capture the distinct characteristics of different embodiments. To address this limitation, we introduce the notion of Cross-Embodiment Unsupervised RL (CEURL), which leverages unsupervised learning to enable agents to acquire embodiment-aware and task-agnostic knowledge through online interactions within reward-free environments. We formulate CEURL as a novel Controlled Embodiment Markov Decision Process (CE-MDP) and systematically analyze CEURL's pre-training objectives under CE-MDP. Based on these analyses, we develop a novel algorithm Pre-trained Embodiment-Aware Control (PEAC) for handling CEURL, incorporating an intrinsic reward function specifically designed for cross-embodiment pre-training. PEAC not only provides an intuitive optimization strategy for cross-embodiment pre-training but also can integrate flexibly with existing unsupervised RL methods, facilitating cross-embodiment exploration and skill discovery. Extensive experiments in both simulated (e.g., DMC and Robosuite) and real-world environments (e.g., legged locomotion) demonstrate that PEAC significantly improves adaptation performance and cross-embodiment generalization, demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming the unique challenges of CEURL.
