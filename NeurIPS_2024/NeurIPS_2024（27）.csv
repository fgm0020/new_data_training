Poster,Analyzing & Reducing the Need for Learning Rate Warmup in GPT Training,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94618,"Atli Kosson, Bettina Messmer, Martin Jaggi","Learning Rate Warmup is a popular heuristic for training neural networks, especially at larger batch sizes, despite limited understanding of its benefits. Warmup decreases the update size $\Delta \mathbf{w}_t = \eta_t \mathbf{u}_t$ early in training by using lower values for the learning rate $\eta_t$. In this work we argue that warmup benefits training by keeping the overall size of $\Delta \mathbf{w}_t$ limited, counteracting large initial values of $\mathbf{u}_t$. Focusing on small-scale GPT training with AdamW/Lion, we explore the following question: *Why and by which criteria are early updates $\mathbf{u}_t$ too large?* We analyze different metrics for the update size including the $\ell_2$-norm, resulting directional change, and impact on the representations of the network, providing a new perspective on warmup. In particular, we find that warmup helps counteract large angular updates as well as a limited critical batch size early in training. Finally, we show that the need for warmup can be significantly reduced or eliminated by modifying the optimizer to explicitly normalize $\mathbf{u}_t$ based on the aforementioned metrics."
Poster,An Analysis of Elo Rating Systems via Markov Chains,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93904,"Sam Olesker-Taylor, Luca Zanetti","We present a theoretical analysis of the Elo rating system, a popular method for ranking skills of players in an online setting. In particular, we study Elo under the Bradley-Terry-Luce model and, using techniques from Markov chain theory, show that Elo learns the model parameters at a rate competitive with the state-of-the-art. We apply our results to the problem of efficient tournament design and discuss a connection with the fastest-mixing Markov chain problem."
Poster,An Analysis of Robustness of Non-Lipschitz Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/98321,"Maria-Florina Balcan, Avrim Blum, Dravyansh Sharma, Hongyang Zhang","Despite significant advances, deep networks remain highly susceptible to adversarial attack.  One fundamental challenge is that small input perturbations can often produce large movements in the network’s final-layer feature space.  In this paper, we define an attack model that abstracts this challenge, to help understand its intrinsic properties.  In our model, the adversary may move data an arbitrary distance in feature space but only in random low-dimensional subspaces.  We prove such adversaries can be quite powerful: defeating any algorithm that must classify any input it is given.  However, by allowing the algorithm to abstain on unusual inputs, we show such adversaries can be overcome when classes are reasonably well-separated in feature space. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for setting algorithm parameters to optimize over accuracy-abstention trade-offs using data-driven methods. Our results provide new robustness guarantees for nearest-neighbor style algorithms, and also have application to contrastive learning, where we empirically demonstrate the ability of such algorithms to obtain high robust accuracy with low abstention rates.  Our model is also motivated by strategic classification, where entities being classified aim to manipulate their observable features to produce a preferred classification, and we provide new insights into that area as well."
Poster,An Analysis of Tokenization: Transformers under Markov Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93124,"Nived Rajaraman, Jiantao Jiao, Kannan Ramchandran","While there has been a large body of research attempting to circumvent tokenization for language modeling (Clark et al. 2022, Xue et al. 2022), the current consensus is that it is a necessary initial step for designing state-of-the-art performant language models. In this paper, we investigate tokenization from a theoretical point of view by studying the behavior of transformers on simple data generating processes. When trained on data drawn from certain simple $k^{\text{th}}$-order Markov processes for $k > 1$, transformers exhibit a surprising phenomenon - in the absence of tokenization, they empirically are incredibly slow or fail to learn the right distribution and predict characters according to a unigram model (Makkuva et al. 2024). With the addition of tokenization, however, we empirically observe that transformers break through this barrier and are able to model the probabilities of sequences drawn from the source near-optimally, achieving small cross-entropy loss. With this observation as starting point, we study the end-to-end cross-entropy loss achieved by transformers with and without tokenization. With the appropriate tokenization, we show that even the simplest unigram models (over tokens) learnt by transformers are able to model the probability of sequences drawn from $k^{\text{th}}$-order Markov sources near optimally. Our analysis provides a justification for the use of tokenization in practice through studying the behavior of transformers on Markovian data."
Poster,An Analytical Study of Utility Functions in Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95682,"Manel Rodríguez Soto, Juan A Rodríguez-Aguilar, Maite López-Sánchez","Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) is an excellent framework for multi-objective sequential decision-making. MORL employs a utility function to aggregate multiple objectives into one that expresses a user's preferences. However, MORL still misses two crucial theoretical analyses of the properties of utility functions: (1) a characterisation of the utility functions for which an associated optimal policy exists, and (2) a characterisation of the types of preferences that can be expressed as utility functions. As a result, we formally characterise the families of preferences and utility functions that MORL should focus on: those for which an optimal policy is guaranteed to exist. We expect our theoretical results to promote the development of novel MORL algorithms that exploit our theoretical findings."
Poster,An Autoencoder-Like Nonnegative Matrix Co-Factorization for Improved Student Cognitive Modeling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96371,"Shenbao Yu, Yinghui Pan, Yifeng Zeng, Prashant Doshi, Guoquan Liu, Kim-Leng Poh, Mingwei Lin","Student cognitive modeling (SCM) is a fundamental task in intelligent education, with applications ranging from personalized learning to educational resource allocation. By exploiting students' response logs, SCM aims to predict their exercise performance as well as estimate knowledge proficiency in a subject. Data mining approaches such as matrix factorization can obtain high accuracy in predicting student performance on exercises, but the knowledge proficiency is unknown or poorly estimated. The situation is further exacerbated if only sparse interactions exist between exercises and students (or knowledge concepts). To solve this dilemma, we root monotonicity (a fundamental psychometric theory on educational assessments) in a co-factorization framework and present an autoencoder-like nonnegative matrix co-factorization (AE-NMCF), which improves the accuracy of estimating the student's knowledge proficiency via an encoder-decoder learning pipeline. The resulting estimation problem is nonconvex with nonnegative constraints. We introduce a projected gradient method based on block coordinate descent with Lipschitz constants and guarantee the method's theoretical convergence. Experiments on several real-world data sets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in terms of both performance prediction accuracy and knowledge estimation ability, when compared with existing student cognitive models."
Poster,A Nearly Optimal and Low-Switching Algorithm for Reinforcement Learning with General Function Approximation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93405,"Heyang Zhao, Jiafan He, Quanquan Gu","The exploration-exploitation dilemma has been a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) with complex model classes. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, Monotonic  Q-Learning with Upper Confidence Bound (MQL-UCB) for RL with general function approximation. Our key algorithmic design includes (1) a general deterministic policy-switching strategy that achieves low switching cost, (2) a monotonic value function structure with carefully controlled function class complexity, and (3) a variance-weighted regression scheme that exploits historical trajectories with high data efficiency. MQL-UCB achieves minimax optimal regret of $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{HK})$ when $K$ is sufficiently large and near-optimal policy switching cost of $\tilde{O}(dH)$, with $d$ being the eluder dimension of the function class, $H$ being the planning horizon, and $K$ being the number of episodes.    Our work sheds light on designing provably sample-efficient and deployment-efficient Q-learning with nonlinear function approximation."
Poster,A Near-optimal Algorithm for Learning Margin Halfspaces with Massart Noise,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96653,"Ilias Diakonikolas, Nikos Zarifis","We study the problem of PAC learning $\gamma$-margin halfspaces in the presence of Massart noise. Without computational considerations, the sample complexity of this learning problem is known to be $\widetilde{\Theta}(1/(\gamma^2 \epsilon))$. Prior computationally efficient algorithms for the problem incur sample complexity $\tilde{O}(1/(\gamma^4 \epsilon^3))$ and achieve 0-1 error of $\eta+\epsilon$, where $\eta<1/2$ is the upper bound on the noise rate.Recent work gave evidence of an information-computation tradeoff, suggesting that a quadratic dependence on $1/\epsilon$ is required for computationally efficient algorithms. Our main result is a computationally efficient learner with sample complexity $\widetilde{\Theta}(1/(\gamma^2 \epsilon^2))$, nearly matching this lower bound. In addition, our algorithm is simple and practical, relying on online SGD on a carefully selected sequence of convex losses."
Poster,An effective framework for estimating individualized treatment rules,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95928,"Joowon Lee, Jared Huling, Guanhua Chen","Estimating individualized treatment rules (ITRs) is fundamental in causal inference, particularly for precision medicine applications. Traditional ITR estimation methods rely on inverse probability weighting (IPW) to address confounding factors and $L_{1}$-penalization for simplicity and interpretability. However, IPW can introduce statistical bias without precise propensity score modeling, while $L_1$-penalization makes the objective non-smooth, leading to computational bias and requiring subgradient methods. In this paper, we propose a unified ITR estimation framework formulated as a constrained, weighted, and smooth convex optimization problem. The optimal ITR can be robustly and effectively computed by projected gradient descent. Our comprehensive theoretical analysis reveals that weights that balance the spectrum of a `weighted design matrix' improve both the optimization and likelihood landscapes, yielding improved computational and statistical estimation guarantees. In particular, this is achieved by distributional covariate balancing weights, which are model-free alternatives to IPW. Extensive simulations and applications demonstrate that our framework achieves significant gains in both robustness and effectiveness for ITR learning against existing methods."
Poster,An Efficient High-dimensional Gradient Estimator for Stochastic Differential Equations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96481,"Shengbo Wang, Jose Blanchet, Peter W Glynn","Overparameterized stochastic differential equation (SDE) models have achieved remarkable success in various complex environments, such as PDE-constrained optimization, stochastic control and reinforcement learning, financial engineering, and neural SDEs. These models often feature system evolution coefficients that are parameterized by a high-dimensional vector $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^n$, aiming to optimize expectations of the SDE, such as a value function, through stochastic gradient ascent. Consequently, designing efficient gradient estimators for which the computational complexity scales well with $n$ is of significant interest. This paper introduces a novel unbiased stochastic gradient estimator—the generator gradient estimator—for which the computation time remains stable in $n$. In addition to establishing the validity of our methodology for general SDEs with jumps, we also perform numerical experiments that test our estimator in linear-quadratic control problems parameterized by high-dimensional neural networks. The results show a significant improvement in efficiency compared to the widely used pathwise differentiation method: Our estimator achieves near-constant computation times, increasingly outperforms its counterpart as $n$ increases, and does so without compromising estimation variance. These empirical findings highlight the potential of our proposed methodology for optimizing SDEs in contemporary applications."
