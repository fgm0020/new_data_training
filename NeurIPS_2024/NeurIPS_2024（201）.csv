Poster,In-Context Symmetries: Self-Supervised Learning through Contextual World Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94239,"Sharut Gupta, Chenyu Wang, Yifei Wang, Tommi Jaakkola, Stefanie Jegelka","At the core of self-supervised learning for vision is the idea of learning invariant or equivariant representations with respect to a set of data transformations. This approach, however, introduces strong inductive biases, which can render the representations fragile in downstream tasks that do not conform to these symmetries. In this work, drawing insights from world models, we propose to instead learn a general representation that can adapt to be invariant or equivariant to different transformations by paying attention to context --- a memory module that tracks task-specific states, actions and future states. Here, the action is the transformation, while the current and future states respectively represent the input's representation before and after the transformation.  Our proposed algorithm, Contextual Self Supervised Learning (ContextSSL), learns equivariance to all transformations (as opposed to invariance). In this way, the model can learn to encode all relevant features as general representations while having the versatility to tail down to task-wise symmetries when given a few examples as the context. Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains over existing methods on equivariance-related tasks, supported by both qualitative and quantitative evaluations."
Poster,Incorporating Surrogate Gradient Norm to Improve Offline Optimization Techniques,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94535,"Cuong Dao, Phi Le Nguyen, Truong Thao Nguyen, Nghia Hoang","Offline optimization has recently emerged as an increasingly popular approach to mitigate the prohibitively expensive cost of online experimentation. The key idea is to learn a surrogate of the black-box function that underlines the target experiment using a static (offline) dataset of its previous input-output queries. Such an approach is, however, fraught with an out-of-distribution issue where the learned surrogate becomes inaccurate outside the offline data regimes. To mitigate this, existing offline optimizers have proposed numerous conditioning techniques to prevent the learned surrogate from being too erratic. Nonetheless, such conditioning strategies are often specific to particular surrogate or search models, which might not generalize to a different model choice. This motivates us to develop a model-agnostic approach instead, which incorporates a notion of model sharpness into the training loss of the surrogate as a regularizer. Our approach is supported by a new theoretical analysis demonstrating that reducing surrogate sharpness on the offline dataset provably reduces its generalized sharpness on unseen data. Our analysis extends existing theories from bounding generalized prediction loss (on unseen data) with loss sharpness to bounding the worst-case generalized surrogate sharpness with its empirical estimate on training data, providing a new perspective on sharpness regularization. Our extensive experimentation on a diverse range of optimization tasks also shows that reducing surrogate sharpness often leads to significant improvement, marking (up to) a noticeable 9.6% performance boost. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/cuong-dm/IGNITE."
Poster,Incorporating Test-Time Optimization into Training with Dual Networks for Human Mesh Recovery,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93255,"Yongwei Nie, Mingxian Fan, Chengjiang Long, Qing Zhang, Jian Zhu, Xuemiao Xu","Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) is the task of estimating a parameterized 3D human mesh from an image. There is a kind of methods first training a regression model for this problem, then further optimizing the pretrained regression model for any specific sample individually at test time. However, the pretrained model may not provide an ideal optimization starting point for the test-time optimization. Inspired by meta-learning, we incorporate the test-time optimization into training, performing a step of test-time optimization for each sample in the training batch before really conducting the training optimization over all the training samples. In this way, we obtain a meta-model, the meta-parameter of which is friendly to the test-time optimization. At test time, after several test-time optimization steps starting from the meta-parameter, we obtain much higher HMR accuracy than the test-time optimization starting from the simply pretrained regression model. Furthermore, we find test-time HMR objectives are different from training-time objectives, which reduces the effectiveness of the learning of the meta-model. To solve this problem, we propose a dual-network architecture that unifies the training-time and test-time objectives. Our method, armed with meta-learning and the dual networks, outperforms state-of-the-art regression-based and optimization-based HMR approaches, as validated by the extensive experiments. The codes are available at https://github.com/fmx789/Meta-HMR."
Poster,Incremental Learning of Retrievable Skills For Efficient Continual Task Adaptation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95159,"Daehee Lee, Minjong Yoo, Woo Kyung Kim, Wonje Choi, Honguk Woo","Continual Imitation Learning (CiL) involves extracting and accumulating task knowledge from demonstrations across multiple stages and tasks to achieve a multi-task policy. With recent advancements in foundation models, there has been a growing interest in adapter-based CiL approaches, where adapters are established parameter-efficiently for tasks newly demonstrated. While these approaches isolate parameters for specific tasks and tend to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, they limit knowledge sharing among different demonstrations. We introduce IsCiL, an adapter-based CiL framework that addresses this limitation of knowledge sharing by incrementally learning shareable skills from different demonstrations, thus enabling sample-efficient task adaptation using the skills particularly in non-stationary CiL environments. In IsCiL, demonstrations are mapped into the state embedding space, where proper skills can be retrieved upon input states through prototype-based memory. These retrievable skills are incrementally learned on their corresponding adapters. Our CiL experiments with complex tasks in the Franka-Kitchen and Meta-World demonstrate the robust performance of IsCiL in both task adaptation and sample-efficiency. We also show a simple extension of IsCiL for task unlearning scenarios."
Poster,INDICT: Code Generation with Internal Dialogues of Critiques for Both Security and Helpfulness,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93974,"Hung Le, Doyen Sahoo, Yingbo Zhou, Caiming Xiong, Silvio Savarese","Large language models (LLMs) for code are typically trained to align with natural language instructions to closely follow their intentions and requirements. However, in many practical scenarios, it becomes increasingly challenging for these models to navigate the intricate boundary between helpfulness and safety, especially against highly complex yet potentially malicious instructions. In this work, we introduce INDICT: a new framework that empowers LLMs with Internal Dialogues of Critiques for both safety and helpfulness guidance. The internal dialogue is a dual cooperative system between a safety-driven critic and a helpfulness-driven critic. Each critic provides analysis against the given task and corresponding generated response, equipped with external knowledge queried through relevant code snippets and tools like web search and code interpreter. We engage the dual critic system in both code generation stage as well as code execution stage, providing preemptive and post-hoc guidance respectively to LLMs. We evaluated INDICT on 8 diverse tasks across 8 programming languages from 5 benchmarks, using LLMs from 7B to 70B parameters. We observed that our approach can provide an advanced level of critiques of both safety and helpfulness analysis, significantly improving the quality of output codes (+10% absolute improvements in all models)."
Poster,IndicVoices-R: Unlocking a Massive Multilingual Multi-speaker Speech Corpus for Scaling Indian TTS,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97858,"Ashwin Sankar, Srija Anand, Praveen Varadhan, Sherry Thomas, Mehak Singal, Shridhar Kumar, Deovrat Mehendale, Aditi Krishana, Giri Raju, Mitesh Khapra","Recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis show that large-scale models trained with extensive web data produce highly natural-sounding output. However, such data is scarce for Indian languages due to the lack of high-quality, manually subtitled data on platforms like LibriVox or YouTube. To address this gap, we enhance existing large-scale ASR datasets containing natural conversations collected in low-quality environments to generate high-quality TTS training data. Our pipeline leverages the cross-lingual generalization of denoising and speech enhancement models trained on English and applied to Indian languages. This results in IndicVoices-R (IV-R), the largest multilingual Indian TTS dataset derived from an ASR dataset, with 1,704 hours of high-quality speech from 10,496 speakers across 22 Indian languages. IV-R matches the quality of gold-standard TTS datasets like LJSpeech, LibriTTS, and IndicTTS. We also introduce the IV-R Benchmark, the first to assess zero-shot, few-shot, and many-shot speaker generalization capabilities of TTS models on Indian voices, ensuring diversity in age, gender, and style. We demonstrate that fine-tuning an English pre-trained model on a combined dataset of high-quality IndicTTS and our IV-R dataset results in better zero-shot speaker generalization compared to fine-tuning on the IndicTTS dataset alone. Further, our evaluation reveals limited zero-shot generalization for Indian voices in TTS models trained on prior datasets, which we improve by fine-tuning the model on our data containing diverse set of speakers across language families. We open-source code and data for all 22 official Indian languages."
Poster,Indoor Air Quality Dataset with Activities of Daily Living in Low to Middle-income Communities,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97565,"Prasenjit Karmakar, Swadhin Pradhan, Sandip Chakraborty","In recent years, indoor air pollution has posed a significant threat to our society, claiming over 3.2 million lives annually. Developing nations, such as India, are most affected since lack of knowledge, inadequate regulation, and outdoor air pollution lead to severe daily exposure to pollutants. However, only a limited number of studies have attempted to understand how indoor air pollution affects developing countries like India. To address this gap, we present spatiotemporal measurements of air quality from 30 indoor sites over six months during summer and winter seasons. The sites are geographically located across four regions of type: rural, suburban, and urban, covering the typical low to middle-income population in India. The dataset contains various types of indoor environments (e.g., studio apartments, classrooms, research laboratories, food canteens, and residential households), and can provide the basis for data-driven learning model research aimed at coping with unique pollution patterns in developing countries. This unique dataset demands advanced data cleaning and imputation techniques for handling missing data due to power failure or network outages during data collection. Furthermore, through a simple speech-to-text application, we provide real-time indoor activity labels annotated by occupants. Therefore, environmentalists and ML enthusiasts can utilize this dataset to understand the complex patterns of the pollutants under different indoor activities, identify recurring sources of pollution, forecast exposure, improve floor plans and room structures of modern indoor designs, develop pollution-aware recommender systems, etc."
Poster,Induced Model Matching: Restricted Models Help Train Full-Featured Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94001,"Usama Muneeb, Mesrob I Ohannessian","We consider scenarios where a very accurate (often small) predictive model using restricted features is available when training a full-featured (often larger) model. This restricted model may be thought of as ``side-information'', and can come either from an auxiliary dataset or from the same dataset by forcing the restriction. How can the restricted model be useful to the full model? To answer this, we introduce a methodology called Induced Model Matching (IMM). IMM aligns the context-restricted, or induced, version of the large model with the restricted model. We relate IMM to approaches such as noising, which is implicit in addressing the problem, and reverse knowledge distillation from weak teachers, which is explicit but does not exploit restriction being the nature of the weakness. We show that these prior methods can be thought of as approximations to IMM and can be problematic in terms of consistency. Experimentally, we first motivate IMM using logistic regression as a toy example. We then explore it in language modeling, the application that initially inspired it, and demonstrate it on both LSTM and transformer full models, using bigrams as restricted models. We lastly give a simple RL example, which shows that POMDP policies can help learn better MDP policies. The IMM principle is thus generally applicable in common scenarios where restricted data is cheaper to collect or restricted models are easier to learn."
Poster,Inductive biases of multi-task learning and finetuning: multiple regimes of feature reuse,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94934,"Samuel Lippl, Jack Lindsey","Neural networks are often trained on multiple tasks, either simultaneously (multi-task learning, MTL) or sequentially (pretraining and subsequent finetuning, PT+FT). In particular, it is common practice to pretrain neural networks on a large auxiliary task before finetuning on a downstream task with fewer samples. Despite the prevalence of this approach, the inductive biases that arise from learning multiple tasks are poorly characterized. In this work, we address this gap. We describe novel implicit regularization penalties associated with MTL and PT+FT in diagonal linear networks and single-hidden-layer ReLU networks. These penalties indicate that MTL and PT+FT induce the network to reuse features in different ways. 1) Both MTL and PT+FT exhibit biases towards feature reuse between tasks, and towards sparsity in the set of learned features. We show a ""conservation law"" that implies a direct tradeoff between these two biases. 2) PT+FT exhibits a novel ""nested feature selection"" regime, not described by either the ""lazy"" or ""rich"" regimes identified in prior work, which biases it to *rely on a sparse subset* of the features learned during pretraining. This regime is much narrower for MTL. 3) PT+FT (but not MTL) in ReLU networks benefits from features that are correlated between the auxiliary and main task. We confirm these findings empirically with teacher-student models, and introduce a technique -- weight rescaling following pretraining -- that can elicit the nested feature selection regime. Finally, we validate our theory in deep neural networks trained on image classification. We find that weight rescaling improves performance when it causes models to display signatures of nested feature selection. Our results suggest that nested feature selection may be an important inductive bias for finetuning neural networks."
Poster,Inevitable Trade-off between Watermark Strength and Speculative Sampling Efficiency for Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96518,"Zhengmian Hu, Heng Huang","Large language models are probabilistic models, and the process of generating content is essentially sampling from the output distribution of the language model. Existing watermarking techniques inject watermarks into the generated content without altering the output quality. On the other hand, existing acceleration techniques, specifically speculative sampling, leverage a draft model to speed up the sampling process while preserving the output distribution. However, there is no known method to simultaneously accelerate the sampling process and inject watermarks into the generated content. In this paper, we investigate this direction and find that the integration of watermarking and acceleration is non-trivial. We prove a no-go theorem, which states that it is impossible to simultaneously maintain the highest watermark strength and the highest sampling efficiency. Furthermore, we propose two methods that maintain either the sampling efficiency or the watermark strength, but not both. Our work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for understanding the inherent trade-off between watermark strength and sampling efficiency in accelerating the generation of watermarked tokens for large language models. We also conduct numerical experiments to validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods."
