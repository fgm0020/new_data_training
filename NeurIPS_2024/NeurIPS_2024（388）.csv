Poster,Studying How to Efficiently and Effectively Guide Models with Explanations - A Reproducibility Study,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/99349,"Adrian Sauter, Milan Miletić, Ryan Ott, Rohith Prabakaran","Model guidance describes the approach of regularizing the explanations of a deep neu-
ral network model towards highlighting the correct features to ensure that the model is
“right for the right reasons”. Rao et al. (2023) conducted an in-depth evaluation of ef-
fective and efficient model guidance for object classification across various loss functions,
attributions methods, models, and ’guidance depths’ to study the effectiveness of differ-
ent methods. Our work aims to (1) reproduce the main results obtained by Rao et al.
(2023), and (2) propose several extensions to their research. We conclude that the major
part of the original work is reproducible, with certain minor exceptions, which we discuss
in this paper. In our extended work, we point to an issue with the Energy Pointing Game
(EPG) metric used for evaluation and propose an extension for increasing its robustness.
In addition, we observe the EPG metric’s predisposition towards favoring larger bounding
boxes, a bias we address by incorporating a corrective penalty term into the original En-
ergy loss function. Furthermore, we revisit the feasibility of using segmentation masks in
light of the original study’s finding that minimal annotated data can significantly boost
model performance. Our findings suggests that Energy loss inherently guides models to
on-object features without the requirement for segmentation masks. Finally, we explore
the role of contextual information in object detection and, contrary to the assumption
that focusing solely on object-specific features suffices for accurate classification, our find-
ings suggest the importance of contextual cues in certain scenarios.

Poster,Style Adaptation and Uncertainty Estimation for Multi-Source Blended-Target Domain Adaptation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95635,"Yuwu Lu, Haoyu Huang, Xue Hu","Blended-target domain adaptation (BTDA), which implicitly mixes multiple sub-target domains into a fine domain, has attracted more attention in recent years. Most previously developed BTDA approaches focus on utilizing a single source domain, which makes it difficult to obtain sufficient feature information for learning domain-invariant representations. Furthermore, different feature distributions derived from different domains may increase the uncertainty of models. To overcome these issues, we propose a style adaptation and uncertainty estimation (SAUE) approach for multi-source blended-target domain adaptation (MBDA). Specifically, we exploit the extra knowledge acquired from the blended-target domain, where a similarity factor is adopted to select more useful target style information for augmenting the source features. \!Then, to mitigate the negative impact of the domain-specific attributes, we devise a function to estimate and mitigate uncertainty in category prediction. Finally, we construct a simple and lightweight adversarial learning strategy for MBDA, effectively aligning multi-source and blended-target domains without the requirements of domain labels of the target domains. Extensive experiments conducted on several challenging DA benchmarks, including the ImageCLEF-DA, Office-Home, VisDA 2017, and DomainNet datasets, demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches."
Poster,Stylebreeder: Exploring and Democratizing Artistic Styles through Text-to-Image Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97783,"Matthew Zheng, Enis Simsar, Hidir Yesiltepe, Federico Tombari, Joel Simon, Pinar Yanardag Delul","Text-to-image models are becoming increasingly popular, revolutionizing the landscape of digital art creation by enabling highly detailed and creative visual content generation. These models have been widely employed across various domains, particularly in art generation, where they facilitate a broad spectrum of creative expression and democratize access to artistic creation. In this paper, we introduce STYLEBREEDER, a comprehensive dataset of 6.8M images and 1.8M prompts generated by 95K users on Artbreeder,  a platform that has emerged as a significant hub for creative exploration with over 13M users. We introduce a series of tasks with this dataset aimed at identifying diverse artistic styles, generating personalized content, and recommending styles based on user interests. By documenting unique, user-generated styles that transcend conventional categories like 'cyberpunk' or 'Picasso,' we explore the potential for unique, crowd-sourced styles that could provide deep insights into the collective creative psyche of users worldwide. We also evaluate different personalization methods to enhance artistic expression and introduce a style atlas, making these models available in LoRA format for public use. Our research demonstrates the potential of text-to-image diffusion models to uncover and promote unique artistic expressions, further democratizing AI in art and fostering a more diverse and inclusive artistic community.

Poster,Stylus: Automatic Adapter Selection for Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96747,"Michael Luo, Justin Wong, Brandon Trabucco, Yanping Huang, Joseph Gonzalez, zhifeng Chen, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Ion Stoica","Beyond scaling base models with more data or parameters, fine-tuned adapters provide an alternative way to generate high fidelity, custom images at reduced costs. As such, adapters have been widely adopted by open-source communities, accumulating a database of over 100K adapters—most of which are highly customized with insufficient descriptions. To generate high quality images, this paper explores the problem of matching the prompt to a Stylus of relevant adapters, built on recent work that highlight the performance gains of composing adapters. We introduce Stylus, which efficiently selects and automatically composes task-specific adapters based on a prompt's keywords. Stylus outlines a three-stage approach that first summarizes adapters with improved descriptions and embeddings, retrieves relevant adapters, and then further assembles adapters based on prompts' keywords by checking how well they fit the prompt. To evaluate Stylus, we developed StylusDocs, a curated dataset featuring 75K adapters with pre-computed adapter embeddings. In our evaluation on popular Stable Diffusion checkpoints, Stylus achieves greater CLIP/FID Pareto efficiency and is twice as preferred, with humans and multimodal models as evaluators, over the base model."
Poster,SubgDiff: A Subgraph Diffusion Model to Improve Molecular Representation Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94004,"JIYING ZHANG, Zijing Liu, Yu Wang, Bin Feng, Yu Li","Molecular representation learning has shown great success in advancing AI-based drug discovery. A key insight of many recent works is that the 3D geometric structure of molecules provides essential information about their physicochemical properties. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have achieved impressive performance in molecular 3D conformation generation.  However, most existing molecular diffusion models treat each atom as an independent entity, overlooking the dependency among atoms within the substructures. This paper introduces a novel approach that enhances molecular representation learning by incorporating substructural information in the diffusion model framework. We propose a novel diffusion model termed SubgDiff for involving the molecular subgraph information in diffusion. Specifically, SubgDiff adopts three vital techniques: i) subgraph prediction, ii) expectation state, and iii) k-step same subgraph diffusion, to enhance the perception of molecular substructure in the denoising network. Experiments on extensive downstream tasks, especially the molecular force predictions, demonstrate the superior performance of our approach."
Poster,Subject-driven Text-to-Image Generation via Preference-based Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95031,"Yanting Miao, William Loh, Suraj Kothawade, Pascal Poupart, Abdullah Rashwan, Yeqing Li","Text-to-image generative models have recently attracted considerable interest, enabling the synthesis of high-quality images from textual prompts. However, these models often lack the capability to generate specific subjects from given reference images or to synthesize novel renditions under varying conditions. Methods like DreamBooth and Subject-driven Text-to-Image (SuTI) have made significant progress in this area. Yet, both approaches primarily focus on enhancing similarity to reference images and require expensive setups, often overlooking the need for efficient training and avoiding overfitting to the reference images. In this work, we present the $\lambda$-Harmonic reward function, which provides a reliable reward signal and enables early stopping for faster training and effective regularization. By combining the Bradley-Terry preference model, the $\lambda$-Harmonic reward function also provides preference labels for subject-driven generation tasks. We propose Reward Preference Optimization (RPO), which offers a simpler setup (requiring only 3\% of the negative samples used by DreamBooth) and fewer gradient steps for fine-tuning. Unlike most existing methods, our approach does not require training a text encoder or optimizing text embeddings and achieves text-image alignment by fine-tuning only the U-Net component. Empirically, $\lambda$-Harmonic proves to be a reliable approach for model selection in subject-driven generation tasks. Based on preference labels and early stopping validation from the $\lambda$-Harmonic reward function, our algorithm achieves a state-of-the-art CLIP-I score of 0.833 and a CLIP-T score of 0.314 on DreamBench."
Poster,SubjECTive-QA: Measuring Subjectivity in Earnings Call Transcripts' QA Through Six-Dimensional Feature Analysis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97586,"Huzaifa Pardawala, Siddhant Sukhani, Agam Shah, Veer Kejriwal, Abhishek Pillai, Rohan Bhasin, Andrew DiBiasio, Tarun Mandapati, Dhruv Adha, Sudheer Chava","Fact-checking is extensively studied in the context of misinformation and disinformation, addressing objective inaccuracies. However, a softer form of misinformation involves responses that are factually correct but lack certain features such as clarity and relevance. This challenge is prevalent in formal Question-Answer (QA) settings such as press conferences in finance, politics, sports, and other domains, where subjective answers can obscure transparency. Despite this, there is a lack of manually annotated datasets for subjective features across multiple dimensions. To address this gap, we introduce SubjECTive-QA, a human annotated dataset on Earnings Call Transcripts' (ECTs) QA sessions as the answers given by company representatives are often open to subjective interpretations and scrutiny. The dataset includes 49,446 annotations for long-form QA pairs across six features: Assertive, Cautious, Optimistic, Specific, Clear, and Relevant. These features are carefully selected to encompass the key attributes that reflect the tone of the answers provided during QA sessions across different domains. Our findings are that the best-performing Pre-trained Language Model (PLM), RoBERTa-base, has similar weighted F1 scores to Llama-3-70b-Chat on features with lower subjectivity, such as Relevant and Clear, with a mean difference of 2.17% in their weighted F1 scores. The models perform significantly better on features with higher subjectivity, such as Specific and Assertive, with a mean difference of 10.01% in their weighted F1 scores. Furthermore, testing SubjECTive-QA's generalizability using QAs from White House Press Briefings and Gaggles yields an average weighted F1 score of 65.97% using our best models for each feature, demonstrating broader applicability beyond the financial domain.

Poster,Sub-optimal Experts mitigate Ambiguity in Inverse Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96405,"Riccardo Poiani, Curti Gabriele, Alberto Maria Metelli, Marcello Restelli","Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) deals with the problem of deducing a reward function that explains the behavior of an expert agent who is assumed to act *optimally* in an underlying unknown task. Recent works have studied the IRL problem from the perspective of recovering the *feasible reward set*, i.e., the class of reward functions that are compatible with a unique optimal expert. However, in several problems of interest it is possible to observe the behavior of multiple experts with different degree of optimality (e.g., racing drivers whose skills ranges from amateurs to professionals). For this reason, in this work, we focus on the reconstruction of the feasible reward set when, in addition to demonstrations from the optimal expert, we observe the behavior of multiple *sub-optimal experts*. Given this problem, we first study the theoretical properties showing that the presence of multiple sub-optimal experts, in addition to the optimal one, can significantly shrink the set of compatible rewards, ultimately mitigating the inherent ambiguity of IRL.Furthermore, we study the statistical complexity of estimating the feasible reward set with a generative model and analyze a uniform sampling algorithm that turns out to be minimax optimal whenever the sub-optimal experts' performance level is sufficiently close to that of the optimal expert."
Poster,Subsurface Scattering for Gaussian Splatting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96787,"Jan-Niklas Dihlmann, Arjun Majumdar, Andreas Engelhardt, Raphael Braun, Hendrik PA Lensch","3D reconstruction and relighting of objects made from scattering materials present a significant challenge due to the complex light transport beneath the surface. 3D Gaussian Splatting introduced high-quality novel view synthesis at real-time speeds. While 3D Gaussians efficiently approximate an object's surface, they fail to capture the volumetric properties of subsurface scattering. We propose a framework for optimizing an object's shape together with the radiance transfer field given multi-view OLAT (one light at a time) data. Our method decomposes the scene into an explicit surface represented as 3D Gaussians, with a spatially varying BRDF, and an implicit volumetric representation of the scattering component. A learned incident light field accounts for shadowing. We optimize all parameters jointly via ray-traced differentiable rendering. Our approach enables material editing, relighting, and novel view synthesis at interactive rates. We show successful application on synthetic data and contribute a newly acquired multi-view multi-light dataset of objects in a light-stage setup. Compared to previous work we achieve comparable or better results at a fraction of optimization and rendering time while enabling detailed control over material attributes."
Poster,Subwords as Skills: Tokenization for Sparse-Reward Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94819,"David Yunis, Justin Jung, Falcon Dai, Matthew Walter","Exploration in sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) is difficult due to the need for long, coordinated sequences of actions in order to achieve any reward. Skill learning, from demonstrations or interaction, is a promising approach to address this, but skill extraction and inference are expensive for current methods. We present a novel method to extract skills from demonstrations for use in sparse-reward RL, inspired by the popular Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm in natural language processing. With these skills, we show strong performance in a variety of tasks, 1000$\times$ acceleration for skill-extraction and 100$\times$ acceleration for policy inference. Given the simplicity of our method, skills extracted from 1\% of the demonstrations in one task can be transferred to a new loosely related task. We also note that such a method yields a finite set of interpretable behaviors. Our code is available at https://github.com/dyunis/subwords_as_skills."
