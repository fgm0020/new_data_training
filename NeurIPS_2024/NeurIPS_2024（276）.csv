Poster,NeuroClips: Towards High-fidelity and Smooth fMRI-to-Video Reconstruction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96344,"Zixuan Gong, Guangyin Bao, Qi Zhang, Zhongwei Wan, Duoqian Miao, Shoujin Wang, Lei Zhu, Changwei Wang, Rongtao Xu, Liang Hu, Ke Liu, Yu Zhang","Reconstruction of static visual stimuli from non-invasion brain activity fMRI achieves great success, owning to advanced deep learning models such as CLIP and Stable Diffusion. However, the research on fMRI-to-video reconstruction remains limited since decoding the spatiotemporal perception of continuous visual experiences is formidably challenging. We contend that the key to addressing these challenges lies in accurately decoding both high-level semantics and low-level perception flows, as perceived by the brain in response to video stimuli. To the end, we propose NeuroClips, an innovative framework to decode high-fidelity and smooth video from fMRI. NeuroClips utilizes a semantics reconstructor to reconstruct video keyframes, guiding semantic accuracy and consistency, and employs a perception reconstructor to capture low-level perceptual details, ensuring video smoothness. During inference, it adopts a pre-trained T2V diffusion model injected with both keyframes and low-level perception flows for video reconstruction. Evaluated on a publicly available fMRI-video dataset, NeuroClips achieves smooth high-fidelity video reconstruction of up to 6s at 8FPS, gaining significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in various metrics, e.g., a 128% improvement in SSIM and an 81% improvement in spatiotemporal metrics.

Poster,NeuRodin: A Two-stage Framework for High-Fidelity Neural Surface Reconstruction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94065,"Yifan Wang, Di Huang, Weicai Ye, Guofeng Zhang, Wanli Ouyang, Tong He","Signed Distance Function (SDF)-based volume rendering has demonstrated significant capabilities in surface reconstruction. Although promising, SDF-based methods often fail to capture detailed geometric structures, resulting in visible defects. By comparing SDF-based volume rendering to density-based volume rendering, we identify two main factors within the SDF-based approach that degrade surface quality: SDF-to-density representation and geometric regularization. These factors introduce challenges that hinder the optimization of the SDF field. To address these issues, we introduce NeuRodin, a novel two-stage neural surface reconstruction framework that not only achieves high-fidelity surface reconstruction but also retains the flexible optimization characteristics of density-based methods.   NeuRodin incorporates innovative strategies that facilitate transformation of arbitrary topologies and reduce artifacts associated with density bias.  Extensive evaluations on the Tanks and Temples and ScanNet++ datasets demonstrate the superiority of NeuRodin, showing strong reconstruction capabilities for both indoor and outdoor environments using solely posed RGB captures.

Poster,NeuroGauss4D-PCI: 4D Neural Fields and Gaussian Deformation Fields for Point Cloud Interpolation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95602,"Chaokang Jiang, Dalong Du, Jiuming Liu, Siting Zhu, Zhenqiang Liu, Zhuang Ma, Zhujin Liang, Jie Zhou","Point Cloud Interpolation confronts challenges from point sparsity, complex spatiotemporal dynamics, and the difficulty of deriving complete 3D point clouds from sparse temporal information. This paper presents NeuroGauss4D-PCI, which excels at modeling complex non-rigid deformations across varied dynamic scenes. The method begins with an iterative Gaussian cloud soft clustering module, offering structured temporal point cloud representations. The proposed temporal radial basis function Gaussian residual utilizes Gaussian parameter interpolation over time, enabling smooth parameter transitions and capturing temporal residuals of Gaussian distributions. Additionally, a 4D Gaussian deformation field tracks the evolution of these parameters, creating continuous spatiotemporal deformation fields. A 4D neural field transforms low-dimensional spatiotemporal coordinates ($x,y,z,t$) into a high-dimensional latent space. Finally, we adaptively and efficiently fuse the latent features from neural fields and the geometric features from Gaussian deformation fields.NeuroGauss4D-PCI outperforms existing methods in point cloud frame interpolation, delivering leading performance on both object-level (DHB) and large-scale autonomous driving datasets (NL-Drive), with scalability to auto-labeling and point cloud densification tasks."
Poster,Neuronal Competition Groups with Supervised STDP for Spike-Based Classification,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95890,"Gaspard Goupy, Pierre Tirilly, Ioan Marius Bilasco","Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) is a promising substitute to backpropagation for local training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware. STDP allows SNNs to address classification tasks by combining unsupervised STDP for feature extraction and supervised STDP for classification. Unsupervised STDP is usually employed with Winner-Takes-All (WTA) competition to learn distinct patterns. However, WTA for supervised STDP classification faces unbalanced competition challenges. In this paper, we propose a method to effectively implement WTA competition in a spiking classification layer employing first-spike coding and supervised STDP training. We introduce the Neuronal Competition Group (NCG), an architecture that improves classification capabilities by promoting the learning of various patterns per class. An NCG is a group of neurons mapped to a specific class, implementing intra-class WTA and a novel competition regulation mechanism based on two-compartment thresholds. We incorporate our proposed architecture into spiking classification layers trained with state-of-the-art supervised STDP rules. On top of two different unsupervised feature extractors, we obtain significant accuracy improvements on image recognition datasets such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. We show that our competition regulation mechanism is crucial for ensuring balanced competition and improved class separation."
Poster,Neuro-Symbolic Data Generation for Math Reasoning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96151,"Zenan Li, Zhi Zhou, Yuan Yao, Xian Zhang, Yu-Feng Li, Chun Cao, Fan Yang, Xiaoxing Ma","A critical question about Large Language Models (LLMs) is whether their apparent deficiency in mathematical reasoning is inherent, or merely a result of insufficient exposure to high-quality mathematical data. To explore this, we developed an automated method for generating high-quality, supervised mathematical datasets. The method carefully mutates existing math problems, ensuring both diversity and validity of the newly generated problems. This is achieved by a neuro-symbolic data generation framework combining the intuitive informalization strengths of LLMs, and the precise symbolic reasoning of math solvers along with projected Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling in the highly-irregular symbolic space.Empirical experiments demonstrate the high quality of data generated by the proposed method, and that the LLMs, specifically LLaMA-2 and Mistral, when realigned with the generated data, surpass their state-of-the-art counterparts."
Poster,Neuro-Vision to Language: Enhancing Brain Recording-based Visual Reconstruction and Language Interaction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93607,"Guobin Shen, Dongcheng Zhao, Xiang He, Linghao Feng, Yiting Dong, Jihang Wang, Qian Zhang, Yi Zeng","Decoding non-invasive brain recordings is pivotal for advancing our understanding of human cognition but faces challenges due to individual differences and complex neural signal representations. Traditional methods often require customized models and extensive trials, lacking interpretability in visual reconstruction tasks. Our framework integrates 3D brain structures with visual semantics using a *Vision Transformer 3D*. This unified feature extractor efficiently aligns fMRI features with multiple levels of visual embeddings, eliminating the need for subject-specific models and allowing extraction from single-trial data. The extractor consolidates multi-level visual features into one network, simplifying integration with Large Language Models (LLMs). Additionally, we have enhanced the fMRI dataset with diverse fMRI-image-related textual data to support multimodal large model development. Integrating with LLMs enhances decoding capabilities, enabling tasks such as brain captioning, complex reasoning, concept localization, and visual reconstruction. Our approach demonstrates superior performance across these tasks, precisely identifying language-based concepts within brain signals, enhancing interpretability, and providing deeper insights into neural processes. These advances significantly broaden the applicability of non-invasive brain decoding in neuroscience and human-computer interaction, setting the stage for advanced brain-computer interfaces and cognitive models."
Poster,Newswire: A Large-Scale Structured Database of a Century of Historical News,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97718,"Emily Silcock, Abhishek Arora, Luca D&#x27;Amico-Wong, Melissa Dell","In the U.S. historically, local newspapers drew their content largely from newswires like the Associated Press. Historians argue that newswires played a pivotal role in creating a national identity and shared understanding of the world, but there is no comprehensive archive of the content sent over newswires. We reconstruct such an archive by applying a customized deep learning pipeline to hundreds of terabytes of raw image scans from thousands of local newspapers. The resulting dataset contains 2.7 million unique public domain U.S. news wire articles, written between 1878 and 1977. Locations in these articles are georeferenced, topics are tagged using customized neural topic classification, named entities are recognized, and individuals are disambiguated to Wikipedia using a novel entity disambiguation model. To construct the Newswire dataset, we first recognize newspaper layouts and transcribe around 138 millions structured article texts from raw image scans. We then use a customized neural bi-encoder model to de-duplicate reproduced articles, in the presence of considerable abridgement and noise, quantifying how widely each article was reproduced. A text classifier is used to ensure that we only include newswire articles, which historically are in the public domain. The structured data that accompany the texts provide rich information about the who (disambiguated individuals), what (topics), and where (georeferencing) of the news that millions of Americans read over the course of a century. We also include Library of Congress metadata information about the newspapers that ran the articles on their front pages. The Newswire dataset is useful both for large language modeling - expanding training data beyond what is available from modern web texts - and for studying a diversity of questions in computational linguistics, social science, and the digital humanities."
Poster,NewTerm: Benchmarking Real-Time New Terms for Large Language Models with Annual Updates,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97724,"Hexuan Deng, Wenxiang Jiao, Xuebo Liu, Min Zhang, Zhaopeng Tu","Despite their remarkable abilities in various tasks, large language models (LLMs) still struggle with real-time information (e.g., new facts and terms) due to the knowledge cutoff in their development process. However, existing benchmarks focus on outdated content and limited fields, facing difficulties in real-time updating and leaving new terms unexplored. To address this problem, we propose an adaptive benchmark, NewTerm, for real-time evaluation of new terms. We design a highly automated construction method to ensure high-quality benchmark construction with minimal human effort, allowing flexible updates for real-time information. Empirical results on various LLMs demonstrate over 20% performance reduction caused by new terms. Additionally, while updates to the knowledge cutoff of LLMs can cover some of the new terms, they are unable to generalize to more distant new terms. We also analyze which types of terms are more challenging and why LLMs struggle with new terms, paving the way for future research. Finally, we construct NewTerm 2022 and 2023 to evaluate the new terms updated each year and will continue updating annually. The benchmark and codes can be found at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/NewTerms."
Poster,Newton Informed Neural Operator for Solving Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95997,"Wenrui Hao, Xinliang Liu, Yahong Yang","Solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) with multiple solutions is essential in various fields, including physics, biology, and engineering. However, traditional numerical methods, such as finite element and finite difference methods, often face challenges when dealing with nonlinear solvers, particularly in the presence of multiple solutions. These methods can become computationally expensive, especially when relying on solvers like Newton's method, which may struggle with ill-posedness near bifurcation points.In this paper, we propose a novel approach, the Newton Informed Neural Operator, which learns the Newton solver for nonlinear PDEs. Our method integrates traditional numerical techniques with the Newton nonlinear solver, efficiently learning the nonlinear mapping at each iteration. This approach allows us to compute multiple solutions in a single learning process while requiring fewer supervised data points than existing neural network methods."
Poster,Newton Losses: Using Curvature Information for Learning with Differentiable Algorithms,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93193,"Felix Petersen, Christian Borgelt, Tobias Sutter, Hilde Kuehne, Oliver Deussen, Stefano Ermon","When training neural networks with custom objectives, such as ranking losses and shortest-path losses, a common problem is that they are, per se, non-differentiable. A popular approach is to continuously relax the objectives to provide gradients, enabling learning. However, such differentiable relaxations are often non-convex and can exhibit vanishing and exploding gradients, making them (already in isolation) hard to optimize. Here, the loss function poses the bottleneck when training a deep neural network. We present Newton Losses, a method for improving the performance of existing hard to optimize losses by exploiting their second-order information via their empirical Fisher and Hessian matrices. Instead of training the neural network with second-order techniques, we only utilize the loss function's second-order information to replace it by a Newton Loss, while training the network with gradient descent.  This makes our method computationally efficient. We apply Newton Losses to eight differentiable algorithms for sorting and shortest-paths, achieving significant improvements for less-optimized differentiable algorithms, and consistent improvements, even for well-optimized differentiable algorithms."
