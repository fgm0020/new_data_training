Poster,IR-CM: The Fast and General-purpose Image Restoration Method Based on Consistency Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96807,"Xiaoxuan Gong, Jie Ma","This paper proposes a fast and general-purpose image restoration method. The key idea is to achieve few-step or even one-step inference by conducting consistency distilling or training on a specific mean-reverting stochastic differential equations. Furthermore, based on this, we propose a novel linear-nonlinear decoupling training strategy, significantly enhancing training effectiveness and surpassing consistency distillation on inference performance. This allows our method to be independent of any pre-trained checkpoint, enabling it to serve as an effective standalone image-to-image transformation model. Finally, to avoid trivial solutions and stabilize model training, we introduce a simple origin-guided loss. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conducted experiments on tasks including image deraining, denoising, deblurring, and low-light image enhancement. The experiments show that our method achieves highly competitive results with only one-step inference. And with just two-step inference, it can achieve state-of-the-art performance in low-light image enhancement. Furthermore, a number of ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed training strategy. our code is available at https://github.com/XiaoxuanGong/IR-CM."
Poster,Is A Picture Worth A Thousand Words? Delving Into Spatial Reasoning for Vision Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94371,"Jiayu Wang, Yifei Ming, Zhenmei Shi, Vibhav Vineet, Xin Wang, Sharon Li, Neel Joshi","Large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks and domains. Despite this promise, spatial understanding and reasoning—a fundamental component of human cognition—remains under-explored. We propose SpatialEval, a novel benchmark that covers diverse aspects of spatial reasoning such as relationship understanding, navigation, and counting. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of competitive language and vision-language models. Our findings reveal several counter-intuitive insights that have been overlooked in the literature: (1) Spatial reasoning poses significant challenges where competitive models can fall behind random guessing; (2) Despite additional visual input, VLMs often under-perform compared to their LLM counterparts; (3) When both textual and visual information is available, multi-modal language models become less reliant on visual information if sufficient textual clues are provided. Additionally, we demonstrate that leveraging redundancy between vision and text can significantly enhance model performance. We hope our study will inform the development of multimodal models to improve spatial intelligence and further close the gap with human intelligence.

Poster,Is Behavior Cloning All You Need? Understanding Horizon in Imitation Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96376,"Dylan J Foster, Adam Block, Dipendra Misra","Imitation learning (IL) aims to mimic the behavior of an expert in a sequential decision making task by learning from demonstrations, and has been widely applied to robotics, autonomous driving, and autoregressive text generation. The simplest approach to IL, behavior cloning (BC) is thought to incur sample complexity with unfavorable quadratic dependence on the problem horizon, motivating a variety of different online algorithms that attain improved linear horizon dependence under stronger assumptions on the data and the learner’s access to the expert. We revisit the apparent gap between offline and online IL from a learning-theoretic perspective, with a focus on general policy classes up to and including deep neural networks. Through a new analysis of BC with the logarithmic loss, we show that it is possible to achieve horizon-independent sample complexity in offline IL whenever (i) the range of the cumulative payoffs is controlled, and (ii) an appropriate notion of supervised learning complexity for the policy class is controlled. Specializing our results to deterministic, stationary policies, we show that the gap between offline and online IL is not fundamental: (i) it is possible to achieve linear dependence on horizon in offline IL under dense rewards (matching what was previously only known to be achievable in online IL); and (ii) without further assumptions on the policy class, online IL cannot improve over offline IL with the logarithmic loss, even in benign MDPs. We complement our theoretical results with experiments on standard RL tasks and autoregressive language generation to validate the practical relevance of our findings."
Poster,Is Cross-validation the Gold Standard to Estimate Out-of-sample Model Performance?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96639,"Garud Iyengar, Henry Lam, Tianyu Wang","Cross-Validation (CV) is the default choice for estimate the out-of-sample performance of machine learning models. Despite its wide usage, their statistical benefits have remained half-understood, especially in challenging nonparametric regimes. In this paper we fill in this gap and show that, in terms of estimating the out-of-sample performances, for a wide spectrum of models, CV does not statistically outperform the simple ``plug-in'' approach where one reuses training data for testing evaluation. Specifically, in terms of both the asymptotic bias and coverage accuracy of the associated interval for out-of-sample evaluation, $K$-fold CV provably cannot outperform plug-in regardless of the rate at which the parametric or nonparametric models converge. Leave-one-out CV can have a smaller bias as compared to plug-in; however, this bias improvement is negligible compared to the variability of the evaluation, and in some important cases leave-one-out again does not outperform plug-in once this variability is taken into account. We obtain our theoretical comparisons via a novel higher-order Taylor analysis that dissects the limit theorems of testing evaluations, which applies to model classes that are not amenable to previously known sufficient conditions. Our numerical results demonstrate that plug-in performs indeed no worse than CV in estimating model performance across a wide range of examples."
Poster,Is Function Similarity Over-Engineered? Building a Benchmark,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97742,"Rebecca Saul, Chang Liu, Noah Fleischmann, Richard Zak, Kristopher Micinski, Edward Raff, James Holt","Binary analysis is a core component of many critical security tasks, including reverse engineering, malware analysis, and vulnerability detection. Manual analysis is often time-consuming, but identifying commonly-used or previously-seen functions can reduce the time it takes to understand a new file. However, given the complexity of assembly, and the NP-hard nature of determining function equivalence, this task is extremely difficult. Common approaches often use sophisticated disassembly and decompilation tools, graph analysis, and other expensive pre-processing steps to perform function similarity searches over some corpus. In this work, we identify a number of discrepancies between the current research environment and the underlying application need. To remedy this, we build a new benchmark, REFuSe-Bench, for binary function similarity detection consisting of high-quality datasets and tests that better reflect real-world use cases. In doing so, we address issues like data duplication and accurate labeling, experiment with real malware, and perform the first serious evaluation of ML binary function similarity models on Windows data. Our benchmark reveals that a new, simple baseline — one which looks at only the raw bytes of a function, and requires no disassembly or other pre-processing --- is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in multiple settings. Our findings challenge conventional assumptions that complex models with highly-engineered features are being used to their full potential, and demonstrate that simpler approaches can provide significant value."
Poster,Is Knowledge Power? On the (Im)possibility of Learning from Strategic Interactions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96077,"Nivasini Ananthakrishnan, Nika Haghtalab, Chara Podimata, Kunhe Yang","When learning in strategic environments, a key question is whether agents can overcome uncertainty about their preferences to achieve outcomes they could have achieved absent any uncertainty. Can they do this solely through interactions with each other? We focus this question on the ability of agents to attain the value of their Stackelberg optimal strategy and study the impact of information asymmetry. We study repeated interactions in fully strategic environments where players' actions are decided based on learning algorithms that take into account their observed histories and knowledge of the game. We study the pure Nash equilibria (PNE) of a meta-game where players choose these algorithms as their actions. We demonstrate that if one player has perfect knowledge about the game, then any initial informational gap persists. That is, while there is always a PNE in which the informed agent achieves her Stackelberg value, there is a game where no PNE of the meta-game allows the partially informed player to achieve her Stackelberg value. On the other hand, if both players start with some uncertainty about the game, the quality of information alone does not determine which agent can achieve her Stackelberg value. In this case, the concept of information asymmetry becomes nuanced and depends on the game's structure. Overall, our findings suggest that repeated strategic interactions alone cannot facilitate learning effectively enough to earn an uninformed player her Stackelberg value."
Poster,Is Mamba Compatible with Trajectory Optimization in Offline Reinforcement Learning?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93011,"Yang Dai, Oubo Ma, Longfei Zhang, Xingxing Liang, Shengchao Hu, Mengzhu Wang, Shouling Ji, Jincai Huang, Li Shen","Transformer-based trajectory optimization methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in offline Reinforcement Learning (offline RL). Yet, it poses challenges due to substantial parameter size and limited scalability, which is particularly critical in sequential decision-making scenarios where resources are constrained such as in robots and drones with limited computational power. Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba (dubbed DeMa) in offline RL from the aspect of data structures and essential components with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements since DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify the hidden attention mechanism as a critical factor in its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous methods, outperforming Decision Transformer (DT) with higher performance while using 30\% fewer parameters in Atari, and exceeding DT with only a quarter of the parameters in MuJoCo."
Poster,Is Multiple Object Tracking a Matter of Specialization?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94523,"Gianluca Mancusi, Mattia Bernardi, Aniello Panariello, Angelo Porrello, Rita Cucchiara, SIMONE CALDERARA","End-to-end transformer-based trackers have achieved remarkable performance on most human-related datasets. However, training these trackers in heterogeneous scenarios poses significant challenges, including negative interference - where the model learns conflicting scene-specific parameters - and limited domain generalization, which often necessitates expensive fine-tuning to adapt the models to new domains. In response to these challenges, we introduce Parameter-efficient Scenario-specific Tracking Architecture (PASTA), a novel framework that combines Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Modular Deep Learning (MDL). Specifically, we define key scenario attributes (e.g, camera-viewpoint, lighting condition) and train specialized PEFT modules for each attribute. These expert modules are combined in parameter space, enabling systematic generalization to new domains without increasing inference time. Extensive experiments on MOTSynth, along with zero-shot evaluations on MOT17 and PersonPath22 demonstrate that a neural tracker built from carefully selected modules surpasses its monolithic counterpart. We release models and code."
Poster,Is O(log N) practical? Near-Equivalence Between Delay Robustness and Bounded Regret in Bandits and RL,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94060,"Enoch H. Kang, P. R. Kumar","Interactive decision making, encompassing bandits, contextual bandits, and reinforcement learning, has recently been of interest to theoretical studies of experimentation design and recommender system algorithm research. One recent finding in this area is that the well-known Graves-Lai constant being zero is a necessary and sufficient condition for achieving bounded (or constant) regret in interactive decision-making. As this condition may be a strong requirement for many applications, the practical usefulness of pursuing bounded regret has been questioned. In this paper, we show that the condition of the Graves-Lai constant being zero is also necessary for a consistent algorithm to achieve delay model robustness when reward delays are unknown (i.e., when feedback is anonymous). Here, model robustness is measured in terms of $\epsilon$-robustness, one of the most widely used and one of the least adversarial robustness concepts in the robust statistics literature. In particular, we show that $\epsilon$-robustness cannot be achieved for a consistent (i.e., uniformly sub-polynomial regret) algorithm, however small the nonzero $\epsilon$ value is, when the Grave-Lai constant is not zero. While this is a strongly negative result, we also provide a positive result for linear rewards models (contextual linear bandits, reinforcement learning with linear MDP) that the Grave-Lai constant being zero is also sufficient for achieving bounded regret without any knowledge of delay models, i.e., the best of both the efficiency world and the delay robustness world."
Poster,Is One GPU Enough? Pushing Image Generation at Higher-Resolutions with Foundation Models.,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95952,"Athanasios Tragakis, Marco Aversa, Chaitanya Kaul, Roderick Murray-Smith, Daniele Faccio","In this work, we introduce Pixelsmith, a zero-shot text-to-image generative framework to sample images at higher resolutions with a single GPU. We are the first to show that it is possible to scale the output of a pre-trained diffusion model by a factor of 1000, opening the road to gigapixel image generation at no extra cost. Our cascading method uses the image generated at the lowest resolution as baseline to sample at higher resolutions. For the guidance, we introduce the Slider, a mechanism that fuses the overall structure contained in the first-generated image with enhanced fine details. At each inference step, we denoise patches rather than the entire latent space, minimizing memory demands so that a single GPU can handle the process, regardless of the image's resolution. Our experimental results show that this method not only achieves higher quality and diversity compared to existing techniques but also reduces sampling time and ablation artifacts."
