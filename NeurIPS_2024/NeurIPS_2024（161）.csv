Poster,From News to Forecast: Integrating Event Analysis in LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting with Reflection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93316,"Xinlei Wang, Maike Feng, Jing Qiu, JINJIN GU, Junhua Zhao","This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative Agents to enhance time series forecasting by reasoning across both text and time series data. With language as a medium, our method adaptively integrates social events into forecasting models, aligning news content with time series fluctuations to provide richer insights. Specifically, we utilize LLM-based agents to iteratively filter out irrelevant news and employ human-like reasoning to evaluate predictions. This enables the model to analyze complex events, such as unexpected incidents and shifts in social behavior, and continuously refine the selection logic of news and the robustness of the agent's output. By integrating selected news events with time series data, we fine-tune a pre-trained LLM to predict sequences of digits in time series. The results demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in time series forecasting through the effective utilization of unstructured news data."
Poster,From Similarity to Superiority: Channel Clustering for Time Series Forecasting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95539,"Jialin Chen, Jan Eric Lenssen, Aosong Feng, Weihua Hu, Matthias Fey, Leandros Tassiulas, Jure Leskovec, Rex Ying","Time series forecasting has attracted significant attention in recent decades.    Previous studies have demonstrated that the Channel-Independent (CI) strategy improves forecasting performance by treating different channels individually, while it leads to poor generalization on unseen instances and ignores potentially necessary interactions between channels. Conversely, the Channel-Dependent (CD) strategy mixes all channels with even irrelevant and indiscriminate information, which, however, results in oversmoothing issues and limits forecasting accuracy.    There is a lack of channel strategy that effectively balances individual channel treatment for improved forecasting performance without overlooking essential interactions between channels. Motivated by our observation of a correlation between the time series model's performance boost against channel mixing and the intrinsic similarity on a pair of channels, we developed a novel and adaptable \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{C}lustering \textbf{M}odule (CCM). CCM dynamically groups channels characterized by intrinsic similarities and leverages cluster information instead of individual channel identities, combining the best of CD and CI worlds. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CCM can (1) boost the performance of CI and CD models by an average margin of 2.4% and 7.2% on long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively; (2) enable zero-shot forecasting with mainstream time series forecasting models; (3) uncover intrinsic time series patterns among channels and improve interpretability of complex time series models."
Poster,From Text to Trajectory: Exploring Complex Constraint Representation and Decomposition in Safe Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95538,"Pusen Dong, Tianchen Zhu, yue qiu, Haoyi Zhou, Jianxin Li","Safe reinforcement learning (RL) requires the agent to finish a given task while obeying specific constraints. Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments."
Poster,From Transparent to Opaque: Rethinking Neural Implicit Surfaces with $\alpha$-NeuS,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95283,"Haoran Zhang, Junkai Deng, Xuhui Chen, Fei Hou, Wencheng Wang, Hong Qin, Chen Qian, Ying He","Traditional 3D shape reconstruction techniques from multi-view images, such as structure from motion and multi-view stereo, face challenges in reconstructing transparent objects. Recent advances in neural radiance fields and its variants primarily address opaque or transparent objects, encountering difficulties to reconstruct both transparent and opaque objects simultaneously. This paper introduces $\alpha$-NeuS$\textemdash$an extension of NeuS$\textemdash$that proves NeuS is unbiased for materials from fully transparent to fully opaque. We find that transparent and opaque surfaces align with the non-negative local minima and the zero iso-surface, respectively, in the learned distance field of NeuS. Traditional iso-surfacing extraction algorithms, such as marching cubes, which rely on fixed iso-values, are ill-suited for such data. We develop a method to extract the transparent and opaque surface simultaneously based on DCUDF. To validate our approach, we construct a benchmark that includes both real-world and synthetic scenes, demonstrating its practical utility and effectiveness. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/728388808/alpha-NeuS."
Poster,From Trojan Horses to Castle Walls: Unveiling Bilateral Data Poisoning Effects in Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92999,"Zhuoshi Pan, Yuguang Yao, Gaowen Liu, Bingquan Shen, H. Vicky Zhao, Ramana Kompella, Sijia Liu","While state-of-the-art diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, concerns regarding their security persist. Earlier research highlighted DMs' vulnerability to data poisoning attacks, but these studies placed stricter requirements than conventional methods like 'BadNets' in image classification. This is because the art necessitates modifications to the diffusion training and sampling procedures. Unlike the prior work, we investigate whether BadNets-like data poisoning methods can directly degrade the generation by DMs. In other words, if only the training dataset is contaminated (without manipulating the diffusion process), how will this affect the performance of learned DMs? In this setting, we uncover bilateral data poisoning effects that not only serve an adversarial purpose (compromising the functionality of DMs) but also offer a defensive advantage (which can be leveraged for defense in classification tasks against poisoning attacks). We show that a BadNets-like data poisoning attack remains effective in DMs for producing incorrect images (misaligned with the intended text conditions). Meanwhile, poisoned DMs exhibit an increased ratio of triggers, a phenomenon we refer to as 'trigger amplification', among the generated images. This insight can be then used to enhance the detection of poisoned training data. In addition, even under a low poisoning ratio, studying the poisoning effects of DMs is also valuable for designing robust image classifiers against such attacks. Last but not least, we establish a meaningful linkage between data poisoning and the phenomenon of data replications by exploring DMs' inherent data memorization tendencies.

Poster,From Unstructured Data to In-Context Learning: Exploring What Tasks Can Be Learned and When,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93099,"Kevin Christian Wibisono, Yixin Wang","Large language models (LLMs) like transformers demonstrate impressive in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, allowing them to makepredictions for new tasks based on prompt exemplars without parameter updates. While existing ICL theories often assume structured training data resembling ICL tasks (e.g., x-y pairs for linear regression), LLMs are typically trained unsupervised on unstructured text, such as web content, which lacks clear parallels to tasks like word analogy. To address this gap, we examine what enables ICL in models trained on unstructured data, focusing on critical sequence model requirements and training data structure. We find that many ICL capabilities canemerge simply from co-occurrence of semantically related word pairs in unstructured data; word analogy completion, for example, can provably arise purely through co-occurrence modeling, using classical language models like continuous bag of words (CBOW), without needing positional information or attention mechanisms. However, positional information becomes crucial for logic reasoning tasks requiring generalization to unseen tokens. Finally, we identify two cases where ICL fails: one in logic reasoning tasks that require generalizing to new, unseen patterns, and another in analogy completion where relevant word pairs appear only in fixed training positions. These findings suggest that LLMs' ICL abilities depend heavily on the structural elements within their training data."
Poster,Frozen-DETR: Enhancing DETR with Image Understanding from Frozen Foundation Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94245,"Shenghao Fu, Junkai Yan, Qize Yang, Xihan Wei, Xiaohua Xie, Wei-Shi Zheng","Recent vision foundation models can extract universal representations and show impressive abilities in various tasks. However, their application on object detection is largely overlooked, especially without fine-tuning them. In this work, we show that frozen foundation models can be a versatile feature enhancer, even though they are not pre-trained for object detection. Specifically, we explore directly transferring the high-level image understanding of foundation models to detectors in the following two ways. First, the class token in foundation models provides an in-depth understanding of the complex scene, which facilitates decoding object queries in the detector's decoder by providing a compact context. Additionally, the patch tokens in foundation models can enrich the features in the detector's encoder by providing semantic details. Utilizing frozen foundation models as plug-and-play modules rather than the commonly used backbone can significantly enhance the detector's performance while preventing the problems caused by the architecture discrepancy between the detector's backbone and the foundation model. With such a novel paradigm, we boost the SOTA query-based detector DINO from 49.0% AP to 51.9% AP (+2.9% AP) and further to 53.8% AP (+4.8% AP)  by integrating one or two foundation models respectively, on the COCO validation set after training for 12 epochs with R50 as the detector's backbone. Code will be available."
Poster,Frustratingly Easy Test-Time Adaptation of Vision-Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94270,"Matteo Farina, Gianni Franchi, Giovanni Iacca, Massimiliano Mancini, Elisa Ricci","Vision-Language Models seamlessly discriminate among arbitrary semantic categories, yet they still suffer from poor generalization when presented with challenging examples. For this reason, Episodic Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques to adapt VLMs in the presence of a single unlabeled image. The recent literature on TTA is dominated by the paradigm of prompt tuning by Marginal Entropy Minimization, which, relying on online backpropagation, inevitably slows down inference while increasing memory. In this work, we theoretically investigate the properties of this approach and unveil that a surprisingly strong TTA method lies dormant and hidden within it. We term this approach ZERO (TTA with “zero” temperature), whose design is both incredibly effective and frustratingly simple: augment N times, predict, retain the most confident predictions, and marginalize after setting the Softmax temperature to zero. Remarkably, ZERO requires a single batched forward pass through the vision encoder only and no backward passes. We thoroughly evaluate our approach following the experimental protocol established in the literature and show that ZERO largely surpasses or compares favorably w.r.t. the state-of-the-art while being almost 10× faster and 13× more memory friendly than standard Test-Time Prompt Tuning. Thanks to its simplicity and comparatively negligible computation, ZERO can serve as a strong baseline for future work in this field. Code will be available."
Poster,FSP-Laplace: Function-Space Priors for the Laplace Approximation in Bayesian Deep Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96397,"Tristan Cinquin, Marvin Pförtner, Vincent Fortuin, Philipp Hennig, Robert Bamler","Laplace approximations are popular techniques for endowing deep networks with epistemic uncertainty estimates as they can be applied without altering the predictions of the trained network, and they scale to large models and datasets. While the choice of prior strongly affects the resulting posterior distribution, computational tractability and lack of interpretability of the weight space typically limit the Laplace approximation to isotropic Gaussian priors, which are known to cause pathological behavior as depth increases. As a remedy, we directly place a prior on function space. More precisely, since Lebesgue densities do not exist on infinite-dimensional function spaces, we recast training as finding the so-called weak mode of the posterior measure under a Gaussian process (GP) prior restricted to the space of functions representable by the neural network. Through the GP prior, one can express structured and interpretable inductive biases, such as regularity or periodicity, directly in function space, while still exploiting the implicit inductive biases that allow deep networks to generalize. After model linearization, the training objective induces a negative log-posterior density to which we apply a Laplace approximation, leveraging highly scalable methods from matrix-free linear algebra. Our method provides improved results where prior knowledge is abundant (as is the case in many scientific inference tasks). At the same time, it stays competitive for black-box supervised learning problems, where neural networks typically excel."
Poster,FT-AED: Benchmark Dataset for Early Freeway Traffic Anomalous Event Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97562,"Austin Coursey, Junyi Ji, Marcos Quinones Grueiro, William Barbour, Yuhang Zhang, Tyler Derr, Gautam Biswas, Daniel Work","Early and accurate detection of anomalous events on the freeway, such as accidents, can improve emergency response and clearance. However, existing delays and mistakes from manual crash reporting records make it a difficult problem to solve. Current large-scale freeway traffic datasets are not designed for anomaly detection and ignore these challenges. In this paper, we introduce the first large-scale lane-level freeway traffic dataset for anomaly detection. Our dataset consists of a month of weekday radar detection sensor data collected in 4 lanes along an 18-mile stretch of Interstate 24 heading toward Nashville, TN, comprising over 3.7 million sensor measurements. We also collect official crash reports from the Tennessee Department of Transportation Traffic Management Center and manually label all other potential anomalies in the dataset. To show the potential for our dataset to be used in future machine learning and traffic research, we benchmark numerous deep learning anomaly detection models on our dataset. We find that unsupervised graph neural network autoencoders are a promising solution for this problem and that ignoring spatial relationships leads to decreased performance. We demonstrate that our methods can reduce reporting delays by over 10 minutes on average while detecting 75% of crashes. Our dataset and all preprocessing code needed to get started are publicly released at https://vu.edu/ft-aed/ to facilitate future research."
