Poster,Gaussian Graph Network: Learning Efficient and Generalizable Gaussian Representations from Multi-view Images,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96803,"Shengjun Zhang, Xin Fei, Fangfu Liu, Haixu Song, Yueqi Duan","3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive novel view synthesis performance. While conventional methods require per-scene optimization, more recently several feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate pixel-aligned Gaussian representations with a learnable network, which are generalizable to different scenes. However, these methods simply combine pixel-aligned Gaussians from multiple views as scene representations, thereby leading to artifacts and extra memory cost without fully capturing the relations of Gaussians from different images. In this paper, we propose Gaussian Graph Network (GGN) to generate efficient and generalizable Gaussian representations. Specifically, we construct Gaussian Graphs to model the relations of Gaussian groups from different views. To support message passing at Gaussian level, we reformulate the basic graph operations over Gaussian representations, enabling each Gaussian to benefit from its connected Gaussian groups with Gaussian feature fusion. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian pooling layer to aggregate various Gaussian groups for efficient representations. We conduct experiments on the large-scale RealEstate10K and ACID datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our model uses fewer Gaussians and achieves better image quality with higher rendering speed."
Poster,GaussianMarker: Uncertainty-Aware Copyright Protection of 3D Gaussian Splatting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93139,"Xiufeng Huang, Ruiqi Li, Yiu-ming Cheung, Ka Chun Cheung, Simon See, Renjie Wan","3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a crucial method for acquiring 3D assets. To protect the copyright of these assets, digital watermarking techniques can be applied to embed ownership information discreetly within 3DGS mod- els. However, existing watermarking methods for meshes, point clouds, and implicit radiance fields cannot be directly applied to 3DGS models, as 3DGS models use explicit 3D Gaussians with distinct structures and do not rely on neural networks. Naively embedding the watermark on a pre-trained 3DGS can cause obvious distortion in rendered images. In our work, we propose an uncertainty- based method that constrains the perturbation of model parameters to achieve invisible watermarking for 3DGS. At the message decoding stage, the copyright messages can be reliably extracted from both 3D Gaussians and 2D rendered im- ages even under various forms of 3D and 2D distortions. We conduct extensive experiments on the Blender, LLFF, and MipNeRF-360 datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both message decoding accuracy and view synthesis quality."
Poster,Gaussian Process Bandits for Top-k Recommendations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96620,"Mohit Yadav, Cameron Musco, Daniel Sheldon","Algorithms that utilize bandit feedback to optimize top-k recommendations are vital for online marketplaces, search engines, and content platforms.  However, the combinatorial nature of this problem poses a significant challenge,  as the possible number of ordered top-k recommendations from $n$ items grows exponentially with $k$. As a result, previous work often relies on restrictive assumptions about the reward or bandit feedback models, such as assuming that the feedback discloses rewards for each recommended item rather than a single scalar feedback for the entire set of top-k recommendations. We introduce a novel contextual bandit algorithm for top-k recommendations, leveraging a Gaussian process with a Kendall kernel to model the reward function.Our algorithm requires only scalar feedback from the top-k recommendations and does not impose restrictive assumptions on the reward structure. Theoretical analysis confirms that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret in relation to the number of rounds and arms. Additionally, empirical results using a bandit simulator demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other baselines across various scenarios."
Poster,GAVEL: Generating Games via Evolution and Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93639,"Graham Todd, Alexander G Padula, Matthew Stephenson, Eric Piette, Dennis Soemers, Julian Togelius","Automatically generating novel and interesting games is a complex task. Challenges include representing game rules in a computationally workable form, searching through the large space of potential games under most such representations, and accurately evaluating the originality and quality of previously unseen games. Prior work in automated game generation has largely focused on relatively restricted rule representations and relied on domain-specific heuristics. In this work, we explore the generation of novel games in the comparatively expansive Ludii game description language, which encodes the rules of over 1000 board games in a variety of styles and modes of play. We draw inspiration from recent advances in large language models and evolutionary computation in order to train a model that intelligently mutates and recombines games and mechanics expressed as code. We demonstrate both quantitatively and qualitatively that our approach is capable of generating new and interesting games, including in regions of the potential rules space not covered by existing games in the Ludii dataset."
Poster,GC-Bench: An Open and Unified Benchmark for Graph Condensation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97681,"Qingyun Sun, Ziying Chen, Beining Yang, Cheng Ji, Xingcheng Fu, Sheng Zhou, Hao Peng, Jianxin Li, Philip S Yu","Graph condensation (GC) has recently garnered considerable attention due to its ability to reduce large-scale graph datasets while preserving their essential properties. The core concept of GC is to create a smaller, more manageable graph that retains the characteristics of the original graph. Despite the proliferation of graph condensation methods developed in recent years, there is no comprehensive evaluation and in-depth analysis, which creates a great obstacle to understanding the progress in this field. To fill this gap, we develop a comprehensive Graph Condensation Benchmark (GC-Bench) to analyze the performance of graph condensation in different scenarios systematically. Specifically, GC-Bench systematically investigates the characteristics of graph condensation in terms of the following dimensions: effectiveness, transferability, and complexity. We comprehensively evaluate 12 state-of-the-art graph condensation algorithms in node-level and graph-level tasks and analyze their performance in 12 diverse graph datasets. Further, we have developed an easy-to-use library for training and evaluating different GC methods to facilitate reproducible research.The GC-Bench library is available at https://github.com/RingBDStack/GC-Bench."
Poster,"GDeR: Safeguarding Efficiency, Balancing, and Robustness via Prototypical Graph Pruning",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95389,"Guibin Zhang, Haonan Dong, yuchen zhang, Zhixun Li, Dingshuo Chen, Kai Wang, Tianlong Chen, Yuxuan Liang, Dawei Cheng, Kun Wang","Training high-quality deep models necessitates vast amounts of data, resulting in overwhelming computational and memory demands. Recently, data pruning, distillation, and coreset selection have been developed to streamline data volume by \textit{retaining}, \textit{synthesizing}, or \textit{selecting} a small yet informative subset from the full set. Among these methods, data pruning incurs the least additional training cost and offers the most practical acceleration benefits. However, it is the most vulnerable, often suffering significant performance degradation with imbalanced or biased data schema, thus raising concerns about its accuracy and reliability in on-device deployment. Therefore, there is a looming need for a new data pruning paradigm that maintains the efficiency of previous practices while ensuring balance and robustness.Unlike the fields of computer vision and natural language processing, where mature solutions have been developed to address these issues, graph neural networks (GNNs) continue to struggle with increasingly large-scale, imbalanced, and noisy datasets, lacking a unified dataset pruning solution. To achieve this, we introduce a novel dynamic soft-pruning method, \ourmethod, designed to update the training ``basket'' during the process using trainable prototypes. \ourmethod first constructs a well-modeled graph embedding hypersphere and then samples \textit{representative, balanced, and unbiased subsets} from this embedding space, which achieves the goal we called {\fontfamily{lmtt}\selectfont \textbf{Graph Training Debugging}}.Extensive experiments on four datasets across three GNN backbones, demonstrate that \ourmethod (I) achieves or surpasses the performance of the full dataset with $30\%\sim50\%$ fewer training samples, (II) attains up to a $2.81\times$ lossless training speedup, and (III) outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods in imbalanced training and noisy training scenarios by $0.3\%\sim4.3\%$ and $3.6\%\sim7.8\%$, respectively."
Poster,GenAI Arena: An Open Evaluation Platform for Generative Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97878,"Dongfu Jiang, Max KU, Tianle Li, Yuansheng Ni, Shizhuo Sun, Rongqi Fan, Wenhu Chen","Generative AI has made remarkable strides to revolutionize fields such as image and video generation. These advancements are driven by innovative algorithms, architecture, and data. However, the rapid proliferation of generative models has highlighted a critical gap: the absence of trustworthy evaluation metrics. Current automatic assessments such as FID, CLIP, FVD, etc often fail to capture the nuanced quality and user satisfaction associated with generative outputs. This paper proposes an open platform GenAI-Arena to evaluate different image and video generative models, where users can actively participate in evaluating these models. By leveraging collective user feedback and votes, GenAI-Arena aims to provide a more democratic and accurate measure of model performance. It covers three tasks of text-to-image generation, text-to-video generation, and image editing respectively. Currently, we cover a total of 35 open-source generative models. GenAI-Arena has been operating for seven months, amassing over 9000 votes from the community. We describe our platform, analyze the data, and explain the statistical methods for ranking the models. To further promote the research in building model-based evaluation metrics, we release a cleaned version of our preference data for the three tasks, namely GenAI-Bench. We prompt the existing multi-modal models like Gemini, and GPT-4o to mimic human voting. We compute the accuracy by comparing the model voting with the human voting to understand their judging abilities. Our results show existing multimodal models are still lagging in assessing the generated visual content, even the best model GPT-4o only achieves an average accuracy of $49.19\%$ across the three generative tasks. Open-source MLLMs perform even worse due to the lack of instruction-following and reasoning ability in complex vision scenarios."
Poster,GenArtist: Multimodal LLM as an Agent for Unified Image Generation and Editing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94941,"Zhenyu Wang, Aoxue Li, Zhenguo Li, Xihui Liu","Despite the success achieved by existing image generation and editing methods, current models still struggle with complex problems including intricate text prompts, and the absence of  verification and self-correction mechanisms makes the generated images unreliable. Meanwhile, a single model tends to specialize in particular tasks and possess the corresponding capabilities, making it inadequate for fulfilling all user requirements. We propose GenArtist, a unified image generation and editing system, coordinated by a multimodal large language model (MLLM) agent. We integrate a comprehensive range of existing models into the tool library and utilize the agent for tool selection and execution. For a complex problem, the MLLM agent decomposes it into simpler sub-problems and constructs a tree structure to systematically plan the procedure of generation, editing, and self-correction with step-by-step verification. By automatically generating missing position-related inputs and incorporating position information, the appropriate tool can be effectively employed to address each sub-problem. Experiments demonstrate that GenArtist can perform various generation and editing tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance and surpassing existing models such as SDXL and DALL-E 3, as can be seen in Fig. 1. We will open-source the code for future research and applications."
Poster,Gene-Gene Relationship Modeling Based on Genetic Evidence for Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data Imputation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94136,"Daeho Um, Ji Won Yoon, Seong Jin Ahn, Yunha Yeo","Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enable the exploration of cellular heterogeneity and facilitate the construction of cell atlases. However, scRNA-seq data often contain a large portion of missing values (false zeros) or noisy values, hindering downstream analyses. To recover these false zeros, propagation-based imputation methods have been proposed using $k$-NN graphs. However they model only associating relationships among genes within a cell, while, according to well-known genetic evidence, there are both associating and dissociating relationships among genes. To apply this genetic evidence to gene-gene relationship modeling, this paper proposes a novel imputation method that newly employs dissociating relationships in addition to associating relationships. Our method constructs a $k$-NN graph to additionally model dissociating relationships via the negation of a given cell-gene matrix. Moreover, our method standardizes the value distribution (mean and variance) of each gene to have standard distributions regardless of the gene. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves exceptional performance gains over state-of-the-art methods in both cell clustering and gene expression recovery across six scRNA-seq datasets, validating the significance of using complete gene-gene relationships in accordance with genetic evidence.

Poster,General Articulated Objects Manipulation in Real Images via Part-Aware Diffusion Process,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94831,"ZHOU FANG, Yong-Lu Li, Lixin Yang, Cewu Lu","Articulated object manipulation in real images is a fundamental step in computer and robotic vision tasks. Recently, several image editing methods based on diffusion models have been proposed to manipulate articulated objects according to text prompts. However, these methods often generate weird artifacts or even fail in real images. To this end, we introduce the Part-Aware Diffusion Model to approach the manipulation of articulated objects in real images. First, we develop Abstract 3D Models to represent and manipulate articulated objects efficiently. Then we propose dynamic feature maps to transfer the appearance of objects from input images to edited ones, meanwhile generating the novel-appearing parts reasonably. Extensive experiments are provided to illustrate the advanced manipulation capabilities of our method concerning state-of-the-art editing works. Additionally, we verify our method on 3D articulated object understanding forembodied robot scenarios and the promising results prove that our method supports this task strongly.
