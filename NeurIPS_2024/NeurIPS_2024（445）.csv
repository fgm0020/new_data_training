Poster,Web-Scale Visual Entity Recognition: An LLM-Driven Data Approach,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94878,"Mathilde Caron, Alireza Fathi, Cordelia Schmid, Ahmet Iscen","Web-scale visual entity recognition, the task of associating images with their corresponding entities within vast knowledge bases like Wikipedia, presents significant challenges due to the lack of clean, large-scale training data. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to curate such a dataset, leveraging a multimodal large language model (LLM) for label verification, metadata generation, and rationale explanation. Instead of relying on the multimodal LLM to directly annotate data, which we found to be suboptimal, we prompt it to reason about potential candidate entity labels by accessing additional contextually relevant information (such as Wikipedia), resulting in more accurate annotations. We further use the multimodal LLM to enrich the dataset by generating question-answer pairs and a grounded fine-grained textual description (referred to as ""rationale"") that explains the connection between images and their assigned entities. Experiments demonstrate that models trained on this automatically curated data achieve state-of-the-art performance on web-scale visual entity recognition tasks (e.g. +6.9% improvement in OVEN entity task), underscoring the importance of high-quality training data in this domain."
Poster,WebUOT-1M: Advancing Deep Underwater Object Tracking with A Million-Scale Benchmark,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97605,"Chunhui Zhang, Li Liu, Guanjie Huang, Hao Wen, XI ZHOU, Yanfeng Wang","Underwater Object Tracking (UOT) is essential for identifying and tracking submerged objects in underwater videos, but existing datasets are limited in scale, diversity of target categories and scenarios covered, impeding the development of advanced tracking algorithms. To bridge this gap, we take the first step and introduce WebUOT-1M, \ie, the largest public UOT benchmark to date, sourced from complex and realistic underwater environments. It comprises 1.1 million frames across 1,500 video clips filtered from 408 target categories, largely surpassing previous UOT datasets, \eg, UVOT400. Through meticulous manual annotation and verification, we provide high-quality bounding boxes for underwater targets. Additionally, WebUOT-1M includes language prompts for video sequences, expanding its application areas, \eg, underwater vision-language tracking. Given that most existing trackers are designed for open-air conditions and perform poorly in underwater environments due to domain gaps, we propose a novel framework that uses omni-knowledge distillation to train a student Transformer model effectively. To the best of our knowledge, this framework is the first to effectively transfer open-air domain knowledge to the UOT model through knowledge distillation, as demonstrated by results on both existing UOT datasets and the newly proposed WebUOT-1M. We have thoroughly tested WebUOT-1M with 30 deep trackers, showcasing its potential as a benchmark for future UOT research. The complete dataset, along with codes and tracking results, are publicly accessible at \href{https://github.com/983632847/Awesome-Multimodal-Object-Tracking}{\color{magenta}{here}}."
Poster,Weight decay induces low-rank attention layers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93637,"Seijin Kobayashi, Yassir Akram, Johannes von Oswald","The effect of regularizers such as weight decay when training deep neural networks is not well understood. We study the influence of weight decay as well as $L2$-regularization when training neural network models in which parameter matrices interact multiplicatively. This combination is of particular interest as this parametrization is common in attention layers, the workhorse of transformers. Here, key-query, as well as value-projection parameter matrices, are multiplied directly with each other: $W_K^TW_Q$ and $PW_V$. We extend previous results and show on one hand that any local minimum of a $L2$-regularized loss of the form $L(AB^\top) + \lambda (\|A\|^2 + \|B\|^2)$ coincides with a minimum of the nuclear norm-regularized loss $L(AB^\top) + \lambda\|AB^\top\|_*$, and on the other hand that the 2 losses become identical exponentially quickly during training. We thus complement existing works linking $L2$-regularization with low-rank regularization, and in particular, explain why such regularization on the matrix product affects early stages of training.Based on these theoretical insights, we verify empirically that the key-query and value-projection matrix products $W_K^TW_Q, PW_V$ within attention layers, when optimized with weight decay, as usually done in vision tasks and language modelling, indeed induce a significant reduction in the rank of $W_K^TW_Q$ and $PW_V$, even in fully online training.We find that, in accordance with existing work, inducing low rank in attention matrix products can damage language model performance, and observe advantages when decoupling weight decay in attention layers from the rest of the parameters."
Poster,Weight Diffusion for Future: Learn to Generalize in Non-Stationary Environments,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96806,"Mixue Xie, Shuang Li, Binhui Xie, Chi Liu, Jian Liang, Zixun Sun, Ke Feng, Chengwei Zhu","Enabling deep models to generalize in non-stationary environments is vital for real-world machine learning, as data distributions are often found to continually change. Recently, evolving domain generalization (EDG) has emerged to tackle the domain generalization in a time-varying system, where the domain gradually evolves over time in an underlying continuous structure. Nevertheless, it typically assumes multiple source domains simultaneously ready. It still remains an open problem to address EDG in the domain-incremental setting, where source domains are non-static and arrive sequentially to mimic the evolution of training domains. To this end, we propose Weight Diffusion (W-Diff), a novel framework that utilizes the conditional diffusion model in the parameter space to learn the evolving pattern of classifiers during the domain-incremental training process. Specifically, the diffusion model is conditioned on the classifier weights of different historical domain (regarded as a reference point) and the prototypes of current domain, to learn the evolution from the reference point to the classifier weights of current domain (regarded as the anchor point). In addition, a domain-shared feature encoder is learned by enforcing prediction consistency among multiple classifiers, so as to mitigate the overfitting problem and restrict the evolving pattern to be reflected in the classifier as much as possible. During inference, we adopt the ensemble manner based on a great number of target domain-customized classifiers, which are cheaply obtained via the conditional diffusion model, for robust prediction. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show the superior generalization performance of W-Diff on unseen domains in the future."
Poster,Weight for Robustness: A Comprehensive Approach towards Optimal Fault-Tolerant Asynchronous ML,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93233,"Tehila Dahan, Kfir Y. Levy","We address the challenges of Byzantine-robust training in asynchronous distributed machine learning systems, aiming to enhance efficiency amid massive parallelization and heterogeneous compute resources. Asynchronous systems, marked by independently operating workers and intermittent updates, uniquely struggle with maintaining integrity against Byzantine failures, which encompass malicious or erroneous actions that disrupt learning. The inherent delays in such settings not only introduce additional bias to the system but also obscure the disruptions caused by Byzantine faults. To tackle these issues, we adapt the Byzantine framework to asynchronous dynamics by introducing a novel weighted robust aggregation framework. This allows for the extension of robust aggregators and a recent meta-aggregator to their weighted versions, mitigating the effects of delayed updates. By further incorporating a recent variance-reduction technique, we achieve an optimal convergence rate for the first time in an asynchronous Byzantine environment. Our methodology is rigorously validated through empirical and theoretical analysis, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing fault tolerance and optimizing performance in asynchronous ML systems."
Poster,WeiPer: OOD Detection using Weight Perturbations of Class Projections,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96381,"Maximilian Granz, Manuel Heurich, Tim Landgraf","Recent advances in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection on image data show that pre-trained neural network classifiers can separate in-distribution (ID) from OOD data well, leveraging the class-discriminative ability of the model itself. Methods have been proposed that either use logit information directly or that process the model's penultimate layer activations. With ""WeiPer"", we introduce perturbations of the class projections in the final fully connected layer which creates a richer representation of the input. We show that this simple trick can improve the OOD detection performance of a variety of methods and additionally propose a distance-based method that leverages the properties of the augmented WeiPer space. We achieve state-of-the-art OOD detection results across multiple benchmarks of the OpenOOD framework, especially pronounced in difficult settings in which OOD samples are positioned close to the training set distribution. We support our findings with theoretical motivations and empirical observations, and run extensive ablations to provide insights into why WeiPer works. Our code is available at: https://github.com/mgranz/weiper."
Poster,Weisfeiler and Leman Go Loopy: A New Hierarchy for Graph Representational Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96314,"Raffaele Paolino, Sohir Maskey, Pascal Welke, Gitta Kutyniok","We introduce $r$-loopy Weisfeiler-Leman ($r$-$\ell$WL), a novel hierarchy of graph isomorphism tests and a corresponding GNN framework, $r$-$\ell$MPNN, that can count cycles up to length $r{+}2$. Most notably, we show that $r$-$\ell$WL can count homomorphisms of cactus graphs. This extends 1-WL, which can only count homomorphisms of trees and, in fact, is incomparable to $k$-WL for any fixed $k$. We empirically validate the expressive and counting power of $r$-$\ell$MPNN on several synthetic datasets and demonstrate the scalability and strong performance on various real-world datasets, particularly on sparse graphs."
Poster,WelQrate: Defining the Gold Standard in Small Molecule Drug Discovery Benchmarking,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97684,"Yunchao Liu, Ha Dong, Xin Wang, Rocco Moretti, Yu Wang, Zhaoqian Su, Jiawei Gu, Bobby Bodenheimer, Charles Weaver, Jens Meiler, Tyler Derr","While deep learning has revolutionized computer-aided drug discovery, the AI community has predominantly focused on model innovation and placed less emphasis on establishing best benchmarking practices. We posit that without a sound model evaluation framework, the AI community's efforts cannot reach their full potential, thereby slowing the progress and transfer of innovation into real-world drug discovery.Thus, in this paper, we seek to establish a new gold standard for small molecule drug discovery benchmarking, *WelQrate*. Specifically, our contributions are threefold: ***WelQrate*** **dataset collection** - we introduce a meticulously curated collection of 9 datasets spanning 5 therapeutic target classes. Our hierarchical curation pipelines, designed by drug discovery experts, go beyond the primary high-throughput screen by leveraging additional confirmatory and counter screens along with rigorous domain-driven preprocessing, such as Pan-Assay Interference Compounds (PAINS) filtering, to ensure the high-quality data in the datasets; ***WelQrate*** **Evaluation Framework** - we propose a standardized model evaluation framework considering high-quality datasets, featurization, 3D conformation generation, evaluation metrics, and data splits, which provides a reliable benchmarking for drug discovery experts conducting real-world virtual screening; **Benchmarking** - we evaluate model performance through various research questions using the *WelQrate* dataset collection, exploring the effects of different models, dataset quality, featurization methods, and data splitting strategies on the results.In summary, we recommend adopting our proposed *WelQrate* as the gold standard in small molecule drug discovery benchmarking. The *WelQrate* dataset collection, along with the curation codes, and experimental scripts are all publicly available at www.WelQrate.org."
Poster,WenMind: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Chinese Classical Literature and Language Arts,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97880,"Jiahuan Cao, Yang Liu, Yongxin Shi, Kai Ding, Lianwen Jin","Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advancements across numerous domains, but their capabilities in Chinese Classical Literature and Language Arts (CCLLA) remain largely unexplored due to the limited scope and tasks of existing benchmarks. To fill this gap, we propose WenMind, a comprehensive benchmark dedicated for evaluating LLMs in CCLLA. WenMind covers the sub-domains of Ancient Prose, Ancient Poetry, and Ancient Literary Culture, comprising 4,875 question-answer pairs, spanning 42 fine-grained tasks, 3 question formats, and 2 evaluation scenarios: domain-oriented and capability-oriented. Based on WenMind, we conduct a thorough evaluation of 31 representative LLMs, including general-purpose models and ancient Chinese LLMs. The results reveal that even the best-performing model, ERNIE-4.0, only achieves a total score of 64.3, indicating significant room for improvement of LLMs in the CCLLA domain. We also provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different LLMs and highlight the importance of pre-training data in achieving better results.Overall, WenMind serves as a standardized and comprehensive baseline, providing valuable insights for future CCLLA research. Our benchmark and related code are available at \url{https://github.com/SCUT-DLVCLab/WenMind}."
Poster,WFCRL: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Benchmark for Wind Farm Control,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97630,"Claire Bizon Monroc, Ana Busic, Donatien Dubuc, Jiamin Zhu","The wind farm control problem is challenging, since conventional model-based control strategies require tractable models of complex aerodynamical interactions between the turbines and suffer from the curse of dimension when the number of turbines increases. Recently, model-free and multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches have been used to address this challenge. In this article, we introduce WFCRL (Wind Farm Control with Reinforcement Learning), the first suite of multi-agent reinforcement learning environments for the wind farm control problem. WFCRL frames a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem: each turbine is an agent and can learn to adjust its yaw, pitch or torque to maximize the common objective (e.g. the total power production of the farm). WFCRL also offers turbine load observations that will allow to optimize the farm performance while limiting turbine structural damages. Interfaces with two state-of-the-art farm simulators are implemented in WFCRL: a static simulator (Floris) and a dynamic simulator (FAST.farm). For each simulator, $10$ wind layouts are provided, including $5$ real wind farms. Two state-of-the-art online MARL algorithms are implemented to illustrate the scaling challenges. As learning online on FAST.Farm is highly time-consuming, WFCRL offers the possibility of designing transfer learning strategies from Floris to FAST.Farm."
