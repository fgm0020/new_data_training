Poster,Chat-Scene: Bridging 3D Scene and Large Language Models with Object Identifiers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93362,"Haifeng Huang, Yilun Chen, Zehan Wang, Rongjie Huang, Runsen Xu, Tai WANG, Luping Liu, Xize Cheng, Yang Zhao, Jiangmiao Pang, Zhou Zhao","Recent advancements in 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities for 3D scene understanding. However, previous methods exhibit deficiencies in general referencing and grounding capabilities for intricate scene comprehension. In this paper, we introduce the use of object identifiers and object-centric representations to interact with scenes at the object level. Specifically, we decompose the input 3D scene into a set of object proposals, each assigned a unique identifier token, which enables efficient object referencing and grounding during user-assistant interactions. Given the scarcity of scene-language data, we model the scene embeddings as a sequence of explicit object-level embeddings, derived from semantic-rich 2D or 3D representations. By employing object identifiers, we transform diverse 3D scene-language tasks into a unified question-answering format, facilitating joint training without the need for additional task-specific heads. With minimal fine-tuning on all downstream tasks, our model significantly outperforms existing methods on benchmarks including ScanRefer, Multi3DRefer, Scan2Cap, ScanQA, and SQA3D."
Poster,ChatTracker: Enhancing Visual Tracking Performance via Chatting with Multimodal Large Language Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95794,"Yiming Sun, Fan Yu, Shaoxiang Chen, Yu Zhang, Junwei Huang, Yang Li, Chenhui Li, Changbo Wang","Visual object tracking aims to locate a targeted object in a video sequence based on an initial bounding box. Recently, Vision-Language~(VL) trackers have proposed to utilize additional natural language descriptions to enhance versatility in various applications. However, VL trackers are still inferior to State-of-The-Art (SoTA) visual trackers in terms of tracking performance. We found that this inferiority primarily results from their heavy reliance on manual textual annotations, which include the frequent provision of ambiguous language descriptions. In this paper, we propose ChatTracker to leverage the wealth of world knowledge in the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate high-quality language descriptions and enhance tracking performance. To this end, we propose a novel reflection-based prompt optimization module to iteratively refine the ambiguous and inaccurate descriptions of the target with tracking feedback. To further utilize semantic information produced by MLLM, a simple yet effective VL tracking framework is proposed and can be easily integrated as a plug-and-play module to boost the performance of both VL and visual trackers. Experimental results show that our proposed ChatTracker achieves a performance comparable to existing methods."
Poster,Cherry on Top: Parameter Heterogeneity and Quantization in Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95258,"Wanyun Cui, Qianle Wang","This paper reveals the phenomenon of parameter heterogeneity in large language models (LLMs). We find that a small subset of ``cherry'' parameters exhibit a disproportionately large influence on model performance, while the vast majority of parameters have minimal impact. This heterogeneity is found to be prevalent across different model families, scales, and types. Motivated by this observation, we propose CherryQ, a novel quantization method that unifies the optimization of mixed-precision parameters. CherryQ identifies and preserves the critical cherry parameters in high precision while aggressively quantizing the remaining parameters to low precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CherryQ. CherryQ outperforms existing quantization approaches in terms of perplexity and downstream task performance. Notably, our 3-bit quantized Vicuna-1.5 exhibits competitive performance compared to their 16-bit counterparts. These findings highlight the potential of CherryQ for enabling efficient deployment of LLMs by taking advantage of parameter heterogeneity."
Poster,Chimera: Effectively Modeling Multivariate Time Series with 2-Dimensional State Space Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93680,"Ali Behrouz, Michele Santacatterina, Ramin Zabih","Modeling multivariate time series is a well-established problem with a wide range of applications from healthcare to financial markets. It, however, is challenging as it requires methods to (1) have high expressive power of representing complicated dependencies along the time axis to capture both long-term progression and seasonal patterns, (2) capture the inter-variate dependencies when it is informative, (3) dynamically model the dependencies of variate and time dimensions, and (4) have efficient training and inference for very long sequences. Traditional State Space Models (SSMs) are classical approaches for univariate time series modeling due to their simplicity and expressive power to represent linear dependencies. They, however, have fundamentally limited expressive power to capture non-linear dependencies, are slow in practice, and fail to model the inter-variate information flow. Despite recent attempts to improve the expressive power of SSMs by using deep structured SSMs, the existing methods are either limited to univariate time series, fail to model complex patterns (e.g., seasonal patterns), fail to dynamically model the dependencies of variate and time dimensions, and/or are input-independent.  We present Chimera, an expressive variation of the 2-dimensional SSMs with careful design of parameters to maintain high expressive power while keeping the training complexity linear. Using two SSM heads with different discretization processes and input-dependent parameters, Chimera is provably able to learn long-term progression, seasonal patterns, and desirable dynamic autoregressive processes. To improve the efficiency of complex 2D recurrence, we present a fast training using a new 2-dimensional parallel selective scan. Our experimental evaluation shows the superior performance of Chimera on extensive and diverse benchmarks, including ECG and speech time series classification, long-term and short-term time series forecasting, and time series anomaly detection."
Poster,ChronoEpilogi: Scalable Time Series Selection with Multiple Solutions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93042,"Etienne Vareille, Michele Linardi, Ioannis Tsamardinos, Vassilis Christophides","We consider the problem of selecting all the minimal-size subsets of multivariate time-series (TS) variables whose past leads to an optimal predictive model for the future (forecasting) of a given target variable (multiple feature selection problem for times-series). Identifying these subsets leads to gaining insights, domain intuition,and a better understanding of the data-generating mechanism; it is often the first step in causal modeling. While identifying a single solution to the feature selection problem suffices for forecasting purposes, identifying all such minimal-size, optimally predictive subsets is necessary for knowledge discovery and important to avoid misleading a practitioner. We develop the theory of multiple feature selection for time-series data, propose the ChronoEpilogi algorithm, and prove its soundness and completeness under two mild, broad, non-parametric distributional assumptions, namely Compositionality of the distribution and Interchangeability of time-series variables in solutions. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the scalability of ChronoEpilogi to hundreds of TS variables and its efficacy in identifying multiple solutions. In the real datasets, ChronoEpilogi is shown to reduce the number of TS variables by 96% (on average) by conserving or even improving forecasting performance. Furthermore, it is on par with GroupLasso performance, with the added benefit of providing multiple solutions."
Poster,ChronoMagic-Bench: A Benchmark for Metamorphic Evaluation of Text-to-Time-lapse Video Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97648,"Shenghai Yuan, Jinfa Huang, Yongqi Xu, YaoYang Liu, Shaofeng Zhang, Yujun Shi, Rui-Jie Zhu, Xinhua Cheng, Jiebo Luo, Li Yuan","We propose a novel text-to-video (T2V) generation benchmark, *ChronoMagic-Bench*, to evaluate the temporal and metamorphic knowledge skills in time-lapse video generation of the T2V models (e.g. Sora and Lumiere). Compared to existing benchmarks that focus on visual quality and text relevance of generated videos, *ChronoMagic-Bench* focuses on the models’ ability to generate time-lapse videos with significant metamorphic amplitude and temporal coherence. The benchmark probes T2V models for their physics, biology, and chemistry capabilities, in a free-form text control. For these purposes, *ChronoMagic-Bench* introduces **1,649** prompts and real-world videos as references, categorized into four major types of time-lapse videos: biological, human creation, meteorological, and physical phenomena, which are further divided into 75 subcategories. This categorization ensures a comprehensive evaluation of the models’ capacity to handle diverse and complex transformations. To accurately align human preference on the benchmark, we introduce two new automatic metrics, MTScore and CHScore, to evaluate the videos' metamorphic attributes and temporal coherence. MTScore measures the metamorphic amplitude, reflecting the degree of change over time, while CHScore assesses the temporal coherence, ensuring the generated videos maintain logical progression and continuity. Based on the *ChronoMagic-Bench*, we conduct comprehensive manual evaluations of eighteen representative T2V models, revealing their strengths and weaknesses across different categories of prompts, providing a thorough evaluation framework that addresses current gaps in video generation research. More encouragingly, we create a large-scale *ChronoMagic-Pro* dataset, containing **460k** high-quality pairs of 720p time-lapse videos and detailed captions. Each caption ensures high physical content and large metamorphic amplitude, which have a far-reaching impact on the video generation community. The source data and code are publicly available on [https://pku-yuangroup.github.io/ChronoMagic-Bench](https://pku-yuangroup.github.io/ChronoMagic-Bench)."
Poster,CIFD: Controlled Information Flow to Enhance Knowledge Distillation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93054,"Yashas Malur Saidutta, Rakshith Sharma Srinivasa, Jaejin Cho, Ching-Hua Lee, Chouchang Yang, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin","Knowledge Distillation is the mechanism by which the insights gained from a larger teacher model are transferred to a smaller student model. However, the transfer suffers when the teacher model is significantly larger than the student. To overcome this, prior works have proposed training intermediately sized models, Teacher Assistants (TAs) to help the transfer process. However, training TAs is expensive, as training these models is a knowledge transfer task in itself. Further, these TAs are larger than the student model and training them especially in large data settings can be computationally intensive. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Controlled Information Flow for Knowledge Distillation (CIFD) consisting of two components. First, we propose a significantly smaller alternatives to TAs, the Rate-Distortion Module (RDM) which uses the teacher's penultimate layer embedding and a information rate-constrained bottleneck layer to replace the Teacher Assistant model. RDMs are smaller and easier to train than TAs, especially in large data regimes, since they operate on the teacher embeddings and do not need to relearn low level input feature extractors. Also, by varying the information rate across the bottleneck, RDMs can replace TAs of different sizes. Secondly, we propose the use of Information Bottleneck Module in the student model, which is crucial for regularization in the presence of a large number of RDMs. We show comprehensive state-of-the-art results of the proposed method over large datasets like Imagenet. Further, we show the significant improvement in distilling CLIP like models over a huge 12M image-text dataset. It outperforms CLIP specialized distillation methods across five zero-shot classification datasets and two zero-shot image-text retrieval datasets."
Poster,CigTime: Corrective Instruction Generation Through Inverse Motion Editing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94123,"Qihang Fang, Chengcheng Tang, Bugra Tekin, Yanchao Yang","Recent advancements in models linking natural language with human motions have shown significant promise in motion generation and editing based on instructional text. Motivated by applications in sports coaching and motor skill learning, we investigate the inverse problem: generating corrective instructional text, leveraging motion editing and generation models. We introduce a novel approach that, given a user’s current motion (source) and the desired motion (target), generates text instructions to guide the user towards achieving the target motion. We leverage large language models to generate corrective texts and utilize existing motion generation and editing frameworks to compile datasets of triplets (source motion, target motion, and corrective text). Using this data, we propose a new motion-language model for generating corrective instructions. We present both qualitative and quantitative results across a diverse range of applications that largely improve upon baselines. Our approach demonstrates its effectiveness in instructional scenarios, offering text-based guidance to correct and enhance user performance."
Poster,CiteME: Can Language Models Accurately Cite Scientific Claims?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97683,"Ori Press, Andreas Hochlehnert, Ameya Prabhu, Vishaal Udandarao, Ofir Press, Matthias Bethge","Thousands of new scientific papers are published each month. Such  information overload complicates researcher efforts to stay current with the state-of-the-art as well as to verify and correctly attribute claims. We pose the following research question: Given a text excerpt referencing a paper, could an LM act as a research assistant to correctly identify the referenced paper? We advance efforts to answer this question by building a benchmark that evaluates the abilities of LMs in citation attribution. Our benchmark, CiteME, consists  of text excerpts from recent machine learning papers, each referencing a single other paper. CiteME use reveals a large gap between frontier LMs and human performance, with LMs achieving only 4.2-18.5% accuracy and humans 69.7%. We close this gap by introducing CiteAgent, an autonomous system built on the GPT-4o LM that can also search and read papers, which achieves an accuracy of 35.3% on CiteME. Overall, CiteME serves as a challenging testbed for open-ended claim attribution, driving the research community towards a future where any claim made by an LM can be  automatically verified and discarded if found to be incorrect."
Poster,CLAP4CLIP: Continual Learning with Probabilistic Finetuning for Vision-Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93449,"Saurav Jha, Dong Gong, Lina Yao","Continual learning (CL) aims to help deep neural networks to learn new knowledge while retaining what has been learned. Owing to their powerful generalizability,  pre-trained vision-language models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)  have lately gained traction as practical CL candidates. However, the domain mismatch between the pre-training and the downstream CL tasks calls for finetuning of the CLIP on the latter. The deterministic nature of the existing finetuning methods makes them overlook the many possible interactions across the modalities and deems them unsafe for high-risk tasks requiring reliable uncertainty estimation. To address these, our work proposes **C**ontinual **L**e**A**rning with **P**robabilistic finetuning (CLAP) - a probabilistic modeling framework over visual-guided text features per task, thus providing more calibrated CL finetuning. Unlike recent data-hungry anti-forgetting CL techniques, CLAP alleviates forgetting by exploiting the rich pre-trained knowledge of CLIP for weight initialization and distribution regularization of task-specific parameters. Cooperating with the diverse range of existing prompting methods, CLAP can surpass the predominant deterministic finetuning approaches for CL with CLIP. We conclude with out-of-the-box applications of superior uncertainty estimation abilities of CLAP including novel data detection and exemplar selection within the existing CL setups.
