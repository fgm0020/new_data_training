Poster,Online Learning with Sublinear Best-Action Queries,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96293,"Matteo Russo, Andrea Celli, Riccardo Colini Baldeschi, Federico Fusco, Daniel Haimovich, Dima Karamshuk, Stefano Leonardi, Niek Tax","In online learning, a decision maker repeatedly selects one of a set of actions, with the goal of minimizing the overall loss incurred. Following the recent line of research on algorithms endowed with additional predictive features, we revisit this problem by allowing the decision maker to acquire additional information on the actions to be selected. In particular, we study the power of \emph{best-action queries}, which reveal beforehand the identity of the best action at a given time step. In practice, predictive features may be expensive, so we allow the decision maker to issue at most $k$ such queries.We establish tight bounds on the performance any algorithm can achieve when given access to $k$ best-action queries for different types of feedback models. In particular, we prove that in the full feedback model,  $k$ queries are enough to achieve an optimal regret of $\Theta(\min\{\sqrt T, \frac{T}{k}\})$. This finding highlights the significant multiplicative advantage in the regret rate achievable with even a modest (sublinear) number $k \in \Omega(\sqrt{T})$ of queries.    Additionally, we study the challenging setting in which the only available feedback is  obtained during the time steps corresponding to the $k$ best-action queries. There, we provide a tight regret rate of $\Theta(\min\{\frac{T}{\sqrt k},\frac{T^2}{k^2}\})$, which improves over the standard $\Theta(\frac{T}{\sqrt k})$ regret rate for label efficient prediction for $k \in \Omega(T^{2/3})$."
Poster,Online Non-convex Learning in Dynamic Environments,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96069,"Zhipan Xu, Lijun Zhang","This paper considers the problem of online learning with non-convex loss functions in dynamic environments. Recently, Suggala and Netrapalli [2020] demonstrated that follow the perturbed leader (FTPL) can achieve optimal regret for non-convex losses, but their results are limited to static environments. In this research, we examine dynamic environments and choose \emph{dynamic regret} and \emph{adaptive regret} to measure the performance. First, we propose an algorithm named FTPL-D by restarting FTPL periodically and establish $O(T^\frac{2}{3}(V_T+1)^\frac{1}{3})$ dynamic regret with the prior knowledge of $V_T$, which is the variation of loss functions. In the case that $V_T$ is unknown, we run multiple FTPL-D with different restarting parameters as experts and use a meta-algorithm to track the best one on the fly. To address the challenge of non-convexity, we utilize randomized sampling in the process of tracking experts. Next, we present a novel algorithm called FTPL-A that dynamically maintains a group of FTPL experts and combines them with an advanced meta-algorithm to obtain $O(\sqrt{\tau\log{T}})$ adaptive regret for any interval of length $\tau$. Moreover, we demonstrate that FTPL-A also attains an $\tilde{O}(T^\frac{2}{3}(V_T+1)^\frac{1}{3})$ dynamic regret bound. Finally, we discuss the application to online constrained meta-learning and conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of our methods."
Poster,Online Posterior Sampling with a Diffusion Prior,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96410,"Branislav Kveton, Boris Oreshkin, Youngsuk Park, Aniket Anand Deshmukh, Rui Song","Posterior sampling in contextual bandits with a Gaussian prior can be implemented exactly or approximately using the Laplace approximation. The Gaussian prior is computationally efficient but it cannot describe complex distributions. In this work, we propose approximate posterior sampling algorithms for contextual bandits with a diffusion model prior. The key idea is to sample from a chain of approximate conditional posteriors, one for each stage of the reverse diffusion process, which are obtained by the Laplace approximation. Our approximations are motivated by posterior sampling with a Gaussian prior, and inherit its simplicity and efficiency. They are asymptotically consistent and perform well empirically on a variety of contextual bandit problems."
Poster,Online Relational Inference for Evolving Multi-agent Interacting Systems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93739,"Beomseok Kang, Priyabrata Saha, Sudarshan Sharma, Biswadeep Chakraborty, Saibal Mukhopadhyay","We introduce a novel framework, Online Relational Inference (ORI), designed to efficiently identify hidden interaction graphs in evolving multi-agent interacting systems using streaming data. Unlike traditional offline methods that rely on a fixed training set, ORI employs online backpropagation, updating the model with each new data point, thereby allowing it to adapt to changing environments in real-time. A key innovation is the use of an adjacency matrix as a trainable parameter, optimized through a new adaptive learning rate technique called AdaRelation, which adjusts based on the historical sensitivity of the decoder to changes in the interaction graph. Additionally, a data augmentation method named Trajectory Mirror (TM) is introduced to improve generalization by exposing the model to varied trajectory patterns. Experimental results on both synthetic datasets and real-world data (CMU MoCap for human motion) demonstrate that ORI significantly improves the accuracy and adaptability of relational inference in dynamic settings compared to existing methods. This approach is model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with various neural relational inference (NRI) architectures, and offers a robust solution for real-time applications in complex, evolving systems."
Poster,OnlineTAS: An Online Baseline for Temporal Action Segmentation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94466,"Qing Zhong, Guodong Ding, Angela Yao","Temporal context plays a significant role in temporal action segmentation. In an offline setting, the context is typically captured by the segmentation network after observing the entire sequence. However, capturing and using such context information in an online setting remains an under-explored problem. This work presents the first online framework for temporal action segmentation. At the core of the framework is an adaptive memory designed to accommodate dynamic changes in context over time, alongside a feature augmentation module that enhances the frames with the memory. In addition, we propose a post-processing approach to mitigate the severe over-segmentation in the online setting. On three common segmentation benchmarks, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance."
Poster,Online Weighted Paging with Unknown Weights,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94374,"Orin Levy, Noam Touitou, Aviv Rosenberg","Online paging is a fundamental problem in the field of online algorithms, in which one maintains a cache of $k$ slots as requests for fetching pages arrive online. In the weighted variant of this problem, each page has its own fetching cost; a substantial line of work on this problem culminated in an (optimal) $O(\log k)$-competitive randomized algorithm, due to Bansal, Buchbinder and Naor (FOCS'07).Existing work for weighted paging assumes that page weights are known in advance, which is not always the case in practice.For example, in multi-level caching architectures, the expected cost of fetching a memory block is a function of its probability of being in a mid-level cache rather than the main memory.This complex property cannot be predicted in advance; over time, however, one may glean information about page weights through sampling their fetching cost multiple times.We present the first algorithm for online weighted paging that does not know page weights in advance, but rather learns from weight samples.In terms of techniques, this requires providing (integral) samples to a fractional solver, requiring a delicate interface between this solver and the randomized rounding scheme; we believe that our work can inspire online algorithms to other problems that involve cost sampling."
Poster,Only Strict Saddles in the Energy Landscape of Predictive Coding Networks?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94268,"Francesco Innocenti, El Mehdi Achour, Ryan Singh, Christopher L Buckley","Predictive coding (PC) is an energy-based learning algorithm that performs iterative inference over network activities before updating weights. Recent work suggests that PC can converge in fewer learning steps than backpropagation thanks to its inference procedure. However, these advantages are not always observed, and the impact of PC inference on learning is not theoretically well understood. To address this gap, we study the geometry of the PC weight landscape at the inference equilibrium of the network activities. For deep linear networks, we first show that the equilibrated PC energy is equal to a rescaled mean squared error loss with a weight-dependent rescaling. We then prove that many highly degenerate (non-strict) saddles of the loss including the origin become much easier to escape (strict) in the equilibrated energy. Experiments on both linear and non-linear networks strongly validate our theory and further suggest that all the saddles of the equilibrated energy are strict. Overall, this work shows that PC inference makes the loss landscape of feedforward networks more benign and robust to vanishing gradients, while also highlighting the fundamental challenge of scaling PC to very deep models."
Poster,On Mesa-Optimization in Autoregressively Trained Transformers: Emergence and Capability,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96062,"Chenyu Zheng, Wei Huang, Rongzhen Wang, Guoqiang Wu, Jun Zhu, Chongxuan LI","Autoregressively trained transformers have brought a profound revolution to the world, especially with their in-context learning (ICL) ability to address downstream tasks. Recently, several studies suggest that transformers learn a mesa-optimizer during autoregressive (AR) pretraining to implement ICL. Namely, the forward pass of the trained transformer is equivalent to optimizing an inner objective function in-context.However, whether the practical non-convex training dynamics will converge to the ideal mesa-optimizer is still unclear.Towards filling this gap, we investigate the non-convex dynamics of a one-layer linear causal self-attention model autoregressively trained by gradient flow, where the sequences are generated by an AR process $x_{t+1} = W x_t$. First, under a certain condition of data distribution, we prove that an autoregressively trained transformer learns $W$ by implementing one step of gradient descent to minimize an ordinary least squares (OLS) problem in-context. It then applies the learned $\widehat{W}$ for next-token prediction, thereby verifying the mesa-optimization hypothesis. Next, under the same data conditions, we explore the capability limitations of the obtained mesa-optimizer. We show that a stronger assumption related to the moments of data is the sufficient and necessary condition that the learned mesa-optimizer recovers the distribution. Besides, we conduct exploratory analyses beyond the first data condition and prove that generally, the trained transformer will not perform vanilla gradient descent for the OLS problem. Finally, our simulation results verify the theoretical results."
Poster,On Neural Networks as Infinite Tree-Structured Probabilistic Graphical Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95652,"Boyao Li, Alexander Thomson, houssam nassif, Matthew Engelhard, David Page","Deep neural networks (DNNs) lack the precise semantics and definitive probabilistic interpretation of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). In this paper, we propose an innovative solution by constructing infinite tree-structured PGMs that correspond exactly to neural networks. Our research reveals that DNNs, during forward propagation, indeed perform approximations of PGM inference that are precise in this alternative PGM structure. Not only does our research complement existing studies that describe neural networks as kernel machines or infinite-sized Gaussian processes, it also elucidates a more direct approximation that DNNs make to exact inference in PGMs. Potential benefits include improved pedagogy and interpretation of DNNs, and algorithms that can merge the strengths of PGMs and DNNs."
Poster,On provable privacy vulnerabilities of graph representations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95590,"Ruofan Wu, Guanhua Fang, Mingyang Zhang, Qiying Pan, Tengfei LIU, Weiqiang Wang","Graph representation learning (GRL) is critical for extracting insights from complex network structures, but it also raises security concerns due to potential privacy vulnerabilities in these representations. This paper investigates the structural vulnerabilities in graph neural models where sensitive topological information can be inferred through edge reconstruction attacks. Our research primarily addresses the theoretical underpinnings of similarity-based edge reconstruction attacks (SERA), furnishing a non-asymptotic analysis of their reconstruction capacities. Moreover, we present empirical corroboration indicating that such attacks can perfectly reconstruct sparse graphs as graph size increases. Conversely, we establish that sparsity is a critical factor for SERA's effectiveness, as demonstrated through analysis and experiments on (dense) stochastic block models. Finally, we explore the resilience of private graph representations produced via noisy aggregation (NAG) mechanism against SERA. Through theoretical analysis and empirical assessments, we affirm the mitigation of SERA using NAG . In parallel, we also empirically delineate instances wherein SERA demonstrates both efficacy and deficiency in its capacity to function as an instrument for elucidating the trade-off between privacy and utility."
