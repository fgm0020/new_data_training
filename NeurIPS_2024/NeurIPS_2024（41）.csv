Poster,AudioMarkBench: Benchmarking Robustness of Audio Watermarking,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97471,"Hongbin Liu, Moyang Guo, Zhengyuan Jiang, Lun Wang, Neil Gong","The increasing realism of synthetic speech, driven by advancements in text-to-speech models, raises ethical concerns regarding impersonation and disinformation. Audio watermarking offers a promising solution via embedding human-imperceptible watermarks into AI-generated audios. However, the robustness of audio watermarking against common/adversarial perturbations remains understudied. We present AudioMarkBench, the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the robustness of audio watermarking against *watermark removal* and *watermark forgery*. AudioMarkBench includes a new dataset created from Common-Voice across languages, biological sexes, and ages, 3 state-of-the-art watermarking methods, and 15 types of perturbations. We benchmark the robustness of these methods against the perturbations in no-box, black-box, and white-box settings. Our findings highlight the vulnerabilities of current watermarking techniques and emphasize the need for more robust and fair audio watermarking solutions. Our dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/moyangkuo/AudioMarkBench."
Poster,Auditing Local Explanations is Hard,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93005,"Robi Bhattacharjee, Ulrike Luxburg","In sensitive contexts, providers of machine learning algorithms are increasingly required to give explanations for their algorithms' decisions. However, explanation receivers might not trust the provider, who potentially could output misleading or manipulated explanations. In this work, we investigate an auditing framework in which a third-party auditor or a collective of users attempts to sanity-check explanations: they can query model decisions and the corresponding local explanations, pool all the information received, and then check for basic consistency properties. We prove upper and lower bounds on the amount of queries that are needed for an auditor to succeed within this framework. Our results show that successful auditing requires a potentially exorbitant number of queries -- particularly in high dimensional cases. Our analysis also reveals that a key property is the ``locality'' of the provided explanations --- a quantity that so far has not been paid much attention to in the explainability literature. Looking forward, our results suggest that for complex high-dimensional settings, merely providing a pointwise prediction and explanation could be insufficient, as there is no way for the users to verify that the provided explanations are not completely made-up."
Poster,Auditing Privacy Mechanisms via Label Inference Attacks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96236,"Róbert Busa-Fekete, Travis Dick, Claudio Gentile, Andres Munoz Medina, Adam Smith, Marika Swanberg","We propose reconstruction advantage measures to audit label privatization mechanisms. A reconstruction advantage measure quantifies the increase in an attacker's ability to infer the true label of an unlabeled example when provided with a private version of the labels in a dataset (e.g., aggregate of labels from different users or noisy labels output by randomized response), compared to an attacker that only observes the feature vectors, but may have prior knowledge of the correlation between features and labels. We consider two such auditing measures: one additive, and on multiplicative. These cover previous approaches taken in the literature on empirical auditing and differential privacy. These measures allow us to place a variety of proposed privatization schemes---some differentially private, some not---on the same footing. We analyze these measures theoretically under a distributional model which, we claim, encapsulates reasonable adversarial settings. We also quantify their behavior empirically on real and simulated  prediction tasks. Across a range of experimental settings, we find that differentially private schemes dominate or match the privacy-utility tradeoff of more heuristic approaches."
Poster,"A Unified Confidence Sequence for Generalized Linear Models, with Applications to Bandits",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95540,"Junghyun Lee, Se-Young Yun, Kwang-Sung Jun","We present a unified likelihood ratio-based confidence sequence (CS) for *any* (self-concordant) generalized linear model (GLM) that is guaranteed to be convex and numerically tight. We show that this is on par or improves upon known CSs for various GLMs, including Gaussian, Bernoulli, and Poisson. In particular, for the first time, our CS for Bernoulli has a $\mathrm{poly}(S)$-free radius where $S$ is the norm of the unknown parameter. Our first technical novelty is its derivation, which utilizes a time-uniform PAC-Bayesian bound with a uniform prior/posterior, despite the latter being a rather unpopular choice for deriving CSs. As a direct application of our new CS, we propose a simple and natural optimistic algorithm called **OFUGLB**, applicable to *any* generalized linear bandits (**GLB**; Filippi et al. (2010)). Our analysis shows that the celebrated optimistic approach simultaneously attains state-of-the-art regrets for various self-concordant (not necessarily bounded) **GLB**s, and even $\mathrm{poly}(S)$-free for bounded **GLB**s, including logistic bandits. The regret analysis, our second technical novelty, follows from combining our new CS with a new proof technique that completely avoids the previously widely used self-concordant control lemma (Faury et al., 2020, Lemma 9). Numerically, **OFUGLB** outperforms or is at par with prior algorithms for logistic bandits."
Poster,A Unified Debiasing Approach for Vision-Language Models across Modalities and Tasks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96884,"Hoin Jung, Taeuk Jang, Xiaoqian Wang","Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled complex multimodal tasks by processing text and image data simultaneously, significantly enhancing the field of artificial intelligence. However, these models often exhibit biases that can skew outputs towards societal stereotypes, thus necessitating debiasing strategies. Existing debiasing methods focus narrowly on specific modalities or tasks, and require extensive retraining. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Selective Feature Imputation for Debiasing (SFID), a novel methodology that integrates feature pruning and low confidence imputation (LCI) to effectively reduce biases in VLMs. SFID is versatile, maintaining the semantic integrity of outputs and costly effective by eliminating the need for retraining. Our experimental results demonstrate SFID's effectiveness across various VLMs tasks including zero-shot classification, text-to-image retrieval, image captioning, and text-to-image generation, by significantly reducing gender biases without compromising performance. This approach not only enhances the fairness of VLMs applications but also preserves their efficiency and utility across diverse scenarios."
Poster,A Unified Framework for 3D Scene Understanding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94353,"Wei Xu, Chunsheng Shi, Sifan Tu, Xin Zhou, Dingkang Liang, Xiang Bai","We propose UniSeg3D, a unified 3D scene understanding framework that achieves panoptic, semantic, instance, interactive, referring, and open-vocabulary segmentation tasks within a single model. Most previous 3D segmentation approaches are typically tailored to a specific task, limiting their understanding of 3D scenes to a task-specific perspective. In contrast, the proposed method unifies six tasks into unified representations processed by the same Transformer. It facilitates inter-task knowledge sharing, thereby promoting comprehensive 3D scene understanding. To take advantage of multi-task unification, we enhance performance by establishing explicit inter-task associations. Specifically, we design knowledge distillation and contrastive learning to transfer task-specific knowledge across different tasks. Experiments on three benchmarks, including ScanNet20, ScanRefer, and ScanNet200, demonstrate that the UniSeg3D consistently outperforms current SOTA methods, even those specialized for individual tasks. We hope UniSeg3D can serve as a solid unified baseline and inspire future work. Code and models are available at \url{https://dk-liang.github.io/UniSeg3D/}."
Poster,A Unified Principle of Pessimism for Offline Reinforcement Learning under Model Mismatch,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94438,"Yue Wang, Zhongchang Sun, Shaofeng Zou","In this paper, we address the challenges of offline reinforcement learning (RL) under model mismatch, where the agent aims to optimize its performance through an offline dataset that may not accurately represent the deployment environment. We identify two primary challenges under the setting: inaccurate model estimation due to limited data and performance degradation caused by the model mismatch between the dataset-collecting environment and the target deployment one. To tackle these issues, we propose a unified principle of pessimism using distributionally robust Markov decision processes. We carefully construct a robust MDP with a single uncertainty set to tackle both data sparsity and model mismatch, and demonstrate that the optimal robust policy enjoys a near-optimal sub-optimality gap under the target environment across three widely used uncertainty models: total variation, $\chi^2$ divergence, and KL divergence. Our results improve upon or match the state-of-the-art performance under the total variation and KL divergence models, and provide the first result for the $\chi^2$ divergence model."
Poster,A Unified Recipe for Deriving (Time-Uniform) PAC-Bayes Bounds,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/98308,"Ben Chugg, Hongjian Wang, Aaditya Ramdas","We present a unified framework for deriving PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds. Unlike most previous literature on this topic, our bounds are anytime-valid (i.e., time-uniform), meaning that they hold at all stopping times, not only for a fixed sample size. Our approach combines four tools in the following order: (a) nonnegative supermartingales or reverse submartingales, (b) the method of mixtures, (c) the Donsker-Varadhan formula (or other convex duality principles), and (d) Ville's inequality. Our main result is a PAC-Bayes theorem which holds for a wide class of discrete stochastic processes. We show how this result implies time-uniform versions of well-known classical PAC-Bayes bounds, such as those of Seeger, McAllester, Maurer, and Catoni, in addition to many recent bounds. We also present several novel bounds. Our framework also enables us to relax traditional assumptions; in particular, we consider nonstationary loss functions and non-iid data. In sum, we unify the derivation of past bounds and ease the search for future bounds: one may simply check if our supermartingale or submartingale conditions are met and, if so, be guaranteed a (time-uniform) PAC-Bayes bound."
Poster,A Unifying Normative Framework of Decision Confidence,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96189,"Amelia Johnson, Michael Buice, Koosha Khalvati","Self-assessment of one’s choices, i.e., confidence, is the topic of many decision neuroscience studies. Computational models of confidence, however, are limited to specific scenarios such as between choices with the same value. Here we present a normative framework for modeling decision confidence that is generalizable to various tasks and experimental setups. We further drive the implications of our model from both theoretical and experimental points of view. Specifically, we show that our model maps to the planning as an inference framework where the objective function is maximizing the gained reward and information entropy of the policy. Moreover, we validate our model on two different psychophysics experiments and show its superiority over other approaches in explaining subjects' confidence reports."
Poster,A Unifying Post-Processing Framework for Multi-Objective Learn-to-Defer Problems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95484,"Mohammad-Amin Charusaie, Samira Samadi","Learn-to-Defer is a paradigm that enables learning algorithms to work not in isolation but as a team with human experts. In this paradigm, we permit the system to defer a subset of its tasks to the expert. Although there are currently systems that follow this paradigm and are designed to optimize the accuracy of the final human-AI team, the general methodology for developing such systems under a set of constraints (e.g., algorithmic fairness, expert intervention budget, defer of anomaly, etc.) remains largely unexplored. In this paper, using a d-dimensional generalization to the fundamental lemma of Neyman and Pearson (d-GNP), we obtain the Bayes optimal solution for learn-to-defer systems under various constraints. Furthermore, we design a generalizable algorithm to estimate that solution and apply this algorithm to the COMPAS, Hatespeech, and ACSIncome datasets. Our algorithm shows improvements in terms of constraint violation over a set of learn-to-defer baselines and can control multiple constraint violations at once. The use of d-GNP is beyond learn-to-defer applications and can potentially obtain a solution to decision-making problems with a set of controlled expected performance measures."
