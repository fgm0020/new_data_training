Poster,Universal In-Context Approximation By Prompting Fully Recurrent Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95875,"Aleksandar Petrov, Tom Lamb, Alasdair Paren, Philip Torr, Adel Bibi","Zero-shot and in-context learning enable solving tasks without model fine-tuning, making them essential for developing generative model solutions. Therefore, it is crucial to understand whether a pretrained model can be prompted to approximate any function, i.e., whether it is a universal in-context approximator. While it was recently shown that transformer models do possess this property, these results rely on their attention mechanism. Hence, these findings do not apply to fully recurrent architectures like RNNs, LSTMs, and the increasingly popular SSMs. We demonstrate that RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, Linear RNNs, and linear gated architectures such as Mamba and Hawk/Griffin can also serve be universal in-context approximators. To streamline our argument, we introduce a programming language called LSRL that compiles to these fully recurrent architectures. LSRL may be of independent interest for further studies of fully recurrent models, such as constructing interpretability benchmarks. We also study the role of multiplicative gating and observe that architectures incorporating such gating (e.g., LSTMs, GRUs, Hawk/Griffin) can implement certain operations more stably, making them more viable candidates for practical in-context universal approximation."
Poster,Universality in Transfer Learning for Linear Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95498,"Reza Ghane, Danil Akhtiamov, Babak Hassibi","We study the problem of transfer learning and fine-tuning in linear models for both regression and binary classification. In particular, we consider the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on a linear model initialized with pretrained weights and using a small training data set from the target distribution. In the asymptotic regime of large models, we provide an exact and rigorous analysis and relate the generalization errors (in regression) and classification errors (in binary classification) for the pretrained and fine-tuned models. In particular, we give conditions under which the fine-tuned model outperforms the pretrained one. An important aspect of our work is that all the results are ""universal"", in the sense that they depend only on the first and second order statistics of the target distribution. They thus extend well beyond the standard Gaussian assumptions commonly made in the literature. Furthermore, our universality results extend beyond standard SGD training to the test error of a classification task trained using ridge regression."
Poster,"Universality of AdaGrad Stepsizes for Stochastic Optimization: Inexact Oracle, Acceleration and Variance Reduction",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93414,"Anton Rodomanov, Xiaowen Jiang, Sebastian Stich","We present adaptive gradient methods (both basic and accelerated) for solvingconvex composite optimization problems in which the main part is approximatelysmooth (a.k.a. $(\delta, L)$-smooth) and can be accessed only via a(potentially biased) stochastic gradient oracle.This setting covers many interesting examples including Hölder smooth problemsand various inexact computations of the stochastic gradient.Our methods use AdaGrad stepsizes and are adaptive in the sense that they donot require knowing any problem-dependent constants except an estimate of thediameter of the feasible set but nevertheless achieve the best possibleconvergence rates as if they knew the corresponding constants.We demonstrate that AdaGrad stepsizes work in a variety of situationsby proving, in a unified manner, three types of new results.First, we establish efficiency guarantees for our methods in the classicalsetting where the oracle's variance is uniformly bounded.We then show that, under more refined assumptions on the variance,the same methods without any modifications enjoy implicit variancereduction properties allowing us to express their complexity estimates interms of the variance only at the minimizer.Finally, we show how to incorporate explicit SVRG-type variance reduction intoour methods and obtain even faster algorithms.In all three cases, we present both basic and accelerated algorithmsachieving state-of-the-art complexity bounds.As a direct corollary of our results, we obtain universal stochastic gradientmethods for Hölder smooth problems which can be used in all situations."
Poster,Universal Neural Functionals,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94854,"Allan Zhou, Chelsea Finn, James Harrison","A challenging problem in many modern machine learning tasks is to process weight-space features, i.e., to transform or extract information from the weights and gradients of a neural network. Recent works have developed promising weight-space models that are equivariant to the permutation symmetries of simple feedforward networks. However, they are not applicable to general architectures, since the permutation symmetries of a weight space can be complicated by recurrence or residual connections. This work proposes an algorithm that automatically constructs permutation equivariant models, which we refer to as universal neural functionals (UNFs), for any weight space. Among other applications, we demonstrate how UNFs can be substituted into existing learned optimizer designs, and find promising improvements over prior methods when optimizing small image classifiers and language models. Our results suggest that learned optimizers can benefit from considering the (symmetry) structure of the weight space they optimize."
Poster,Universal Online Convex Optimization with $1$ Projection per Round,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93090,"Wenhao Yang, Yibo Wang, Peng Zhao, Lijun Zhang","To address the uncertainty in function types, recent progress in online convex optimization (OCO) has spurred the development of universal algorithms that simultaneously attain minimax rates for multiple types of convex functions. However, for a $T$-round online problem, state-of-the-art methods typically conduct $O(\log T)$ projections onto the domain in each round, a process potentially time-consuming with complicated feasible sets. In this paper, inspired by the black-box reduction of Cutkosky and Orabona [2018], we employ a surrogate loss defined over simpler domains to develop universal OCO algorithms that only require $1$ projection. Embracing the framework of prediction with expert advice, we maintain a set of experts for each type of functions and aggregate their predictions via a meta-algorithm. The crux of our approach lies in a uniquely designed expert-loss for strongly convex functions, stemming from an innovative decomposition of the regret into the meta-regret and the expert-regret. Our analysis sheds new light on the surrogate loss, facilitating a rigorous examination of the discrepancy between the regret of the original loss and that of the surrogate loss, and carefully controlling meta-regret under the strong convexity condition. With only $1$ projection per round, we establish optimal regret bounds for general convex, exponentially concave, and strongly convex functions simultaneously. Furthermore, we enhance the expert-loss to exploit the smoothness property, and demonstrate that our algorithm can attain small-loss regret for multiple types of convex and smooth functions."
Poster,Universal Physics Transformers: A Framework For Efficiently Scaling Neural Operators,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93621,"Benedikt Alkin, Andreas Fürst, Simon Schmid, Lukas Gruber, Markus Holzleitner, Johannes Brandstetter","Neural operators, serving as physics surrogate models, have recently gained increased interest. With ever increasing problem complexity, the natural question arises: what is an efficient way to scale neural operators to larger and more complex simulations - most importantly by taking into account different types of simulation datasets. This is of special interest since, akin to their numerical counterparts, different techniques are used across applications, even if the underlying dynamics of the systems are similar. Whereas the flexibility of transformers has enabled unified architectures across domains, neural operators mostly follow a problem specific design, where GNNs are commonly used for Lagrangian simulations and grid-based models predominate Eulerian simulations. We introduce Universal Physics Transformers (UPTs), an efficient and unified learning paradigm for a wide range of spatio-temporal problems. UPTs operate without grid- or particle-based latent structures, enabling flexibility and scalability across meshes and particles. UPTs efficiently propagate dynamics in the latent space, emphasized by inverse encoding and decoding techniques. Finally, UPTs allow for queries of the latent space representation at any point in space-time. We demonstrate diverse applicability and efficacy of UPTs in mesh-based fluid simulations, and steady-state Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, and Lagrangian-based dynamics."
Poster,Universal Rates for Active Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95062,"Steve Hanneke, Amin Karbasi, Shay Moran, Grigoris Velegkas","In this work we study the problem of actively learning binary classifiers  from a given concept class, i.e., learning by utilizing unlabeled data   and submitting targeted queries about their labels to a domain expert.  We evaluate the quality of our solutions by considering the learning curves  they induce, i.e., the rate of decrease  of the misclassification probability as the number of label queries  increases. The majority of the literature on active learning has   focused on obtaining uniform guarantees on the error rate which are  only able to explain the upper envelope of the learning curves over families  of different data-generating distributions. We diverge from this line of  work and we focus on the distribution-dependent framework of universal  learning whose goal is to obtain guarantees that hold for any fixed distribution,  but do not apply uniformly over all the distributions. We provide a   complete characterization of the optimal learning rates that are achievable  by algorithms that have to specify the number of unlabeled examples they  use ahead of their execution. Moreover, we identify combinatorial complexity  measures that give rise to each case of our tetrachotomic characterization.  This resolves an open question that was posed by Balcan et al. (2010).  As a byproduct of our main result,  we develop an active learning algorithm for partial concept classes  that achieves exponential learning rates in the uniform setting."
Poster,Universal Rates of Empirical Risk Minimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96512,"Steve Hanneke, Mingyue Xu","The well-known $\textit{empirical risk minimization}$ (ERM) principle is the basis of many widely used machine learning algorithms, and plays an essential role in the classical PAC theory. A common description of a learning algorithm's performance is its so-called “learning curve”, that is, the decay of the expected error as a function of the input sample size. As the PAC model fails to explain the behavior of learning curves, recent research has explored an alternative universal learning model and has ultimately revealed a distinction between optimal universal and uniform learning rates (Bousquet et al., 2021). However, a basic understanding of such differences with a particular focus on the ERM principle has yet to be developed.     In this paper, we consider the problem of universal learning by ERM in the realizable case and study the possible universal rates. Our main result is a fundamental $\textit{tetrachotomy}$: there are only four possible universal learning rates by ERM, namely, the learning curves of any concept class learnable by ERM decay either at $e^{-n}$, $1/n$, $\log{(n)}/n$, or arbitrarily slow rates. Moreover, we provide a complete characterization of which concept classes fall into each of these categories, via new complexity structures. We also develop new combinatorial dimensions which supply sharp asymptotically-valid constant factors for these rates, whenever possible."
Poster,Universal Sample Coding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93482,"Szymon Kobus, Tze-Yang Tung, Deniz Gunduz","In this work, we study the problem of communicating multiple samples from an unknown probability distribution using as few bits as possible. This is a generalization of the channel simulation problem, which has recently found applications and achieved state of the art results in realistic image compression, neural network compression, and communication-efficient federated learning. In this problem, the transmitter wants the receiver to generate multiple independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples from a target distribution $P$, while the transmitter and the receiver have access to independent samples from a reference distribution $Q$. The core idea is to employ channel simulation in multiple rounds while updating the reference distribution $Q$ after each round in order to reduce the KL-divergence between $P$ and $Q$, thereby reducing the communication cost in subsequent rounds. We derive a lower bound on the expected communication cost and construct a practical algorithm that achieves the lower bound up to a multiplicative constant. We then employ this algorithm in communication-efficient federated learning, in which model updates correspond to samples from a distribution, and achieve a 37% reduction in the communication load. To further highlight the potential of sample communication for generative models, we show that the number of bits needed to communicate samples from a large language model can be reduced by up to 16 times, compared to entropy-based data compression."
Poster,Unlearnable 3D Point Clouds: Class-wise Transformation Is All You Need,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95089,"Xianlong Wang, Minghui Li, Wei Liu, Hangtao Zhang, Shengshan Hu, Yechao Zhang, Ziqi Zhou, Hai Jin","Traditional unlearnable strategies have been proposed to prevent unauthorized users from training on the 2D image data. With more 3D point cloud data containing sensitivity information, unauthorized usage of this new type data has also become a serious concern. To address this, we propose the first integral unlearnable framework for 3D point clouds including two processes: (i) we propose an unlearnable data protection scheme, involving a class-wise setting established by a category-adaptive allocation strategy and multi-transformations assigned to samples; (ii) we propose a data restoration scheme that utilizes class-wise inverse matrix transformation, thus enabling authorized-only training for unlearnable data. This restoration process is a practical issue overlooked in most existing unlearnable literature, i.e., even authorized users struggle to gain knowledge from 3D unlearnable data. Both theoretical and empirical results (including 6 datasets, 16 models, and 2 tasks) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed unlearnable framework.
