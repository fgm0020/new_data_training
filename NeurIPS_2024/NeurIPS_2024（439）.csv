Poster,Video Token Merging for Long Video Understanding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93137,"Seon-Ho Lee, Jue Wang, Zhikang Zhang, David Fan, Xinyu Li","As the scale of data and models for video understanding rapidly expand, handling long-form video input in transformer-based models presents a practical challenge. Rather than resorting to input sampling or token dropping, which may result in information loss, token merging shows promising results when used in collaboration with transformers. However, the application of token merging for long-form video processing is not trivial. We begin with the premise that token merging should not rely solely on the similarity of video tokens; the saliency of tokens should also be considered. To address this, we explore various video token merging strategies for long-form video classification, starting with a simple extension of image token merging, moving to region-concentrated merging, and finally proposing a learnable video token merging (VTM) algorithm that dynamically merges tokens based on their saliency. Extensive experimental results show that we achieve better or comparable performances on the LVU, COIN, and Breakfast datasets. Moreover, our approach significantly reduces memory costs by 84% and boosts throughput by approximately 6.89 times compared to baseline algorithms."
Poster,VidMan: Exploiting Implicit Dynamics from Video Diffusion Model for Effective Robot Manipulation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94687,"Youpeng Wen, Junfan Lin, Yi Zhu, Jianhua Han, Hang Xu, Shen Zhao, Xiaodan Liang","Recent advancements utilizing large-scale video data for learning video generation models demonstrate significant potential in understanding complex physical dynamics. It suggests the feasibility of leveraging diverse robot trajectory data to develop a unified, dynamics-aware model to enhance robot manipulation. However, given the relatively small amount of available robot data, directly fitting data without considering the relationship between visual observations and actions could lead to suboptimal data utilization. To this end, we propose \textbf{VidMan} (\textbf{Vid}eo Diffusion for Robot \textbf{Man}ipulation), a novel framework that employs a two-stage training mechanism inspired by dual-process theory from neuroscience to enhance stability and improve data utilization efficiency. Specifically, in the first stage, VidMan is pre-trained on the Open X-Embodiment dataset (OXE) for predicting future visual trajectories in a video denoising diffusion manner, enabling the model to develop a long horizontal awareness of the environment's dynamics. In the second stage, a flexible yet effective layer-wise self-attention adapter is introduced to transform VidMan into an efficient inverse dynamics model that predicts action modulated by the implicit dynamics knowledge via parameter sharing. Our VidMan framework outperforms state-of-the-art baseline model GR-1 on the CALVIN benchmark, achieving a 11.7\% relative improvement, and demonstrates over 9\% precision gains on the OXE small-scale dataset. These results provide compelling evidence that world models can significantly enhance the precision of robot action prediction. Codes and models will be public."
Poster,VidProM: A Million-scale Real Prompt-Gallery Dataset for Text-to-Video Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97505,"Wenhao Wang, Yi Yang","The arrival of Sora marks a new era for text-to-video diffusion models, bringing significant advancements in video generation and potential applications. However, Sora, along with other text-to-video diffusion models, is highly reliant on prompts, and there is no publicly available dataset that features a study of text-to-video prompts. In this paper, we introduce VidProM, the first large-scale dataset comprising 1.67 Million unique text-to-Video Prompts from real users. Additionally, this dataset includes 6.69 million videos generated by four state-of-the-art diffusion models, alongside some related data. We initially discuss the curation of this large-scale dataset, a process that is both time-consuming and costly. Subsequently, we underscore the need for a new prompt dataset specifically designed for text-to-video generation by illustrating how VidProM differs from DiffusionDB, a large-scale prompt-gallery dataset for image generation. Our extensive and diverse dataset also opens up many exciting new research areas. For instance, we suggest exploring text-to-video prompt engineering, efficient video generation, and video copy detection for diffusion models to develop better, more efficient, and safer models. The project (including the collected dataset VidProM and related code) is publicly available at https://vidprom.github.io under the CC-BY-NC 4.0 License."
Poster,Vidu4D: Single Generated Video to High-Fidelity 4D Reconstruction with Dynamic Gaussian Surfels,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96432,"Yikai Wang, Xinzhou Wang, Zilong Chen, Zhengyi Wang, Fuchun Sun, Jun Zhu","Video generative models are receiving particular attention given their ability to generate realistic and imaginative frames. Besides, these models are also observed to exhibit strong 3D consistency, significantly enhancing their potential to act as world simulators.  In this work, we present Vidu4D, a novel reconstruction model that excels in accurately reconstructing 4D (i.e., sequential 3D) representations from single generated videos, addressing challenges associated with non-rigidity and frame distortion. This capability is pivotal for creating high-fidelity virtual contents that maintain both spatial and temporal coherence. At the core of Vidu4D is our proposed Dynamic Gaussian Surfels (DGS) technique. DGS optimizes time-varying warping functions to transform Gaussian surfels (surface elements) from a static state to a dynamically warped state. This transformation enables a precise depiction of motion and deformation over time. To preserve the structural integrity of surface-aligned Gaussian surfels, we design the warped-state geometric regularization based on continuous warping fields for estimating normals. Additionally, we learn refinements on rotation and scaling parameters of Gaussian surfels, which greatly alleviates texture flickering during the warping process and enhances the capture of fine-grained appearance details. Vidu4D also contains a novel initialization state that provides a proper start for the warping fields in DGS. Equipping Vidu4D with an existing video generative model, the overall framework demonstrates high-fidelity text-to-4D generation in both appearance and geometry."
Poster,ViLCo-Bench: VIdeo Language COntinual learning Benchmark,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97567,"Tianqi Tang, Shohreh Deldari, Hao Xue, Celso de Melo, Flora Salim","Video language continual learning involves continuously adapting to information from video and text inputs, enhancing a model’s ability to handle new tasks while retaining prior knowledge. This field is a relatively under-explored area, and establishing appropriate datasets is crucial for facilitating communication and research in this field. In this study, we present the first dedicated benchmark, ViLCo-Bench, designed to evaluate continual learning models across a range of video-text tasks. The dataset comprises ten-minute-long videos and corresponding language queries collected from publicly available datasets. Additionally, we introduce a novel memory-efficient framework that incorporates self-supervised learning and mimics long-term and short-term memory effects. This framework addresses challenges including memory complexity from long video clips, natural language complexity from open queries, and text-video misalignment. We posit that ViLCo-Bench, with greater complexity compared to existing continual learning benchmarks, would serve as a critical tool for exploring the video-language domain, extending beyond conventional class-incremental tasks, and addressing complex and limited annotation issues. The curated data, evaluations, and our novel method are available at https://github.com/cruiseresearchgroup/ViLCo."
Poster,Virtual Scanning: Unsupervised Non-line-of-sight Imaging from Irregularly Undersampled Transients,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95200,"Xingyu Cui, Huanjing Yue, Song Li, Xiangjun Yin, Yusen Hou, Yun Meng, Kai Zou, Xiaolong Hu, Jingyu Yang","Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging allows for seeing hidden scenes around corners through active sensing.Most previous algorithms for NLOS reconstruction require dense transients acquired through regular scans over a large relay surface, which limits their applicability in realistic scenarios with irregular relay surfaces.In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning-based framework for NLOS imaging from irregularly undersampled transients~(IUT).Our method learns implicit priors from noisy irregularly undersampled transients without requiring paired data, which is difficult and expensive to acquire and align. To overcome the ambiguity of the measurement consistency constraint in inferring the albedo volume, we design a virtual scanning process that enables the network to learn within both range and null spaces for high-quality reconstruction.We devise a physics-guided SURE-based denoiser to enhance robustness to ubiquitous noise in low-photon imaging conditions. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world data validate the performance and generalization of our method.Compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, our method achieves higher fidelity, greater robustness, and remarkably faster inference times by orders of magnitude.The code and model are available at https://github.com/XingyuCuii/Virtual-Scanning-NLOS."
Poster,VISA: Variational Inference with Sequential Sample-Average Approximations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93819,"Heiko Zimmermann, Christian Andersson Naesseth, Jan-Willem van de Meent","We present variational inference with sequential sample-average approximations (VISA), a method for approximate inference in computationally intensive models, such as those based on numerical simulations. VISA extends importance-weighted forward-KL variational inference by employing a sequence of sample-average approximations, which are considered valid inside a trust region. This makes it possible to reuse model evaluations across multiple gradient steps, thereby reducing computational cost. We perform experiments on high-dimensional Gaussians, Lotka-Volterra dynamics, and a Pickover attractor, which demonstrate that VISA can achieve comparable approximation accuracy to standard importance-weighted forward-KL variational inference with computational savings of a factor two or more for conservatively chosen learning rates."
Poster,Vision Foundation Model Enables Generalizable Object Pose Estimation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95972,"Kai Chen, Yiyao Ma, Xingyu Lin, Stephen James, Jianshu Zhou, Yun-Hui Liu, Pieter Abbeel, DOU QI","Object pose estimation plays a crucial role in robotic manipulation, however, its practical applicability still suffers from limited generalizability. This paper addresses the challenge of generalizable object pose estimation, particularly focusing on category-level object pose estimation for unseen object categories. Current methods either require impractical instance-level training or are confined to predefined categories, limiting their applicability. We propose VFM-6D, a novel framework that explores harnessing existing vision and language models, to elaborate object pose estimation into two stages: category-level object viewpoint estimation and object coordinate map estimation. Based on the two-stage framework, we introduce a 2D-to-3D feature lifting module and a shape-matching module, both of which leverage pre-trained vision foundation models to improve object representation and matching accuracy. VFM-6D is trained on cost-effective synthetic data and exhibits superior generalization capabilities. It can be applied to both instance-level unseen object pose estimation and category-level object pose estimation for novel categories. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of VFM-6D in various real-world scenarios."
Poster,Vision-Language Models are Strong Noisy Label Detectors,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94056,"Tong Wei, Hao-Tian Li, ChunShu Li, Jiang-Xin Shi, Yu-Feng Li, Min-Ling Zhang","Recent research on fine-tuning vision-language models has demonstrated impressive performance in various downstream tasks. However, the challenge of obtaining accurately labeled data in real-world applications poses a significant obstacle during the fine-tuning process. To address this challenge, this paper presents a Denoising Fine-Tuning framework, called DeFT, for adapting vision-language models. DeFT utilizes the robust alignment of textual and visual features pre-trained on millions of auxiliary image-text pairs to sieve out noisy labels. The proposed framework establishes a noisy label detector by learning positive and negative textual prompts for each class. The positive prompt seeks to reveal distinctive features of the class, while the negative prompt serves as a learnable threshold for separating clean and noisy samples. We employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning for the adaptation of a pre-trained visual encoder to promote its alignment with the learned textual prompts. As a general framework, DeFT can seamlessly fine-tune many pre-trained models to downstream tasks by utilizing carefully selected clean samples. Experimental results on seven synthetic and real-world noisy datasets validate the effectiveness of DeFT in both noisy label detection and image classification. Our source code can be found in the supplementary material."
Poster,Vision-Language Navigation with Energy-Based Policy,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93232,"Rui Liu, Wenguan Wang, Yi Yang","Vision-language navigation (VLN) requires an agent to execute actions following human instructions. Existing VLN models are optimized through expert demonstrations by supervised behavioural cloning or incorporating manual reward engineering. While straightforward, these efforts overlook the accumulation of errors in the Markov decision process, and struggle to match the distribution of the expert policy. Going beyond this, we propose an Energy-based Navigation Policy (ENP) to model the joint state-action distribution using an energy-based model. At each step, low energy values correspond to the state-action pairs that the expert is most likely to perform, and vice versa. Theoretically, the optimization objective is equivalent to minimizing the forward divergence between the occupancy measure of the expert and ours. Consequently, ENP learns to globally align with the expert policy by maximizing the likelihood of the actions and modeling the dynamics of the navigation states in a collaborative manner. With a variety of VLN architectures, ENP achieves promising performances on R2R, REVERIE, RxR, and R2R-CE, unleashing the power of existing VLN models."
