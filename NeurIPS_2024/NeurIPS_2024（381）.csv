Poster,S-SOS: Stochastic Sum-Of-Squares for Parametric Polynomial Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94021,"Licheng Zhu, Mathias Oster, Yuehaw Khoo","Global polynomial optimization is an important tool across applied mathematics, with many applications in operations research, engineering, and the physical sciences. In various settings, the polynomials depend on external parameters that may be random. We discuss a stochastic sum-of-squares (S-SOS) algorithm based on the sum-of-squares hierarchy that constructs a series of semidefinite programs to jointly find strict lower bounds on the global minimum and extracts candidates for parameterized global minimizers. We prove quantitative convergence of the hierarchy as the degree increases and use it to solve unconstrained and constrained polynomial optimization problems parameterized by random variables. By employing n-body priors from condensed matter physics to induce sparsity, we can use S-SOS to produce solutions and uncertainty intervals for sensor network localization problems containing up to 40 variables and semidefinite matrix sizes surpassing 800 x 800."
Poster,S-STE: Continuous Pruning Function for Efficient 2:4 Sparse Pre-training,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96363,"Yuezhou Hu, Jun Zhu, Jianfei Chen","Training deep neural networks (DNNs) is costly. Fortunately, Nvidia Ampere and Hopper GPUs can accelerate matrix multiplications twice as fast as a dense equivalent by implementing 2:4 sparsity. However, previous STE-based 2:4 pre-training methods (\eg~STE with hard-thresholding, SR-STE) suffer from optimization difficulties because of discontinuous pruning function.In this study, we comprehensively analyse the bottleneck of traditional N:M sparse training and recognize three drawbacks with discontinuity: incorrect descending direction, inability to predict the amount of descent and sparse mask oscillation. In the light of this statement, we propose S-STE, a simple yet powerful 2:4 training method that contains two parts: to continuously project weights to be 2:4 sparse, and to rescale sparse weights with a per-tensor fixed scaling factor. Besides, we adopt minimum-variance unbiased estimation for activation gradient and FP8 quantization for whole process. Results show that our method surpass previous 2:4 pre-training recipes and is comparable even with full parameter models."
Poster,ST$_k$: A Scalable Module for Solving Top-k Problems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95356,"Hanchen Xia, Weidong Liu, Xiaojun Mao","The cost of ranking becomes significant in the new stage of deep learning. We propose ST$_k$, a fully differentiable module with a single trainable parameter, designed to solve the Top-k problem without requiring additional time or GPU memory. Due to its fully differentiable nature, ST$_k$ can be embedded end-to-end into neural networks and optimize the Top-k problems within a unified computational graph. We apply ST$_k$ to the Average Top-k Loss (AT$_k$), which inherently faces a Top-k problem. The proposed ST$_k$ Loss outperforms AT$_k$ Loss and achieves the best average performance on multiple benchmarks, with the lowest standard deviation. With the assistance of ST$_k$ Loss, we surpass the state-of-the-art (SOTA) on both CIFAR-100-LT and Places-LT leaderboards."
Poster,Stability and Generalizability in SDE Diffusion Models with Measure-Preserving Dynamics,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94896,"Weitong Zhang, Chengqi Zang, Liu Li, Sarah Cechnicka, Cheng Ouyang, Bernhard Kainz","Inverse problems describe the process of estimating the causal factors from a set of measurements or data. Mapping of often incomplete or degraded data to parameters is ill-posed, thus data-driven iterative solutions are required, for example when reconstructing clean images from poor signals. Diffusion models have shown promise as potent generative tools for solving inverse problems due to their superior reconstruction quality and their compatibility with iterative solvers. However, most existing approaches are limited to linear inverse problems represented as Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). This simplification falls short of addressing the challenging nature of real-world problems, leading to amplified cumulative errors and biases. We provide an explanation for this gap through the lens of measure-preserving dynamics of Random Dynamical Systems (RDS) with which we analyse Temporal Distribution Discrepancy and thus introduce a theoretical framework based on RDS for SDE diffusion models. We uncover several strategies that inherently enhance the stability and generalizability of diffusion models for inverse problems and introduce a novel score-based diffusion framework, the Dynamics-aware SDE Diffusion Generative Model (D^3GM). The Measure-preserving property can return the degraded measurement to the original state despite complex degradation with the RDS concept of stability.Our extensive experimental results corroborate the effectiveness of D^3GM across multiple benchmarks including a prominent application for inverse problems, magnetic resonance imaging."
Poster,Stability and Generalization of Adversarial Training for Shallow Neural Networks with Smooth Activation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96315,"Kaibo Zhang, Yunjuan Wang, Raman Arora","Adversarial training has emerged as a popular approach for training models that are robust to inference-time adversarial attacks. However, our theoretical understanding of why and when it works remains limited. Prior work has offered generalization analysis of adversarial training, but they are either restricted to the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime or they make restrictive assumptions about data such as (noisy) linear separability or robust realizability. In this work, we study the stability and generalization of adversarial training for two-layer networks **without any data distribution assumptions** and **beyond the NTK regime**. Our findings suggest that for networks with *any given initialization* and *sufficiently large width*, the generalization bound can be effectively controlled via early stopping. We further improve the generalization bound by leveraging smoothing using Moreau’s envelope."
Poster,Stability and Generalization of Asynchronous SGD: Sharper Bounds Beyond Lipschitz and Smoothness,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94500,"Xiaoge Deng, Tao Sun, Shengwei Li, Dongsheng Li, Xicheng Lu","Asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) has evolved into an indispensable optimization algorithm for training modern large-scale distributed machine learning tasks. Therefore, it is imperative to explore the generalization performance of the ASGD algorithm. However, the existing results are either pessimistic and vacuous or restricted by strict assumptions that fail to reveal the intrinsic impact of asynchronous training on generalization. In this study, we establish sharper stability and generalization bounds for ASGD under much weaker assumptions. Firstly, this paper studies the on-average model stability of ASGD and provides a non-vacuous upper bound on the generalization error, without relying on the Lipschitz assumption. Furthermore, we investigate the excess generalization error of the ASGD algorithm, revealing the effects of asynchronous delay, model initialization, number of training samples and iterations on generalization performance. Secondly, for the first time, this study explores the generalization performance of ASGD in the non-smooth case. We replace smoothness with the much weaker Hölder continuous assumption and achieve similar generalization results as in the smooth case. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings by training numerous machine learning models, including convex problems and non-convex tasks in computer vision and natural language processing."
Poster,Stabilized Proximal-Point Methods for Federated Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94808,"Xiaowen Jiang, Anton Rodomanov, Sebastian Stich","In developing efficient optimization algorithms, it is crucial to account for communication constraints&mdash;a significant challenge in modern Federated Learning.     The best-known communication complexity among non-accelerated algorithms is achieved by DANE, a distributed proximal-point algorithm that solves local subproblems at each iteration and that can exploit second-order similarity among individual functions.    However, to achieve such communication efficiency, the algorithm    requires solving local subproblems sufficiently accurately resulting in slightly sub-optimal local complexity.    Inspired by the hybrid-projection proximal-point method, in this work, we propose a novel distributed algorithm S-DANE. Compared to DANE, this method uses an auxiliary sequence of prox-centers while maintaining the same deterministic communication complexity. Moreover, the accuracy condition for solving the subproblem is milder, leading to enhanced local computation efficiency. Furthermore, S-DANE supports partial client participation and arbitrary stochastic local solvers, making it attractive in practice. We further accelerate S-DANE and show that the resulting algorithm achieves the best-known communication complexity among all existing methods for distributed convex optimization while still enjoying good local computation efficiency as S-DANE.    Finally, we propose adaptive variants of both methods using line search, obtaining the first provably efficient adaptive algorithms that could exploit local second-order similarity without the prior knowledge of any parameters."
Poster,Stabilize the Latent Space for Image Autoregressive Modeling: A Unified Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93143,"Yongxin Zhu, Bocheng Li, Hang Zhang, Xin Li, Linli Xu, Lidong Bing","Latent-based image generative models, such as Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) and Mask Image Models (MIMs), have achieved notable success in image generation tasks. These models typically leverage reconstructive autoencoders like VQGAN or VAE to encode pixels into a more compact latent space and learn the data distribution in the latent space instead of directly from pixels. However, this practice raises a pertinent question: Is it truly the optimal choice? In response, we begin with an intriguing observation: despite sharing the same latent space, autoregressive models significantly lag behind LDMs and MIMs in image generation. This finding contrasts sharply with the field of NLP, where the autoregressive model GPT has established a commanding presence. To address this discrepancy, we introduce a unified perspective on the relationship between latent space and generative models, emphasizing the stability of latent space in image generative modeling. Furthermore, we propose a simple but effective discrete image tokenizer to stabilize the latent space for image generative modeling by applying K-Means on the latent features of self-supervised learning models. Experimental results show that image autoregressive modeling with our tokenizer (DiGIT) benefits both image understanding and image generation with the next token prediction principle, which is inherently straightforward for GPT models but challenging for other generative models. Remarkably, for the first time, a GPT-style autoregressive model for images outperforms LDMs, which also exhibits substantial improvement akin to GPT when scaling up model size. Our findings underscore the potential of an optimized latent space and the integration of discrete tokenization in advancing the capabilities of image generative models.

Poster,Stabilizing Linear Passive-Aggressive Online Learning with Weighted Reservoir Sampling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95981,"Skyler Wu, Fred Lu, Edward Raff, James Holt","Online learning methods, like the seminal Passive-Aggressive (PA) classifier, are still highly effective for high-dimensional streaming data, out-of-core processing, and other throughput-sensitive applications. Many such algorithms rely on fast adaptation to individual errors as a key to their convergence. While such algorithms enjoy low theoretical regret, in real-world deployment they can be sensitive to individual outliers that cause the algorithm to over-correct. When such outliers occur at the end of the data stream, this can cause the final solution to have unexpectedly low accuracy. We design a weighted reservoir sampling (WRS) approach to obtain a stable ensemble model from the sequence of solutions without requiring additional passes over the data, hold-out sets, or a growing amount of memory. Our key insight is that good solutions tend to be error-free for more iterations than bad solutions, and thus, the number of passive rounds provides an estimate of a solution's relative quality. Our reservoir thus contains $K$ previous intermediate weight vectors with high survival times. We demonstrate our WRS approach on the Passive-Aggressive Classifier (PAC) and First-Order Sparse Online Learning (FSOL), where our method consistently and significantly outperforms the unmodified approach. We show that the risk of the ensemble classifier is bounded with respect to the regret of the underlying online learning method."
Poster,Stabilizing Zero-Shot Prediction: A Novel Antidote to Forgetting in Continual Vision-Language Tasks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96161,"Zijian Gao, Xingxing Zhang, Kele Xu, Xinjun Mao, Huaimin Wang","Continual learning (CL) empowers pre-trained vision-language (VL) models to efficiently adapt to a sequence of downstream tasks. However, these models often encounter challenges in retaining previously acquired skills due to parameter shifts and limited access to historical data. In response, recent efforts focus on devising specific frameworks and various replay strategies, striving for a typical learning-forgetting trade-off. Surprisingly, both our empirical research and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the stability of the model in consecutive zero-shot predictions serves as a reliable indicator of its anti-forgetting capabilities for previously learned tasks. Motivated by these insights, we develop a novel replay-free CL method named ZAF (Zero-shot Antidote to Forgetting), which preserves acquired knowledge through a zero-shot stability regularization applied to wild data in a plug-and-play manner. To enhance efficiency in adapting to new tasks and seamlessly access historical models, we introduce a parameter-efficient EMA-LoRA neural architecture based on the Exponential Moving Average (EMA). ZAF utilizes new data for low-rank adaptation (LoRA), complemented by a zero-shot antidote on wild data, effectively decoupling learning from forgetting. Our extensive experiments demonstrate ZAF's superior performance and robustness in pre-trained models across various continual VL concept learning tasks, achieving leads of up to 3.70\%, 4.82\%, and 4.38\%, along with at least a 10x acceleration in training speed on three benchmarks, respectively. Additionally, our zero-shot antidote significantly reduces forgetting in existing models by at least 6.37\%.
