Poster,Paloma: A Benchmark for Evaluating Language Model Fit,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97430,"Ian Magnusson, Akshita Bhagia, Valentin Hofmann, Luca Soldaini, Ananya Harsh Jha, Oyvind Tafjord, Dustin Schwenk, Evan Walsh, Yanai Elazar, Kyle Lo, Dirk Groeneveld, Iz Beltagy, Hanna Hajishirzi, Noah Smith, Kyle Richardson, Jesse Dodge","Evaluations of language models (LMs) commonly report perplexity on monolithic data held out from training. Implicitly or explicitly, this data is composed of domains—varying distributions of language. We introduce Perplexity Analysis for Language Model Assessment (Paloma), a benchmark to measure LM fit to 546 English and code domains, instead of assuming perplexity on one distribution extrapolates to others. We include two new datasets of the top 100 subreddits (e.g., r/depression on Reddit) and programming languages (e.g., Java on GitHub), both sources common in contemporary LMs. With our benchmark, we release 6 baseline 1B LMs carefully controlled to provide fair comparisons about which pretraining corpus is best and code for others to apply those controls to their own experiments. Our case studies demonstrate how the fine-grained results from Paloma surface findings such as that models pretrained without data beyond Common Crawl exhibit anomalous gaps in LM fit to many domains or that loss is dominated by the most frequently occurring strings in the vocabulary."
Poster,Panacea: Pareto Alignment via Preference Adaptation for LLMs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94149,"Yifan Zhong, Chengdong Ma, Xiaoyuan Zhang, Ziran Yang, Haojun Chen, Qingfu Zhang, Siyuan Qi, Yaodong Yang","Current methods for large language model alignment typically use scalar human preference labels. However, this convention tends to oversimplify the multi-dimensional and heterogeneous nature of human preferences, leading to reduced expressivity and even misalignment. This paper presents Panacea, an innovative approach that reframes alignment as a multi-dimensional preference optimization problem. Panacea trains a single model capable of adapting online and Pareto-optimally to diverse sets of preferences without the need for further tuning. A major challenge here is using a low-dimensional preference vector to guide the model's behavior, despite it being governed by an overwhelmingly large number of parameters. To address this, Panacea is designed to use singular value decomposition (SVD)-based low-rank adaptation, which allows the preference vector to be simply injected online as singular values. Theoretically, we prove that Panacea recovers the entire Pareto front with common loss aggregation methods under mild conditions. Moreover, our experiments demonstrate, for the first time, the feasibility of aligning a single LLM to represent an exponentially vast spectrum of human preferences through various optimization methods. Our work marks a step forward in effectively and efficiently aligning models to diverse and intricate human preferences in a controllable and Pareto-optimal manner."
Poster,Pandora's Box: Towards Building Universal Attackers against Real-World Large Vision-Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94158,"Daizong Liu, Mingyu Yang, Xiaoye Qu, Pan Zhou, Xiang Fang, Keke Tang, Yao Wan, Lichao Sun","Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal understanding tasks. Nevertheless, these models are susceptible to adversarial examples. In real-world applications, existing LVLM attackers generally rely on the detailed prior knowledge of the model to generate effective perturbations. Moreover, these attacks are task-specific, leading to significant costs for designing perturbation. Motivated by the research gap and practical demands, in this paper, we make the first attempt to build a universal attacker against real-world LVLMs, focusing on two critical aspects: (i) restricting access to only the LVLM inputs and outputs. (ii) devising a universal adversarial patch, which is task-agnostic and can deceive any LVLM-driven task when applied to various inputs. Specifically, we start by initializing the location and the pattern of the adversarial patch through random sampling, guided by the semantic distance between their output and the target label. Subsequently, we maintain a consistent patch location while refining the pattern to enhance semantic resemblance to the target. In particular, our approach incorporates a diverse set of LVLM task inputs as query samples to approximate the patch gradient, capitalizing on the importance of distinct inputs. In this way, the optimized patch is universally adversarial against different tasks and prompts, leveraging solely gradient estimates queried from the model. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong universal adversarial capabilities of our proposed attack with prevalent LVLMs including LLaVA, MiniGPT-4, Flamingo, and BLIP-2, spanning a spectrum of tasks, all achieved without delving into the details of the model structures."
Poster,PANORAMIA: Privacy Auditing of Machine Learning Models without Retraining,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96581,"Mishaal Kazmi, Hadrien Lautraite, Alireza Akbari, Qiaoyue Tang, Mauricio Soroco, Tao Wang, Sébastien Gambs, Mathias Lécuyer","We present PANORAMIA, a privacy leakage measurement framework for machine learning models that relies on membership inference attacks using generated data as non-members. By relying on generated non-member data, PANORAMIA eliminates the common dependency of privacy measurement tools on in-distribution non-member data. As a result, PANORAMIA does not modify the model, training data, or training process, and only requires access to a subset of the training data. We evaluate PANORAMIA on ML models for image and tabular data classification, as well as on large-scale language models."
Poster,Paralinguistics-Aware Speech-Empowered Large Language Models for Natural Conversation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95416,"Heeseung Kim, Soonshin Seo, Kyeongseok Jeong, Ohsung Kwon, Soyoon Kim, Jungwhan Kim, Jaehong Lee, Eunwoo Song, Myungwoo Oh, Jung-Woo Ha, Sungroh Yoon, Kang Min Yoo","Recent work shows promising results in expanding the capabilities of large language models (LLM) to directly understand and synthesize speech. However, an LLM-based strategy for modeling spoken dialogs remains elusive, calling for further investigation. This paper introduces an extensive speech-text LLM framework, the Unified Spoken Dialog Model (USDM), designed to generate coherent spoken responses with naturally occurring prosodic features relevant to the given input speech without relying on explicit automatic speech recognition (ASR) or text-to-speech (TTS) systems. We have verified the inclusion of prosody in speech tokens that predominantly contain semantic information and have used this foundation to construct a prosody-infused speech-text model. Additionally, we propose a generalized speech-text pretraining scheme that enhances the capture of cross-modal semantics. To construct USDM, we fine-tune our speech-text model on spoken dialog data using a multi-step spoken dialog template that stimulates the chain-of-reasoning capabilities exhibited by the underlying LLM. Automatic and human evaluations on the DailyTalk dataset demonstrate that our approach effectively generates natural-sounding spoken responses, surpassing previous and cascaded baselines. Our code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/naver-ai/usdm."
Poster,Parallel Backpropagation for Shared-Feature Visualization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95371,"Alexander Lappe, Anna Bognár, Ghazaleh Ghamkahri Nejad, Albert Mukovskiy, Lucas Martini, Martin Giese, Rufin Vogels","High-level visual brain regions contain subareas in which neurons appear to respond more strongly to examples of a particular semantic category, like faces or bodies, rather than objects. However, recent work has shown that while this finding holds on average, some out-of-category stimuli also activate neurons in these regions. This may be due to visual features common among the preferred class also being present in other images. Here, we propose a deep-learning-based approach for visualizing these features. For each neuron, we identify relevant visual features driving its selectivity by modelling responses to images based on latent activations of a deep neural network. Given an out-of-category image which strongly activates the neuron, our method first identifies a reference image from the preferred category yielding a similar feature activation pattern. We then backpropagate latent activations of both images to the pixel level, while enhancing the identified shared dimensions and attenuating non-shared features. The procedure highlights image regions containing shared features driving responses of the model neuron. We apply the algorithm to novel recordings from body-selective regions in macaque IT cortex in order to understand why some images of objects excite these neurons. Visualizations reveal object parts which resemble parts of a macaque body, shedding light on neural preference of these objects."
Poster,ParallelEdits: Efficient Multi-Aspect Text-Driven Image Editing with Attention Grouping,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94435,"Mingzhen Huang, Jialing Cai, Shan Jia, Vishnu Lokhande, Siwei Lyu","Text-driven image synthesis has made significant advancements with the development of diffusion models, transforming how visual content is generated from text prompts. Despite these advances, text-driven image editing, a key area in computer graphics, faces unique challenges. A major challenge is making simultaneous edits across multiple objects or attributes. Applying these methods sequentially for multi-attribute edits increases computational demands and efficiency losses.     In this paper, we address these challenges with significant contributions. Our main contribution is the development of ParallelEdits, a method that seamlessly manages simultaneous edits across multiple attributes. In contrast to previous approaches, ParallelEdits not only preserves the quality of single attribute edits but also significantly improves the performance of multitasking edits. This is achieved through innovative attention distribution mechanism and multi-branch design that operates across several processing heads.     Additionally, we introduce the PIE-Bench++ dataset, an expansion of the original PIE-Bench dataset, to better support evaluating image-editing tasks involving multiple objects and attributes simultaneously. This dataset is a benchmark for evaluating text-driven image editing methods in multifaceted scenarios."
Poster,Parallelizing Linear Transformers with the Delta Rule over Sequence Length,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93040,"Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yu Zhang, Yikang Shen, Yoon Kim","Transformers with linear attention (i.e., linear transformers) and state-space models have recently been suggested as a viable linear-time alternative to transformers with softmax attention. However, these models still underperform transformers especially on tasks that require in-context retrieval. While more expressive variants of linear transformers which replace the additive update in linear transformers with the delta rule (DeltaNet) have been found to be more effective at associative recall, existing algorithms for training such models do not parallelize over sequence length and are thus inefficient to train on modern hardware. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for training linear transformers with the delta rule, which exploits a memory-efficient representation for computing products of Householder matrices. This algorithm allows us to scale up DeltaNet to standard language modeling settings. We train a 1.3B model for 100B tokens and find that it outperforms recent linear-time baselines such as Mamba and GLA in terms of perplexity and zero-shot performance on downstream tasks. We also experiment with two hybrid models which combine DeltaNet layers with (1) sliding-window attention layers every other layer or (2) two global attention layers, and find that these hybrids outperform strong transformer baselines."
Poster,Parallelizing Model-based Reinforcement Learning Over the Sequence Length,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95198,"Zirui Wang, Yue DENG, Junfeng Long, Yin Zhang","Recently, Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) methods have demonstrated stunning sample efficiency in various RL domains.However, achieving this extraordinary sample efficiency comes with additional training costs in terms of computations, memory, and training time.To address these challenges, we propose the **Pa**rallelized **Mo**del-based **R**einforcement **L**earning (**PaMoRL**) framework.PaMoRL introduces two novel techniques: the **P**arallel **W**orld **M**odel (**PWM**) and the **P**arallelized **E**ligibility **T**race **E**stimation (**PETE**) to parallelize both model learning and policy learning stages of current MBRL methods over the sequence length.Our PaMoRL framework is hardware-efficient and stable, and it can be applied to various tasks with discrete or continuous action spaces using a single set of hyperparameters.The empirical results demonstrate that the PWM and PETE within PaMoRL significantly increase training speed without sacrificing inference efficiency.In terms of sample efficiency, PaMoRL maintains an MBRL-level sample efficiency that outperforms other no-look-ahead MBRL methods and model-free RL methods, and it even exceeds the performance of planning-based MBRL methods and methods with larger networks in certain tasks."
Poster,Parameter Competition Balancing for Model Merging,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93855,"Guodong DU, Junlin Lee, Jing Li, Runhua Jiang, Yifei Guo, Shuyang Yu, Hanting Liu, Sim Kuan Goh, Ho-Kin Tang, Daojing He, Min Zhang","While fine-tuning pretrained models has become common practice, these models often underperform outside their specific domains. Recently developed model merging techniques enable the direct integration of multiple models, each fine-tuned for distinct tasks, into a single model. This strategy promotes multitasking capabilities without requiring retraining on the original datasets. However, existing methods fall short in addressing potential conflicts and complex correlations between tasks, especially in parameter-level adjustments, posing a challenge in effectively balancing parameter competition across various tasks. This paper introduces an innovative technique named **PCB-Merging** (Parameter Competition Balancing), a *lightweight* and *training-free* technique that adjusts the coefficients of each parameter for effective model merging. PCB-Merging employs intra-balancing to gauge parameter significance within individual tasks and inter-balancing to assess parameter similarities across different tasks. Parameters with low importance scores are dropped, and the remaining ones are rescaled to form the final merged model. We assessed our approach in diverse merging scenarios, including cross-task, cross-domain, and cross-training configurations, as well as out-of-domain generalization. The experimental results reveal that our approach achieves substantial performance enhancements across multiple modalities, domains, model sizes, number of tasks, fine-tuning forms, and large language models, outperforming existing model merging methods."
