Poster,Heterogeneity-Guided Client Sampling: Towards Fast and Efficient Non-IID Federated Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95808,"Huancheng Chen, Haris Vikalo","Statistical heterogeneity of data present at client devices in a federated learning (FL) system renders the training of a global model in such systems difficult. Particularly challenging are the settings where due to communication resource constraints only a small fraction of clients can participate in any given round of FL. Recent approaches to training a global model in FL systems with non-IID data have focused on developing client selection methods that aim to sample clients with more informative updates of the model. However, existing client selection techniques either introduce significant computation overhead or perform well only in the scenarios where clients have data with similar heterogeneity profiles. In this paper, we propose HiCS-FL (Federated Learning via Hierarchical Clustered Sampling), a novel client selection method in which the server estimates statistical heterogeneity of a client's data using the client’s update of the network’s output layer and relies on this information to cluster and sample the clients. We analyze the ability of the proposed techniques to compare heterogeneity of different datasets, and characterize convergence of the training process that deploys the introduced client selection method. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that in non-IID settings HiCS-FL achieves faster convergence than state-of-the-art FL client selection schemes. Notably, HiCS-FL drastically reduces computation cost compared to existing selection schemes and is adaptable to different heterogeneity scenarios."
Poster,HGDL: Heterogeneous Graph Label Distribution Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95338,"Yufei Jin, Heng Lian, Yi He, Xingquan Zhu","Label Distribution Learning (LDL) has been extensively studied in IID data applications such as computer vision, thanks to its more generic setting over single-label and multi-label classification. This paper advances LDL into graph domains and aims to tackle a novel and fundamentalheterogeneous graph label distribution learning (HGDL) problem.We argue that the graph heterogeneity reflected on node types, node attributes, and  neighborhood structures can impose significant challenges for generalizing LDL onto graphs. To address the challenges, we propose a new learning framework with two key components: 1) proactive graph topology homogenization, and 2) topology and content consistency-aware graph transformer. Specifically, the former learns optimal information aggregation between meta-paths, so that the nodeheterogeneity can be proactively addressed prior to the succeeding embedding learning; the latter leverages an attention mechanism to learn consistency between meta-path and node attributes, allowing network topology and nodal attributes to be equally emphasized during the label distribution learning. By using KL-divergence and additional constraints, \method~delivers an end-to-end solution for learning and predicting label distribution for nodes. Both theoretical and empirical studies substantiate the effectiveness of our HGDL approach.Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Listener-Watcher/HGDL."
Poster,HHD-GP: Incorporating Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition into Gaussian Processes for Learning Dynamical Systems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95052,"Hao Xu, Jia Pan","Machine learning models provide alternatives for efficiently recognizing complex patterns from data, but the main concern in applying them to modeling physical systems stems from their physics-agnostic design, leading to learning methods that lack interpretability, robustness, and data efficiency. This paper mitigates this concern by incorporating the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition into a Gaussian process model, leading to a versatile framework that simultaneously learns the curl-free and divergence-free components of a dynamical system. Learning a predictive model in this form facilitates the exploitation of symmetry priors. In addition to improving predictive power, these priors make the model indentifiable, thus the identified features can be linked to comprehensible scientific properties of the system. We show that compared to baseline models, our model achieves better predictive performance on several benchmark dynamical systems while allowing physically meaningful decomposition of the systems from noisy and sparse data."
Poster,HiCo: Hierarchical Controllable Diffusion Model for Layout-to-image Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94025,"Bocheng, Yuhang Ma, wuliebucha, Shanyuan Liu, Ao Ma, Xiaoyu Wu, Dawei Leng, Yuhui Yin","The task of layout-to-image generation involves synthesizing images based on the captions of objects and their spatial positions. Existing methods still struggle in complex layout generation, where common bad cases include object missing, inconsistent lighting, conflicting view angles, etc. To effectively address these issues, we propose a \textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{Co}ntrollable (HiCo) diffusion model for layout-to-image generation, featuring object seperable conditioning branch structure. Our key insight is to achieve spatial disentanglement through hierarchical modeling of layouts. We use a multi branch structure to represent hierarchy and aggregate them in fusion module. To evaluate the performance of multi-objective controllable layout generation in natural scenes, we introduce the HiCo-7K benchmark, derived from the GRIT-20M dataset and manually cleaned. https://github.com/360CVGroup/HiCo_T2I."
Poster,HiCoM: Hierarchical Coherent Motion for Dynamic Streamable Scenes with 3D Gaussian Splatting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96081,"Qiankun Gao, Jiarui Meng, Chengxiang Wen, Jie Chen, Jian Zhang","The online reconstruction of dynamic scenes from multi-view streaming videos faces significant challenges in training, rendering and storage efficiency. Harnessing superior learning speed and real-time rendering capabilities, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently demonstrated considerable potential in this field. However, 3DGS can be inefficient in terms of storage and prone to overfitting by excessively growing Gaussians, particularly with limited views. This paper proposes an efficient framework, dubbed HiCoM, with three key components. First, we construct a compact and robust initial 3DGS representation using a perturbation smoothing strategy. Next, we introduce a Hierarchical Coherent Motion mechanism that leverages the inherent non-uniform distribution and local consistency of 3D Gaussians to swiftly and accurately learn motions across frames. Finally, we continually refine the 3DGS with additional Gaussians, which are later merged into the initial 3DGS to maintain consistency with the evolving scene. To preserve a compact representation, an equivalent number of low-opacity Gaussians that minimally impact the representation are removed before processing subsequent frames. Extensive experiments conducted on two widely used datasets show that our framework improves learning efficiency of the state-of-the-art methods by about 20% and reduces the data storage by 85%, achieving competitive free-viewpoint video synthesis quality but with higher robustness and stability. Moreover, by parallel learning multiple frames simultaneously, our HiCoM decreases the average training wall time to <2 seconds per frame with negligible performance degradation, substantially boosting real-world applicability and responsiveness."
Poster,Hidden in Plain Sight: Evaluating Abstract Shape Recognition in Vision-Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97667,"Arshia Hemmat, Adam Davies, Tom Lamb, Jianhao Yuan, Philip Torr, Ashkan Khakzar, Francesco Pinto","Despite the importance of shape perception in human vision, early neural image classifiers relied less on shape information for object recognition than other (often spurious) features. While recent research suggests that current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit more reliance on shape, we find them to still be seriously limited in this regard. To quantify such limitations, we introduce IllusionBench, a dataset that challenges current cutting-edge VLMs to decipher shape information when the shape is represented by an arrangement of visual elements in a scene. Our extensive evaluations reveal that, while these shapes are easily detectable by human annotators, current VLMs struggle to recognize them, indicating important avenues for future work in developing more robust visual perception systems.

Poster,Hierarchical and Density-based Causal Clustering,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96587,"Kwangho Kim, Jisu Kim, Larry Wasserman, Edward Kennedy","Understanding treatment effect heterogeneity is vital for scientific and policy research. However, identifying and evaluating heterogeneous treatment effects pose significant challenges due to the typically unknown subgroup structure. Recently, a novel approach, causal k-means clustering, has emerged to assess heterogeneity of treatment effect by applying the k-means algorithm to unknown counterfactual regression functions. In this paper, we expand upon this framework by integrating hierarchical and density-based clustering algorithms. We propose plug-in estimators which are simple and readily implementable using off-the-shelf algorithms. Unlike k-means clustering, which requires the margin condition, our proposed estimators do not rely on strong structural assumptions on the outcome process. We go on to study their rate of convergence, and show that under the minimal regularity conditions, the additional cost of causal clustering is essentially the estimation error of the outcome regression functions. Our findings significantly extend the capabilities of the causal clustering framework, thereby contributing to the progression of methodologies for identifying homogeneous subgroups in treatment response, consequently facilitating more nuanced and targeted interventions. The proposed methods also open up new avenues for clustering with generic pseudo-outcomes. We explore finite sample properties via simulation, and illustrate the proposed methods in voting and employment projection datasets."
Poster,Hierarchical Federated Learning with Multi-Timescale Gradient Correction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94577,"Wenzhi Fang, Dong-Jun Han, Evan Chen, Shiqiang Wang, Christopher Brinton","While traditional federated learning (FL) typically focuses on a star topology where clients are directly connected to a central server, real-world distributed systems often exhibit hierarchical architectures. Hierarchical FL (HFL) has emerged as a promising solution to bridge this gap, leveraging aggregation points at multiple levels of the system. However, existing algorithms for HFL encounter challenges in dealing with multi-timescale model drift, i.e., model drift occurring across hierarchical levels of data heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a multi-timescale gradient correction (MTGC) methodology to resolve this issue. Our key idea is to introduce distinct control variables to (i) correct the client gradient towards the group gradient, i.e., to reduce client model drift caused by local updates based on individual datasets, and (ii) correct the group gradient towards the global gradient, i.e., to reduce group model drift caused by FL over clients within the group. We analytically characterize the convergence behavior of MTGC under general non-convex settings, overcoming challenges associated with couplings between correction terms. We show that our convergence bound is immune to the extent of data heterogeneity, confirming the stability of the proposed algorithm against multi-level non-i.i.d. data. Through extensive experiments on various datasets and models, we validate the effectiveness of MTGC in diverse HFL settings. The code for this project is available at https://github.com/wenzhifang/MTGC."
Poster,Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein: A Scalable Metric for Heterogeneous Joint Distributions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94735,"Khai Nguyen, Nhat Ho","Sliced Wasserstein (SW) and Generalized Sliced Wasserstein (GSW) have been widely used in applications due to their computational and statistical scalability. However, the SW and the GSW are only defined between distributions supported on a homogeneous domain. This limitation prevents their usage in applications with heterogeneous joint distributions with marginal distributions supported on multiple different domains. Using SW and GSW directly on the joint domains cannot make a meaningful comparison since their homogeneous slicing operator, i.e., Radon Transform (RT) and Generalized Radon Transform (GRT) are not expressive enough to capture the structure of the joint supports set. To address the issue, we propose two new slicing operators, i.e., Partial Generalized Radon Transform (PGRT) and Hierarchical Hybrid Radon Transform (HHRT). In greater detail, PGRT is the generalization of Partial Radon Transform (PRT), which transforms a subset of function arguments non-linearly while HHRT is the composition of PRT and multiple domain-specific PGRT on marginal domain arguments. By using HHRT, we extend the SW into Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein (H2SW) distance which is designed specifically for comparing heterogeneous joint distributions. We then discuss the topological, statistical, and computational properties of H2SW. Finally, we demonstrate the favorable performance of H2SW in 3D mesh deformation, deep 3D mesh autoencoders, and datasets comparison."
Poster,Hierarchical Object-Aware Dual-Level Contrastive Learning for Domain Generalized Stereo Matching,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95820,"Yikun Miao, Meiqing Wu, Siew Kei Lam, Changsheng Li, Thambipillai Srikanthan","Stereo matching algorithms that leverage end-to-end convolutional neural networks have recently demonstrated notable advancements in performance. However, a common issue is their susceptibility to domain shifts, hindering their ability in generalizing to diverse, unseen realistic domains. We argue that existing stereo matching networks overlook the importance of extracting semantically and structurally meaningful features. To address this gap, we propose an effective hierarchical object-aware dual-level contrastive learning (HODC) framework for domain generalized stereo matching. Our framework guides the model in extracting features that support semantically and structurally driven matching by segmenting objects at different scales and enhances correspondence between intra- and inter-scale regions from the left feature map to the right using dual-level contrastive loss. HODC can be integrated with existing stereo matching models in the training stage, requiring no modifications to the architecture. Remarkably, using only synthetic datasets for training, HODC achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance with various existing stereo matching network architectures, across multiple realistic datasets."
