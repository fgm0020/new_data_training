Poster,Decision Mamba: Reinforcement Learning via Hybrid Selective Sequence Modeling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93166,"Sili Huang, Jifeng Hu, Zhejian Yang, Liwei Yang, Tao Luo, Hechang Chen, Lichao Sun, Bo Yang","Recent works have shown the remarkable superiority of transformer models in reinforcement learning (RL), where the decision-making problem is formulated as sequential generation. Transformer-based agents could emerge with self-improvement in online environments by providing task contexts, such as multiple trajectories, called in-context RL. However, due to the quadratic computation complexity of attention in transformers, current in-context RL methods suffer from huge computational costs as the task horizon increases. In contrast, the Mamba model is renowned for its efficient ability to process long-term dependencies, which provides an opportunity for in-context RL to solve tasks that require long-term memory. To this end, we first implement Decision Mamba (DM) by replacing the backbone of Decision Transformer (DT). Then, we propose a Decision Mamba-Hybrid (DM-H) with the merits of transformers and Mamba in high-quality prediction and long-term memory. Specifically, DM-H first generates high-value sub-goals from long-term memory through the Mamba model. Then, we use sub-goals to prompt the transformer, establishing high-quality predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that DM-H achieves state-of-the-art in long and short-term tasks, such as D4RL, Grid World, and Tmaze benchmarks. Regarding efficiency, the online testing of DM-H in the long-term task is 28$\times$ times faster than the transformer-based baselines."
Poster,DECO-Bench: Unified Benchmark for Decoupled Task-Agnostic Synthetic Data Release,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97625,"Farzaneh Askari, Lingjuan Lyu, Vivek Sharma","In this work, we tackle the question of how to systematically benchmark task-agnostic decoupling methods for privacy-preserving machine learning (ML). Sharing datasets that include sensitive information often triggers privacy concerns, necessitating robust decoupling methods to separate sensitive and non-sensitive attributes. Despite the development of numerous decoupling techniques, a standard benchmark for systematically comparing these methods remains absent. Our framework integrates various decoupling techniques along with synthetic datageneration and evaluation protocols within a unified system. Using our framework, we benchmark various decoupling techniques and evaluate their privacy-utility trade-offs. Finally, we release our source code, pre-trained models, datasets of decoupled representations to foster research in this area."
Poster,Decoding-Time Language Model Alignment with Multiple Objectives,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96731,"Ruizhe Shi, Yifang Chen, Yushi Hu, Alisa Liu, Hanna Hajishirzi, Noah Smith, Simon Du","Aligning language models (LMs) to human preferences has emerged as a critical pursuit, enabling these models to better serve diverse user needs. Existing methods primarily focus on optimizing LMs for a single reward function, limiting their adaptability to varied objectives. Here, we propose $\textbf{multi-objective decoding~(MOD)}$, a decoding-time algorithm that outputs the next token from a linear combination of predictions of all base models, for any given weighting over different objectives.We exploit a common form among a family of $f$-divergence regularized alignment approaches (such as PPO, DPO, and their variants) to identify a closed-form solution by Legendre transform, and derive an efficient decoding strategy.Theoretically, we show why existing approaches can be sub-optimal even in natural settings and obtain optimality guarantees for our method.Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. For example, compared to a parameter-merging baseline, MOD achieves 12.8\% overall reward improvement when equally optimizing towards $3$ objectives. Moreover, we experiment with MOD on combining three fully-finetuned LMs of different model sizes, each aimed at different objectives such as safety, coding, and general user preference. Unlike traditional methods that require careful curation of a mixture of datasets to achieve comprehensive improvement, we can quickly experiment with preference weightings using MOD to find the best combination of models. Our best combination reduces toxicity on Toxigen to nearly 0\% and achieves 7.9--33.3\% improvement across three other metrics ($\textit{i.e.}$, Codex@1, GSM-COT, BBH-COT)."
Poster,Decomposable Transformer Point Processes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95355,Aristeidis Panos,"The standard paradigm of modeling marked point processes is by parameterizing the intensity function using an attention-based (Transformer-style) architecture. Despite the flexibility of these methods, their inference is based on the computationally intensive thinning algorithm. In this work, we propose a framework where the advantages of the attention-based architecture are maintained and the limitation of the thinning algorithm is circumvented. The framework depends on modeling the conditional distribution of inter-event times with a mixture of log-normals satisfying a Markov property and the conditional probability mass function for the marks with a Transformer-based architecture. The proposed method attains state-of-the-art performance in predicting the next event of a sequence given its history. The experiments also reveal the efficacy of the methods that do not rely on the thinning algorithm during inference over the ones they do. Finally, we test our method on the challenging long-horizon prediction task and find that it outperforms a baseline developed specifically for tackling this task; importantly, inference requires just a fraction of time compared to the thinning-based baseline."
Poster,"Decompose, Analyze and Rethink: Solving Intricate Problems with Human-like Reasoning Cycle",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95441,"Shangzi Xue, Zhenya Huang, Jiayu Liu, Xin Lin, Yuting Ning, Binbin Jin, Xin Li, Qi Liu","In this paper, we introduce DeAR (_Decompose-Analyze-Rethink_), a framework that iteratively builds a reasoning tree to tackle intricate problems within a single large language model (LLM). Unlike approaches that extend or search for rationales, DeAR is featured by 1) adopting a tree-based question decomposition manner to plan the organization of rationales, which mimics the logical planning inherentin human cognition; 2) globally updating the rationales at each reasoning step through natural language feedback. Specifically, the _Decompose_ stage decomposes the question into simpler sub-questions, storing them as new nodes; the _Analyze_ stage generates and self-checks rationales for sub-questions at each node evel; and the _Rethink_ stage updates parent-node rationales based on feedback from their child nodes. By generating and updating the reasoning process from a more global perspective, DeAR constructs more adaptive and accurate logical structures for complex problems, facilitating timely error correction compared to rationale-extension and search-based approaches such as Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) and Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT). We conduct extensive experiments on three reasoning benchmarks, including ScienceQA, StrategyQA, and GSM8K, which cover a variety of reasoning tasks, demonstrating that our approach significantly reduces logical errors and enhances performance across various LLMs. Furthermore, we validate that DeAR is an efficient method that achieves a superior trade-off between accuracy and reasoning time compared to ToT and GoT."
Poster,Decomposed Prompt Decision Transformer for Efficient Unseen Task Generalization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95819,"Hongling Zheng, Li Shen, Yong Luo, Tongliang Liu, Jialie Shen, Dacheng Tao","Multi-task offline reinforcement learning aims to develop a unified policy for diverse tasks without requiring real-time interaction with the environment. Recent work explores sequence modeling, leveraging the scalability of the transformer architecture as a foundation for multi-task learning. Given the variations in task content and complexity, formulating policies becomes a challenging endeavor, requiring careful parameter sharing and adept management of conflicting gradients to extract rich cross-task knowledge from multiple tasks and transfer it to unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose the Decomposed Prompt Decision Transformer (DPDT) that adopts a two-stage paradigm to efficiently learn prompts for unseen tasks in a parameter-efficient manner. We incorporate parameters from pre-trained language models (PLMs) to initialize DPDT, thereby providing rich prior knowledge encoded in language models. During the decomposed prompt tuning phase, we learn both cross-task and task-specific prompts on training tasks to achieve prompt decomposition. In the test time adaptation phase, the cross-task prompt, serving as a good initialization, were further optimized on unseen tasks through test time adaptation, enhancing the model's performance on these tasks. Empirical evaluation on a series of Meta-RL benchmarks demonstrates the superiority of our approach. The project is available at https://github.com/ruthless-man/DPDT."
Poster,Decomposing and Interpreting Image Representations via Text in ViTs Beyond CLIP,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94881,"Sriram Balasubramanian, Samyadeep Basu, Soheil Feizi","Recent work has explored how individual components of the CLIP-ViT model contribute to the final representation by leveraging the shared image-text representation space of CLIP.  These components, such as attention heads and MLPs, have been shown to capture distinct image features like shape, color or texture. However, understanding the role of these components in arbitrary vision transformers (ViTs) is challenging. To this end, we introduce a general framework which can identify the roles of various components in ViTs beyond CLIP. Specifically, we (a) automate the decomposition of the final representation into contributions from different model components, and (b) linearly map these contributions to CLIP space to interpret them via text. Additionally, we introduce a novel scoring function to rank components by their importance with respect to specific features.Applying our framework to various ViT variants (e.g. DeiT, DINO, DINOv2, Swin, MaxViT), we gain insights into the roles of different components concerning particular image features. These insights facilitate applications such as image retrieval using text descriptions or reference images, visualizing token importance heatmaps, and mitigating spurious correlations. We release our [code](https://github.com/SriramB-98/vit-decompose) to reproduce the experiments in the paper."
Poster,Decoupled Kullback-Leibler Divergence Loss,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94462,"Jiequan Cui, Zhuotao Tian, Zhisheng Zhong, Xiaojuan Qi, Bei Yu, Hanwang Zhang","In this paper, we delve deeper into the Kullback–Leibler (KL) Divergence loss and mathematically prove that it is equivalent to the Decoupled Kullback-Leibler (DKL) Divergence loss that consists of 1) a weighted Mean Square Error ($\mathbf{w}$MSE) loss and 2) a Cross-Entropy loss incorporating soft labels. Thanks to the decomposed formulation of DKL loss, we have identified two areas for improvement. Firstly, we address the limitation of KL/DKL in scenarios like knowledge distillation by breaking its asymmetric optimization property. This modification ensures that the $\mathbf{w}$MSE component is always effective during training, providing extra constructive cues.Secondly, we introduce class-wise global information into KL/DKL to mitigate bias from individual samples.With these two enhancements, we derive the Improved Kullback–Leibler (IKL) Divergence loss and evaluate its effectiveness by conducting experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets, focusing on adversarial training, and knowledge distillation tasks. The proposed approach achieves new state-of-the-art adversarial robustness on the public leaderboard --- \textit{RobustBench} and competitive performance on knowledge distillation, demonstrating the substantial practical merits. Our code is available at https://github.com/jiequancui/DKL."
Poster,Decoupling Semantic Similarity from Spatial Alignment for Neural Networks.,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92991,"Tassilo Wald, Constantin Ulrich, Priyank Jaini, Gregor Koehler, David Zimmerer, Stefan Denner, Fabian Isensee, Michael Baumgartner, Klaus Maier-Hein","What representation do deep neural networks learn? How similar are images to each other for neural networks? Despite the overwhelming success of deep learning methods key questions about their internal workings still remain largely unanswered, due to their internal high dimensionality and complexity. To address this, one approach is to measure the similarity of activation responses to various inputs.Representational Similarity Matrices (RSMs) distill this similarity into scalar values for each input pair.These matrices encapsulate the entire similarity structure of a system, indicating which input lead to similar responses.While the similarity between images is ambiguous, we argue that the spatial location of semantic objects does neither influence human perception nor deep learning classifiers. Thus this should be reflected in the definition of similarity between image responses for computer vision systems. Revisiting the established similarity calculations for RSMs we expose their sensitivity to spatial alignment. In this paper we propose to solve this through _semantic RSMs_, which are invariant to spatial permutation. We measure semantic similarity between input responses by formulating it as a set-matching problem. Further, we quantify the superiority of  _semantic_ RSMs over _spatio-semantic_ RSMs through image retrieval and by comparing the similarity between representations to the similarity between predicted class probabilities."
Poster,DECRL: A Deep Evolutionary Clustering Jointed Temporal Knowledge Graph Representation Learning Approach,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94926,"Qian Chen, Ling Chen","Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) representation learning aims to map temporal evolving entities and relations to embedded representations in a continuous low-dimensional vector space. However, existing approaches cannot capture the temporal evolution of high-order correlations in TKGs. To this end, we propose a **D**eep **E**volutionary **C**lustering jointed temporal knowledge graph **R**epresentation **L**earning approach (**DECRL**). Specifically, a deep evolutionary clustering module is proposed to capture the temporal evolution of high-order correlations among entities. Furthermore, a cluster-aware unsupervised alignment mechanism is introduced to ensure the precise one-to-one alignment of soft overlapping clusters across timestamps, thereby maintaining the temporal smoothness of clusters. In addition, an implicit correlation encoder is introduced to capture latent correlations between any pair of clusters under the guidance of a global graph. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that DECRL achieves the state-of-the-art performances, outperforming the best baseline by an average of 9.53\%, 12.98\%, 10.42\%, and 14.68\% in MRR, Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10, respectively."
