Poster,Handling Learnwares from Heterogeneous Feature Spaces with Explicit Label Exploitation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96738,"Peng Tan, Hai-Tian Liu, Zhi-Hao Tan, Zhi-Hua Zhou","The learnware paradigm aims to help users leverage numerous existing high-performing models instead of starting from scratch, where a learnware consists of a well-trained model and the specification describing its capability. Numerous learnwares are accommodated by a learnware dock system. When users solve tasks with the system, models that fully match the task feature space are often rare or even unavailable. However, models with heterogeneous feature space can still be helpful. This paper finds that label information, particularly model outputs, is helpful yet previously less exploited in the accommodation of heterogeneous learnwares. We extend the specification to better leverage model pseudo-labels and subsequently enrich the unified embedding space for better specification evolvement. With label information, the learnware identification can also be improved by additionally comparing conditional distributions. Experiments demonstrate that, even without a model explicitly tailored to user tasks, the system can effectively handle tasks by leveraging models from diverse feature spaces."
Poster,Happy: A Debiased Learning Framework for Continual Generalized Category Discovery,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94052,"Shijie Ma, Fei Zhu, Zhun Zhong, Wenzhuo Liu, Xu-yao Zhang, Cheng-lin Liu","Constantly discovering novel concepts is crucial in evolving environments. This paper explores the underexplored task of Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD), which aims to incrementally discover new classes from *unlabeled* data while maintaining the ability to recognize previously learned classes. Although several settings are proposed to study the C-GCD task, they have limitations that do not reflect real-world scenarios. We thus study a more practical C-GCD setting, which includes more new classes to be discovered over a longer period, without storing samples of past classes. In C-GCD, the model is initially trained on labeled data of known classes, followed by multiple incremental stages where the model is fed with unlabeled data containing both old and new classes. The core challenge involves two conflicting objectives: discover new classes and prevent forgetting old ones. We delve into the conflicts and identify that models are susceptible to *prediction bias* and *hardness bias*. To address these issues, we introduce a debiased learning framework, namely **Happy**, characterized by **H**ardness-**a**ware **p**rototype sampling and soft entro**py** regularization. For the *prediction bias*, we first introduce clustering-guided initialization to provide robust features. In addition, we propose soft entropy regularization to assign appropriate probabilities to new classes, which can significantly enhance the clustering performance of new classes. For the *harness bias*, we present the hardness-aware prototype sampling, which can effectively reduce the forgetting issue for previously seen classes, especially for difficult classes. Experimental results demonstrate our method proficiently manages the conflicts of C-GCD and achieves remarkable performance across various datasets, e.g., 7.5% overall gains on ImageNet-100.

Poster,HardCore Generation: Generating Hard UNSAT Problems for Data Augmentation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93671,"Joseph Cotnareanu, Zhanguang Zhang, Hui-Ling Zhen, Yingxue Zhang, Mark Coates","Efficiently determining the satisfiability of a boolean equation --- known as the SAT problem for brevity --- is crucial in various industrial problems.  Recently, the advent of deep learning methods has introduced significant potential for enhancing SAT solving. However, a major barrier to the advancement of this field has been the scarcity of large, realistic datasets.  The majority of current public datasets are either randomly generated or extremely limited, containing only a few examples from unrelated problem families. These datasets are inadequate for meaningful training of deep learning methods.  In light of this, researchers have started exploring generative techniques to create data that more accurately reflect SAT problems encountered in practical situations. These methods have so far suffered from either the inability to produce challenging SAT problems or time-scalability obstacles.  In this paper we address both by identifying and manipulating the key contributors to a problem's ``hardness'', known as cores. Although some previous work has addressed cores, the time costs are unacceptably high due to the expense of traditional heuristic core detection techniques. We introduce a fast core detection procedure that uses a graph neural network. Our empirical results demonstrate that we can efficiently generate problems that remain hard to solve and retain key attributes of the original example problems. We show via experiment that the generated synthetic SAT problems can be used in a data augmentation setting to provide improved prediction of solver runtimes."
Poster,Hardness of Learning Neural Networks under the Manifold Hypothesis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94321,"Bobak Kiani, Jason Wang, Melanie Weber","The manifold hypothesis presumes that high-dimensional data lies on or near a low-dimensional manifold. While the utility of encoding geometric structure has been demonstrated empirically, rigorous analysis of its impact on the learnability of neural networks is largely missing. Several recent results have established hardness results for learning feedforward and equivariant neural networks under i.i.d. Gaussian or uniform Boolean data distributions. In this paper, we investigate the hardness of learning under the manifold hypothesis. We ask, which minimal assumptions on the curvature and regularity of the manifold, if any, render the learning problem efficiently learnable. We prove that learning is hard under input manifolds of bounded curvature by extending proofs of hardness in the SQ and cryptographic settings for boolean data inputs to the geometric setting. On the other hand, we show that additional assumptions on the volume of the data manifold alleviate these fundamental limitations and guarantee learnability via a simple interpolation argument. Notable instances of this regime are manifolds which can be reliably reconstructed via manifold learning. Looking forward, we comment on and empirically explore intermediate regimes of manifolds, which have heterogeneous features commonly found in real world data."
Poster,HARMONIC: Harnessing LLMs for Tabular Data Synthesis and Privacy Protection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97571,"Yuxin Wang, Duanyu Feng, Yongfu Dai, Zhengyu Chen, Jimin Huang, Sophia Ananiadou, Qianqian Xie, Hao Wang","Data serves as the fundamental basis for advancing deep learning. The tabular data presented in a structured format is highly valuable for modeling and training.However, even in the era of LLM, obtaining tabular data from sensitive domains remains a challenge due to privacy or copyright concerns. Therefore, exploring the methods for effectively using models like LLMs to generate synthetic tabular data, which is privacy-preserving but similar to original one, is urgent.In this paper, we introduce a new framework HARMONIC for tabular data generation and evaluation by LLMs. In the data generation part of our framework, we employ fine-tuning to generate tabular data and enhance privacy rather than continued pre-training which is often used by previous small-scale LLM-based methods. In particular, we construct an instruction fine-tuning dataset based on the idea of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to inspire LLMs to discover inter-row relationships. By such fine-tuning, LLMs are trained to remember the format and connections of the data rather than the data itself, which reduces the risk of privacy leakage. The experiments find that our tabular data generation achieves equivalent performance as existing methods but with better privacy by the metric of MLE, DCR, etc.In the evaluation part of our framework, we develop a specific privacy risk metric DLT for LLM synthetic data generation, which quantifies the extent to which the generator itself leaks data. We also developed LLE, a performance evaluation metric for downstream LLM tasks, which is more practical and credible than previous metrics.The experiments show that our data generation method outperform the previous methods in the metrics DLT and LLE."
Poster,Harmonizing Stochasticity and Determinism: Scene-responsive Diverse Human Motion Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95438,"Zhenyu Lou, Qiongjie Cui, Tuo Wang, Zhenbo Song, Luoming Zhang, Cheng Cheng, Haofan Wang, Xu Tang, Huaxia Li, Hong Zhou","Diverse human motion prediction (HMP) is a fundamental application in computer vision that has recently attracted considerable interest. Prior methods primarily focus on the stochastic nature of human motion, while neglecting the specific impact of external environment, leading to the pronounced artifacts in prediction when applied to real-world scenarios. To fill this gap, this work introduces a novel task: predicting diverse human motion within real-world 3D scenes. In contrast to prior works, it requires harmonizing the deterministic constraints imposed by the surrounding 3D scenes with the stochastic aspect of human motion. For this purpose, we propose DiMoP3D, a diverse motion prediction framework with 3D scene awareness, which leverages the 3D point cloud and observed sequence to generate diverse and high-fidelity predictions. DiMoP3D is able to comprehend the 3D scene, and determines the probable target objects and their desired interactive pose based on the historical motion. Then, it plans the obstacle-free trajectory towards these interested objects, and generates diverse and physically-consistent future motions. On top of that, DiMoP3D identifies deterministic factors in the scene and integrates them into the stochastic modeling, making the diverse HMP in realistic scenes become a controllable stochastic generation process. On two real-captured benchmarks, DiMoP3D has demonstrated significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness in generating diverse and physically-consistent motion predictions within real-world 3D environments."
Poster,Harmonizing Visual Text Comprehension and Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94183,"Zhen Zhao, Jingqun Tang, Binghong Wu, Chunhui Lin, Shu Wei, Hao Liu, Xin Tan, zhizhong zhang, Can Huang, Yuan Xie","In this work, we present TextHarmony, a unified and versatile multimodal generative model proficient in comprehending and generating visual text. Simultaneously generating images and texts typically results in performance degradation due to the inherent inconsistency between vision and language modalities. To overcome this challenge, existing approaches resort to modality-specific data for supervised fine-tuning, necessitating distinct model instances. We propose Slide-LoRA, which dynamically aggregates modality-specific and modality-agnostic LoRA experts, partially decoupling the multimodal generation space. Slide-LoRA harmonizes the generation of vision and language within a singular model instance, thereby facilitating a more unified generative process. Additionally, we develop a high-quality image caption dataset, DetailedTextCaps-100K, synthesized with a sophisticated closed-source MLLM to enhance visual text generation capabilities further. Comprehensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Empowered by Slide-LoRA, TextHarmony achieves comparable performance to modality-specific fine-tuning results with only a 2% increase in parameters and shows an average improvement of 2.5% in visual text comprehension tasks and 4.0% in visual text generation tasks. Our work delineates the viability of an integrated approach to multimodal generation within the visual text domain, setting a foundation for subsequent inquiries.

Poster,Harmony4D: A Video Dataset for In-The-Wild Close Human Interactions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97726,"Rawal Khirodkar, Jyun-Ting Song, Jinkun Cao, Zhengyi Luo, Kris Kitani","Understanding how humans interact with each other is key to building realistic multi-human virtual reality systems. This area remains relatively unexplored due to the lack of large-scale datasets. Recent datasets focusing on this issue mainly consist of activities captured entirely in controlled indoor environments with choreographed actions, significantly affecting their diversity. To address this, we introduce Harmony4D, a multi-view video dataset for human-human interaction featuring in-the-wild activities such as wrestling, dancing, MMA,and more. We use a flexible multi-view capture system to record these dynamic activities and provide annotations for human detection, tracking, 2D/3D pose estimation, and mesh recovery for closely interacting subjects. We propose a novel markerless algorithm to track 3D human poses in severe occlusion and close interaction to obtain our annotations with minimal manual intervention. Harmony4D consists of 1.66 million images and 3.32 million human instances from more than 20 synchronized cameras with 208 video sequences spanning diverse environments and 24 unique subjects. We rigorously evaluate existing state-of-the-art methods for mesh recovery and highlight their significant limitations in modeling close interaction scenarios. Additionally, we fine-tune a pre-trained HMR2.0 model on Harmony4D and demonstrate an improved performance of 54.8% PVE in scenes with severe occlusion and contact. “Harmony—a cohesive alignment of human behaviors.""

Poster,Harnessing Multiple Correlated Networks for Exact Community Recovery,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96468,"Miklos Z. Racz, Jifan Zhang","We study the problem of learning latent community structure from multiple correlated networks, focusing on edge-correlated stochastic block models with two balanced communities. Recent work of Gaudio, Rácz, and Sridhar (COLT 2022) determined the precise information-theoretic threshold for exact community recovery using two correlated graphs; in particular, this showcased the subtle interplay between community recovery and graph matching. Here we study the natural setting of more than two graphs. The main challenge lies in understanding how to aggregate information across several graphs when none of the pairwise latent vertex correspondences can be exactly recovered. Our main result derives the precise information-theoretic threshold for exact community recovery using any constant number of correlated graphs, answering a question of Gaudio, Rácz, and Sridhar (COLT 2022). In particular, for every $K \geq 3$ we uncover and characterize a region of the parameter space where exact community recovery is possible using $K$ correlated graphs, even though (1) this is information-theoretically impossible using any $K-1$ of them and (2) none of the latent matchings can be exactly recovered."
Poster,Harnessing small projectors and multiple views for efficient vision pretraining,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94719,"Arna Ghosh, Kumar Krishna Agrawal, Shagun Sodhani, Adam Oberman, Blake Richards","Recent progress in self-supervised (SSL) visual representation learning has led to the development of several different proposed frameworks that rely on augmentations of images but use different loss functions. However, there are few theoretically grounded principles to guide practice, so practical implementation of each SSL framework requires several heuristics to achieve competitive performance.In this work, we build on recent analytical results to design practical recommendations for competitive and efficient SSL that are grounded in theory. Specifically, recent theory tells us that existing SSL frameworks are actually minimizing the same idealized loss, which is to learn features that best match the data similarity kernel defined by the augmentations used.We show how this idealized loss can be reformulated to a functionally equivalent loss that is more efficient to compute.We study the implicit bias of using gradient descent to minimize our reformulated loss function, and find that using a stronger orthogonalization constraint with a reduced projector dimensionality should yield good representations.Furthermore, the theory tells us that approximating the reformulated loss should be improved by increasing the number of augmentations, and as such using multiple augmentations should lead to improved convergence.We empirically verify our findings on CIFAR, STL and Imagenet datasets, wherein we demonstrate an improved linear readout performance when training a ResNet-backbone using our theoretically grounded recommendations.  Remarkably, we also demonstrate that by leveraging these insights, we can reduce the pretraining dataset size by up to 2$\times$ while maintaining downstream accuracy simply by using more data augmentations. Taken together, our work provides theoretically grounded recommendations that can be used to improve SSL convergence and efficiency."
