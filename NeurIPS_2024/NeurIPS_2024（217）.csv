Poster,Language Models as Hierarchy Encoders,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95913,"Yuan He, Moy Yuan, Jiaoyan Chen, Ian Horrocks","Interpreting hierarchical structures latent in language is a key limitation of current language models (LMs). While previous research has implicitly leveraged these hierarchies to enhance LMs, approaches for their explicit encoding are yet to be explored. To address this, we introduce a novel approach to re-train transformer encoder-based LMs as Hierarchy Transformer encoders (HiTs), harnessing the expansive nature of hyperbolic space. Our method situates the output embedding space of pre-trained LMs within a Poincaré ball with a curvature that adapts to the embedding dimension, followed by re-training on hyperbolic clustering and centripetal losses. These losses are designed to effectively cluster related entities (input as texts) and organise them hierarchically. We evaluate HiTs against pre-trained LMs, standard fine-tuned LMs, and several hyperbolic embedding baselines, focusing on their capabilities in simulating transitive inference, predicting subsumptions, and transferring knowledge across hierarchies. The results demonstrate that HiTs consistently outperform all baselines in these tasks, underscoring the effectiveness and transferability of our re-trained hierarchy encoders."
Poster,Language Models as Zero-shot Lossless Gradient Compressors: Towards General Neural Parameter Prior Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96482,"Hui-Po Wang, Mario Fritz","Despite the widespread use of statistical prior models in various fields, such models for neural network gradients have long been overlooked. The inherent challenge stems from their high-dimensional structures and complex interdependencies, which complicate effective modeling. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to act as gradient priors in a zero-shot setting. We examine the property by considering lossless gradient compression -- a critical application in distributed learning -- that depends heavily on precise probability modeling. To achieve this, we introduce LM-GC, a novel method that integrates LLMs with arithmetic coding. Our technique converts plain gradients into text-like formats, enhancing token efficiency by up to 38 times compared to their plain representations. We ensure that this data conversion maintains a close alignment with the structure of plain gradients and the symbols commonly recognized by LLMs. Our experiments indicate that LM-GC surpasses existing state-of-the-art lossless compression methods, improving compression rates by 10% up to 17.2% across various datasets and architectures. Additionally, our approach shows promising compatibility with lossy compression techniques such as quantization and sparsification. These findings highlight the significant potential of LLMs as a model for effectively handling gradients. Code is available at https://github.com/hui-po-wang/LM-GC."
Poster,Language Without Borders: A Dataset and Benchmark for Code-Switching Lip Reading,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97448,"Xueyi Zhang, Xueyi Zhang, Mingrui Lao, Peng Zhao, Jun Tang, Yanming Guo, Siqi Cai, Xianghu Yue, Haizhou Li","Lip reading aims at transforming the videos of continuous lip movement into textual contents, and has achieved significant progress over the past decade. It serves as a critical yet practical assistance for speech-impaired individuals, with more practicability than speech recognition in noisy environments. With the increasing interpersonal communications in social media owing to globalization, the existing monolingual datasets for lip reading may not be sufficient to meet the exponential proliferation of bilingual and even multilingual users. However, to our best knowledge, research on code-switching is only explored in speech recognition, while the attempts in lip reading are seriously neglected. To bridge this gap, we have collected a bilingual code-switching lip reading benchmark composed of Chinese and English, dubbed CSLR. As the pioneering work, we recruited 62 speakers with proficient foundations in bothspoken Chinese and English to express sentences containing both involved languages. Through rigorous criteria in data selection, CSLR benchmark has accumulated 85,560 video samples with a resolution of 1080x1920, totaling over 71.3 hours of high-quality code-switching lip movement data. To systematically evaluate the technical challenges in CSLR, we implement commonly-used lip reading backbones, as well as competitive solutions in code-switching speech for benchmark testing. Experiments show CSLR to be a challenging and under-explored lip reading task. We hope our proposed benchmark will extend the applicability of code-switching lip reading, and further contribute to the communities of cross-lingual communication and collaboration. Our dataset and benchmark are accessible at https://github.com/cslr-lipreading/CSLR."
Poster,Large Language Models as Urban Residents: An LLM Agent Framework for Personal Mobility Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96855,"WANG JIAWEI, Renhe Jiang, Chuang Yang, Zengqing Wu, makoto onizuka, Ryosuke Shibasaki, Noboru Koshizuka, Chuan Xiao","This paper introduces a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated into an agent framework for flexible and effective personal mobility generation. LLMs overcome the limitations of previous models by effectively processing semantic data and offering versatility in modeling various tasks. Our approach addresses three research questions: aligning LLMs with real-world urban mobility data, developing reliable activity generation strategies, and exploring LLM applications in urban mobility. The key technical contribution is a novel LLM agent framework that accounts for individual activity patterns and motivations, including a self-consistency approach to align LLMs with real-world activity data and a retrieval-augmented strategy for interpretable activity generation. We evaluate our LLM agent framework and compare it with state-of-the-art personal mobility generation approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and its potential applications in urban mobility. Overall, this study marks the pioneering work of designing an LLM agent framework for activity generation based on real-world human activity data, offering a promising tool for urban mobility analysis."
Poster,Large Language Models' Expert-level Global History Knowledge Benchmark (HiST-LLM),https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97439,"Jakob Hauser, Dániel Kondor, Jenny Reddish, Majid Benam, Enrico Cioni, Federica Villa, James Bennett, Daniel Hoyer, Pieter Francois, Peter Turchin, R. Maria del Rio-Chanona","Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to transform humanities and social science research, yet their history knowledge and comprehension at a graduate level remains untested. Benchmarking LLMs in history is particularly challenging, given that human knowledge of history is inherently unbalanced, with more information available on Western history and recent periods. We introduce the History Seshat Test for LLMs (HiST-LLM), based on a subset of the Seshat Global History Databank, which provides a structured representation of human historical knowledge, containing 36,000 data points across 600 historical societies and over 2,700 scholarly references. This dataset covers every major world region from the Neolithic period to the Industrial Revolution and includes information reviewed and assembled by history experts and graduate research assistants. Using this dataset, we benchmark a total of seven models from the Gemini, OpenAI, and Llama families. We find that, in a four-choice format, LLMs have a balanced accuracy ranging from 33.6% (Llama-3.1-8B) to 46% (GPT-4-Turbo), outperforming random guessing (25%) but falling short of expert comprehension. LLMs perform better on earlier historical periods. Regionally, performance is more even but still better for the Americas and lowest in Oceania and Sub-Saharan Africa for the more advanced models. Our benchmark shows that while LLMs possess some expert-level historical knowledge, there is considerable room for improvement."
Poster,Large Language Models-guided Dynamic Adaptation for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96116,"Jiapu Wang, Sun Kai, LINHAO LUO, Wei Wei, Yongli Hu, Alan Wee-Chung Liew, Shirui Pan, Baocai Yin","Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) is the process of utilizing temporal information to capture complex relations within a Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) to infer new knowledge. Conventional methods in TKGR typically depend on deep learning algorithms or temporal logical rules. However, deep learning-based TKGRs often lack interpretability, whereas rule-based TKGRs struggle to effectively learn temporal rules that capture temporal patterns. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated extensive knowledge and remarkable proficiency in temporal reasoning. Consequently, the employment of LLMs for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) has sparked increasing interest among researchers. Nonetheless, LLMs are known to function as black boxes, making it challenging to comprehend their reasoning process. Additionally, due to the resource-intensive nature of fine-tuning, promptly updating LLMs to integrate evolving knowledge within TKGs for reasoning is impractical. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Large Language Models-guided Dynamic Adaptation (LLM-DA) method for reasoning on TKGs. Specifically, LLM-DA harnesses the capabilities of LLMs to analyze historical data and extract temporal logical rules. These rules unveil temporal patterns and facilitate interpretable reasoning. To account for the evolving nature of TKGs, a dynamic adaptation strategy is proposed to update the LLM-generated rules with the latest events. This ensures that the extracted rules always incorporate the most recent knowledge and better generalize to the predictions on future events. Experimental results show that without the need of fine-tuning, LLM-DA significantly improves the accuracy of reasoning over several common datasets, providing a robust framework for TKGR tasks."
Poster,Large Language Models Must Be Taught to Know What They Don’t Know,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95205,"Sanyam Kapoor, Nate Gruver, Manley Roberts, Katie Collins, Arka Pal, Umang Bhatt, Adrian Weller, Samuel Dooley, Micah Goldblum, Andrew Wilson","When using large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes applications, we need to know when we can trust their predictions. Some works argue that prompting high-performance LLMs is sufficient to produce calibrated uncertainties, while others introduce sampling methods that can be prohibitively expensive. In this work, we first argue that prompting on its own is insufficient to achieve good calibration and then show that fine-tuning on a small dataset of correct and incorrect answers can create an uncertainty estimate with good generalization and small computational overhead. We show that a thousand graded examples are sufficient to outperform baseline methods and that training through the features of a model is necessary for good performance and tractable for large open-source models when using LoRA. We also investigate the mechanisms that enable reliable LLM uncertainty estimation, finding that many models can be used as general-purpose uncertainty estimators, applicable not just to their own uncertainties but also the uncertainty of other models. Lastly, we show that uncertainty estimates inform human use of LLMs in human-AI collaborative settings through a user study."
Poster,Large Language Models Play StarCraft II:Benchmarks and A Chain of Summarization Approach,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93911,"Weiyu Ma, Qirui Mi, Yongcheng Zeng, Xue Yan, Runji Lin, Yuqiao Wu, Jun Wang, Haifeng Zhang","With the continued advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) Agents in reasoning, planning, and decision-making, benchmarks have become crucial in evaluating these skills. However, there is a notable gap in benchmarks for real-time strategic decision-making. StarCraft II (SC2), with its complex and dynamic nature, serves as an ideal setting for such evaluations. To this end, we have developed TextStarCraft II, a specialized environment for assessing LLMs in real-time strategic scenarios within SC2. Addressing the limitations of traditional Chain of Thought (CoT) methods, we introduce the Chain of Summarization (CoS) method, enhancing LLMs' capabilities in rapid and effective decision-making. Our key experiments included:1. LLM Evaluation: Tested 10 LLMs in TextStarCraft II, most of them defeating LV5 build-in AI, showcasing effective strategy skills.2. Commercial Model Knowledge: Evaluated four commercial  models on SC2 knowledge; GPT-4 ranked highest by Grandmaster-level experts.3. Human-AI Matches: Experimental results showed that fine-tuned LLMs performed on par with Gold-level players in real-time matches, demonstrating comparable strategic abilities.All code and data from thisstudy have been made pulicly available at https://github.com/histmeisah/Large-Language-Models-play-StarCraftII"
Poster,Large Language Model Unlearning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96383,"Yuanshun Yao, Xiaojun Xu, Yang Liu","We study how to perform unlearning, i.e. forgetting undesirable (mis)behaviors, on large language models (LLMs). We show at least three scenarios of aligning LLMs with human preferences can benefit from unlearning: (1) removing harmful responses, (2) erasing copyright-protected content as requested, and (3) reducing hallucinations. Unlearning, as an alignment technique, has three advantages. (1) It only requires negative (e.g. harmful) examples, which are much easier and cheaper to collect (e.g. via red teaming or user reporting) than positive (e.g. helpful and often human-written) examples required in the standard alignment process. (2) It is computationally efficient. (3) It is especially effective when we know which training samples cause the misbehavior. To the best of our knowledge, our work is among the first to explore LLM unlearning. We are also among the first to formulate the settings, goals, and evaluations in LLM unlearning. Despite only having negative samples, our ablation study shows that unlearning can still achieve better alignment performance than RLHF with just 2% of its computational time."
Poster,Large Language Model Unlearning via Embedding-Corrupted Prompts,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94295,"Chris Liu, Yaxuan Wang, Jeffrey Flanigan, Yang Liu","Large language models (LLMs) have advanced to encompass extensive knowledge across diverse domains. Yet controlling what a large language model should not know is important for ensuring alignment and thus safe use. However, accurately and efficiently unlearning knowledge from an LLM remains challenging due to the potential collateral damage caused by the fuzzy boundary between retention and forgetting, and the large computational requirements for optimization across state-of-the-art models with hundreds of billions of parameters. In this work, we present \textbf{Embedding-COrrupted (ECO) Prompts}, a lightweight unlearning framework for large language models to address both the challenges of knowledge entanglement and unlearning efficiency. Instead of relying on the LLM itself to unlearn, we enforce an unlearned state during inference by employing a prompt classifier to identify and safeguard prompts to forget. We learn corruptions added to prompt embeddings via zeroth order optimization toward the unlearning objective offline and corrupt prompts flagged by the classifier during inference. We find that these embedding-corrupted prompts not only lead to desirable outputs that satisfy the unlearning objective but also closely approximate the output from a model that has never been trained on the data intended for forgetting. Through extensive experiments on unlearning, we demonstrate the superiority of our method in achieving promising unlearning at \textit{nearly zero side effects} in general domains and domains closely related to the unlearned ones. Additionally, we highlight the scalability of our method to 100 LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 236B parameters, incurring no additional cost as the number of parameters increases. We have made our code publicly available at \url{https://github.com/chrisliu298/llm-unlearn-eco}."
