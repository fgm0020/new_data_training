Poster,HumanVid: Demystifying Training Data for Camera-controllable Human Image Animation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97601,"Zhenzhi Wang, Yixuan Li, Yanhong Zeng, Youqing Fang, Yuwei Guo, Wenran Liu, Jing Tan, Kai Chen, Tianfan Xue, Bo Dai, Dahua Lin","Human image animation involves generating videos from a character photo, allowing user control and unlocking the potential for video and movie production. While recent approaches yield impressive results using high-quality training data, the inaccessibility of these datasets hampers fair and transparent benchmarking. Moreover, these approaches prioritize 2D human motion and overlook the significance of camera motions in videos, leading to limited control and unstable video generation. To demystify the training data, we present HumanVid, the first large-scale high-quality dataset tailored for human image animation, which combines crafted real-world and synthetic data. For the real-world data, we compile a vast collection of real-world videos from the internet. We developed and applied careful filtering rules to ensure video quality, resulting in a curated collection of 20K high-resolution (1080P) human-centric videos. Human and camera motion annotation is accomplished using a 2D pose estimator and a SLAM-based method. To expand our synthetic dataset, we collected 10K 3D avatar assets and leveraged existing assets of body shapes, skin textures and clothings. Notably, we introduce a rule-based camera trajectory generation method, enabling the synthetic pipeline to incorporate diverse and precise camera motion annotation, which can rarely be found in real-world data. To verify the effectiveness of HumanVid, we establish a baseline model named **CamAnimate**, short for Camera-controllable Human Animation, that considers both human and camera motions as conditions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that such simple baseline training on our HumanVid achieves state-of-the-art performance in controlling both human pose and camera motions, setting a new benchmark. Demo, data and code could be found in the project website: https://humanvid.github.io/."
Poster,HumanVLA: Towards Vision-Language Directed Object Rearrangement by Physical Humanoid,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93535,"Xinyu Xu, Yizheng Zhang, Yong-Lu Li, Lei Han, Cewu Lu","Physical Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) plays a crucial role in numerous applications.     However, existing HSI techniques are limited to specific object dynamics and privileged information, which prevents the development of more comprehensive applications.    To address this limitation, we introduce HumanVLA for general object rearrangement directed by practical vision and language.     A teacher-student framework is utilized to develop HumanVLA.    A state-based teacher policy is trained first using goal-conditioned reinforcement learning and adversarial motion prior.    Then, it is distilled into a vision-language-action model via behavior cloning.    We propose several key insights to facilitate the large-scale learning process.    To support general object rearrangement by physical humanoid, we introduce a novel Human-in-the-Room dataset encompassing various rearrangement tasks.    Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
Poster,Humor in AI: Massive Scale Crowd-Sourced Preferences and Benchmarks for Cartoon Captioning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97450,"Jifan Zhang, Lalit Jain, Yang Guo, Jiayi Chen, Kuan Zhou, Siddharth Suresh, Andrew Wagenmaker, Scott Sievert, Timothy T Rogers, Kevin Jamieson, Bob Mankoff, Robert Nowak","We present a novel multimodal preference dataset for creative tasks, consisting of over 250 million human votes on more than 2.2 million captions, collected through crowdsourcing rating data for The New Yorker's weekly cartoon caption contest over the past eight years. This unique dataset supports the development and evaluation of multimodal large language models and preference-based fine-tuning algorithms for humorous caption generation. We propose novel benchmarks for judging the quality of model-generated captions, utilizing both GPT4 and human judgments to establish ranking-based evaluation strategies. Our experimental results highlight the limitations of current fine-tuning methods, such as RLHF and DPO, when applied to creative tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models like GPT4 and Claude currently underperform top human contestants in generating humorous captions. As we conclude this extensive data collection effort, we release the entire preference dataset to the research community, fostering further advancements in AI humor generation and evaluation."
Poster,HuRef: HUman-REadable Fingerprint for Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95154,"Boyi Zeng, Lizheng Wang, Yuncong Hu, Yi Xu, Chenghu Zhou, Xinbing Wang, Yu Yu, Zhouhan Lin","Protecting the copyright of large language models (LLMs) has become crucial due to their resource-intensive training and accompanying carefully designed licenses. However, identifying the original base model of an LLM is challenging due to potential parameter alterations. In thisstudy, we introduce HuRef, a human-readable fingerprint for LLMs that uniquely identifies the base model without interfering with training or exposing model parameters to the public.We first observe that the vector direction of LLM parameters remains stable after the model has converged during pretraining, with negligible perturbations through subsequent training steps, including continued pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and RLHF, which makes it a sufficient conditionto identify the base model.The necessity is validated by continuing to train an LLM with an extra term to drive away the model parameters' direction and the model becomes damaged. However, this direction is vulnerable to simple attacks like dimension permutation or matrix rotation, which significantly change it without affecting performance. To address this, leveraging the Transformer structure, we systematically analyze potential attacks and define three invariant terms that identify an LLM's base model. Due to the potential risk of information leakage, we cannot publish invariant terms directly. Instead, we map them to a Gaussian vector using an encoder, then convert it into a natural image using StyleGAN2, and finally publish the image. In our black-box setting, all fingerprinting steps are internally conducted by the LLMs owners. To ensure the published fingerprints are honestly generated, we introduced Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP).Experimental results across various LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/LUMIA-Group/HuRef."
Poster,HW-GPT-Bench: Hardware-Aware Architecture Benchmark for Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97460,"Rhea Sukthanker, Arber Zela, Benedikt Staffler, Aaron Klein, Lennart Purucker, Jörg Franke, Frank Hutter","The increasing size of language models necessitates a thorough analysis across multiple dimensions to assess trade-offs among crucial hardware metrics such as latency, energy consumption, GPU memory usage, and performance. Identifying optimal model configurations under specific hardware constraints is becoming essential but remains challenging due to the computational load of exhaustive training and evaluation on multiple devices. To address this, we introduce HW-GPT-Bench, a hardware-aware benchmark that utilizes surrogate predictions to approximate various hardware metrics across 13 devices of architectures in the GPT-2 family, with architectures containing up to 1.55B parameters. Our surrogates, via calibrated predictions and reliable uncertainty estimates, faithfully model the heteroscedastic noise inherent in the energy and latency measurements. To estimate perplexity, we employ weight-sharing techniques from Neural Architecture Search (NAS), inheriting pretrained weights from the largest GPT-2 model. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of HW-GPT-Bench by simulating optimization trajectories of various multi-objective optimization algorithms in just a few seconds."
Poster,Hybrid Generative AI for De Novo Design of Co-Crystals with Enhanced Tabletability,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95931,"Nina Gubina, Andrei Dmitrenko, Gleb Solovev, Lyubov Yamshchikova, Oleg Petrov, Ivan Lebedev, Nikita Serov, Grigorii Kirgizov, Nikolay Nikitin, Vladimir Vinogradov","Co-crystallization is an accessible way to control physicochemical characteristics of organic crystals, which finds many biomedical applications. In this work, we present Generative Method for Co-crystal Design (GEMCODE), a novel pipeline for automated co-crystal screening based on the hybridization of deep generative models and evolutionary optimization for broader exploration of the target chemical space. GEMCODE enables fast *de novo* co-crystal design with target tabletability profiles, which is crucial for the development of pharmaceuticals. With a series of experimental studies highlighting validation and discovery cases, we show that GEMCODE is effective even under realistic computational constraints. Furthermore, we explore the potential of language models in generating co-crystals. Finally, we present numerous previously unknown co-crystals predicted by GEMCODE and discuss its potential in accelerating drug development."
Poster,Hybrid Mamba for Few-Shot Segmentation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95222,"Qianxiong Xu, Xuanyi Liu, Lanyun Zhu, Guosheng Lin, Cheng Long, Ziyue Li, Rui Zhao","Many few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods use cross attention to fuse support foreground (FG) into query features, regardless of the quadratic complexity. A recent advance Mamba can also well capture intra-sequence dependencies, yet the complexity is only linear. Hence, we aim to devise a cross (attention-like) Mamba to capture inter-sequence dependencies for FSS. A simple idea is to scan on support features to selectively compress them into the hidden state, which is then used as the initial hidden state to sequentially scan query features. Nevertheless, it suffers from (1) support forgetting issue: query features will also gradually be compressed when scanning on them, so the support features in hidden state keep reducing, and many query pixels cannot fuse sufficient support features; (2) intra-class gap issue: query FG is essentially more similar to itself rather than to support FG, i.e., query may prefer not to fuse support features but their own ones from the hidden state, yet the success of FSS relies on the effective use of support information. To tackle them, we design a hybrid Mamba network (HMNet), including (1) a support recapped Mamba to periodically recap the support features when scanning query, so the hidden state can always contain rich support information; (2) a query intercepted Mamba to forbid the mutual interactions among query pixels, and encourage them to fuse more support features from the hidden state. Consequently, the support information is better utilized, leading to better performance. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two public benchmarks, showing the superiority of HMNet. The code is available at https://github.com/Sam1224/HMNet."
Poster,Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Breaks Sample Size Barriers In Linear MDPs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94483,"Kevin Tan, Wei Fan, Yuting Wei","Hybrid Reinforcement Learning (RL), where an agent learns from both an offline dataset and online explorations in an unknown environment, has garnered significant recent interest. A crucial question posed by Xie et al. (2022) is whether hybrid RL can improve upon the existing lower bounds established in purely offline and purely online RL without relying on the single-policy concentrability assumption. While Li et al. (2023) provided an affirmative answer to this question in the tabular PAC RL case, the question remains unsettled for both the regret-minimizing RL case and the non-tabular case. In this work, building upon recent advancements in offline RL and reward-agnostic exploration, we develop computationally efficient algorithms for both PAC and regret-minimizing RL with linear function approximation, without requiring concentrability on the entire state-action space. We demonstrate that these algorithms achieve sharper error or regret bounds that are no worse than, and can improve on, the optimal sample complexity in offline RL (the first algorithm, for PAC RL) and online RL (the second algorithm, for regret-minimizing RL) in linear Markov decision processes (MDPs), regardless of the quality of the behavior policy. To our knowledge, this work establishes the tightest theoretical guarantees currently available for hybrid RL in linear MDPs."
Poster,Hybrid Top-Down Global Causal Discovery with Local Search for Linear and Nonlinear Additive Noise Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93064,"Sujai Hiremath, Jacqueline Maasch, Mengxiao Gao, Promit Ghosal, Kyra Gan","Learning the unique directed acyclic graph corresponding to an unknown causal model is a challenging task. Methods based on functional causal models can identify a unique graph, but either suffer from the curse of dimensionality or impose strong parametric assumptions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid approach for global causal discovery in observational data that leverages local causal substructures. We first present a topological sorting algorithm that leverages ancestral relationships in linear structural causal models to establish a compact top-down hierarchical ordering, encoding more causal information than linear orderings produced by existing methods. We demonstrate that this approach generalizes to nonlinear settings with arbitrary noise. We then introduce a nonparametric constraint-based algorithm that prunes spurious edges by searching for local conditioning sets, achieving greater accuracy than current methods. We provide theoretical guarantees for correctness and worst-case polynomial time complexities, with empirical validation on synthetic data."
Poster,Hydra: Bidirectional State Space Models Through Generalized Matrix Mixers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93526,"Sukjun Hwang, Aakash Sunil Lahoti, Ratish Puduppully, Tri Dao, Albert Gu","A wide array of sequence models are built on a framework modeled after Transformers, comprising alternating sequence mixer and channel mixer layers.  This paper studies a unifying *matrix mixer* view of sequence mixers that can be conceptualized as a linear map on the input sequence. This framework encompasses a broad range of well-known sequence models, including the self-attention of Transformers as well as recent strong alternatives such as structured state space models (SSMs), and allows understanding downstream characteristics such as efficiency and expressivity through properties of their structured matrix class. We identify a key axis of matrix parameterizations termed *sequence alignment*, which increases the flexibility and performance of matrix mixers, providing insights into the strong performance of Transformers and recent SSMs such as Mamba. Furthermore, the matrix mixer framework offers a systematic approach to developing sequence mixers with desired properties, allowing us to develop several new sub-quadratic sequence models. In particular, we propose a natural bidirectional extension of the Mamba model (**Hydra**), parameterized as a *quasiseparable matrix mixer*, which demonstrates superior performance over other sequence models including Transformers on non-causal tasks. As a drop-in replacement for attention layers, \name outperforms BERT by 0.8 points on the GLUE benchmark and ViT by 2% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet."
