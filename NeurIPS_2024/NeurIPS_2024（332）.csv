Poster,REBEL: Reinforcement Learning via Regressing Relative Rewards,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92983,"Zhaolin Gao, Jonathan Chang, Wenhao Zhan, Owen Oertell, Gokul Swamy, Kianté Brantley, Thorsten Joachims, Drew Bagnell, Jason Lee, Wen Sun","While originally developed for continuous control problems, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) has emerged as the work-horse of a variety of reinforcement learning (RL) applications, including the fine-tuning of generative models. Unfortunately, PPO requires multiple heuristics to enable stable convergence (e.g. value networks, clipping), and is notorious for its sensitivity to the precise implementation of these components. In response, we take a step back and ask what a *minimalist* RL algorithm for the era of generative models would look like. We propose REBEL, an algorithm that cleanly reduces the problem of policy optimization to regressing the *relative reward* between two completions to a prompt in terms of the policy, enabling strikingly lightweight implementation. In theory, we prove that fundamental RL algorithms like Natural Policy Gradient can be seen as variants of REBEL, which allows us to match the strongest known theoretical guarantees in terms of convergence and sample complexity in the RL literature. REBEL can also cleanly incorporate offline data and be extended to handle the intransitive preferences we frequently see in practice. Empirically, we find that REBEL provides a unified approach to language modeling and image generation with stronger or similar performance as PPO and DPO, all while being simpler to implement and more computationally efficient than PPO. When fine-tuning Llama-3-8B-Instruct, REBEL achieves strong performance in AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and Open LLM Leaderboard. Implementation of REBEL can be found at <https://github.com/ZhaolinGao/REBEL>, and models trained by REBEL can be found at <https://huggingface.co/Cornell-AGI>."
Poster,REBORN: Reinforcement-Learned Boundary Segmentation with Iterative Training for Unsupervised ASR,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94927,"Liang-Hsuan Tseng, En-Pei Hu, Cheng-Han Chiang, Yuan Tseng, Hung-yi Lee, Lin-shan Lee, Shao-Hua Sun","Unsupervised automatic speech recognition (ASR) aims to learn the mapping between the speech signal and its corresponding textual transcription without the supervision of paired speech-text data. A word/phoneme in the speech signal is represented by a segment of speech signal with variable length and unknown boundary, and this segmental structure makes learning the mapping between speech and text challenging, especially without paired data. In this paper, we propose REBORN, Reinforcement-Learned Boundary Segmentation with Iterative Training for Unsupervised ASR. REBORN alternates between (1) training a segmentation model that predicts the boundaries of the segmental structures in speech signals and (2) training the phoneme prediction model, whose input is a segmental structure segmented by the segmentation model, to predict a phoneme transcription. Since supervised data for training the segmentation model is not available, we use reinforcement learning to train the segmentation model to favor segmentations that yield phoneme sequence predictions with a lower perplexity. We conduct extensive experiments and find that under the same setting, REBORN outperforms all prior unsupervised ASR models on LibriSpeech, TIMIT, and five non-English languages in Multilingual LibriSpeech. We comprehensively analyze why the boundaries learned by REBORN improve the unsupervised ASR performance."
Poster,Reciprocal Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93740,"Julian Rodemann, Christoph Jansen, Georg Schollmeyer","We demonstrate that numerous machine learning algorithms are specific instances of one single paradigm: reciprocal learning. These instances range from active learning over multi-armed bandits to self-training. We show that all these algorithms not only learn parameters from data but also vice versa: They iteratively alter training data in a way that depends on the current model fit. We introduce reciprocal learning as a generalization of these algorithms using the language of decision theory. This allows us to study under what conditions they converge. The key is to guarantee that reciprocal learning contracts such that the Banach fixed-point theorem applies. In this way, we find that reciprocal learning converges at linear rates to an approximately optimal model under some assumptions on the loss function, if their predictions are probabilistic and the sample adaption is both non-greedy and either randomized or regularized. We interpret these findings and provide corollaries that relate them to active learning, self-training, and bandits."
Poster,Reciprocal Reward Influence Encourages Cooperation From Self-Interested Agents,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94874,"John L Zhou, Weizhe Hong, Jonathan Kao","Cooperation between self-interested individuals is a widespread phenomenon in the natural world, but remains elusive in interactions between artificially intelligent agents. Instead, naïve reinforcement learning algorithms typically converge to Pareto-dominated outcomes in even the simplest of social dilemmas. An emerging literature on opponent shaping has demonstrated the ability to reach prosocial outcomes by influencing the learning of other agents. However, such methods differentiate through the learning step of other agents or optimize for meta-game dynamics, which rely on privileged access to opponents' learning algorithms or exponential sample complexity, respectively. To provide a learning rule-agnostic and sample-efficient alternative, we introduce Reciprocators, reinforcement learning agents which are intrinsically motivated to reciprocate the influence of opponents' actions on their returns. This approach seeks to modify other agents' $Q$-values by increasing their return following beneficial actions (with respect to the Reciprocator) and decreasing it after detrimental actions, guiding them towards mutually beneficial actions without directly differentiating through a model of their policy. We show that Reciprocators can be used to promote cooperation in temporally extended social dilemmas during simultaneous learning. Our code is available at https://github.com/johnlyzhou/reciprocator/."
Poster,Recognize Any Regions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93502,"Haosen Yang, Chuofan Ma, Bin Wen, Yi Jiang, Zehuan Yuan, Xiatian Zhu","Understanding the semantics of individual regions or patches of unconstrained images, such as open-world object detection, remains a critical yet challenging task in computer vision. Building on the success of powerful image-level vision-language (ViL) foundation models like CLIP, recent efforts have sought to harness their capabilities by either training a contrastive model from scratch with an extensive collection of region-label pairs or aligning the outputs of a detection model with image-level representations of region proposals. Despite notable progress, these approaches are plagued by computationally intensive training requirements, susceptibility to data noise, and deficiency in contextual information. To address these limitations, we explore the synergistic potential of off-the-shelf foundation models, leveraging their respective strengths in localization and semantics. We introduce a novel, generic, and efficient architecture, named RegionSpot, designed to integrate position-aware localization knowledge from a localization foundation model (e.g., SAM) with semantic information from a ViL model (e.g., CLIP). To fully exploit pretrained knowledge while minimizing training overhead, we keep both foundation models frozen, focusing optimization efforts solely on a lightweight attention-based knowledge integration module.Extensive experiments in open-world object recognition show that our  RegionSpot achieves significant performance gain over prior alternatives, along with substantial computational savings (e.g., training our model with 3 million data in a single day using 8 V100 GPUs). RegionSpot outperforms GLIP-L by 2.9 in mAP on LVIS val set,  with an even larger margin of 13.1 AP for more challenging and rare categories, and a 2.5 AP increase on ODinW. Furthermore, it exceeds GroundingDINO-L by 11.0 AP for rare categories on the LVIS minival set."
Poster,Reconstruct and Match: Out-of-Distribution Robustness via Topological Homogeneity,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94189,"Chaoqi Chen, Luyao Tang, Hui Huang","Since deep learning models are usually deployed in non-stationary environments, it is imperative to improve their robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. A common approach to mitigate distribution shift is to regularize internal representations or predictors learned from in-distribution (ID) data to be domain invariant. Past studies have primarily learned pairwise invariances, ignoring the intrinsic structure and high-order dependencies of the data. Unlike machines, human recognizes objects by first dividing them into major components and then identifying the topological relation of these components. Motivated by this, we propose Reconstruct and Match (REMA), a general learning framework for object recognition tasks to endow deep models with the capability of capturing the topological homogeneity of objects without human prior knowledge or fine-grained annotations. To identify major components from objects, REMA introduces a selective slot-based reconstruction module to dynamically map dense pixels into a sparse and discrete set of slot vectors in an unsupervised manner. Then, to model high-order dependencies among these components, we propose a hypergraph-based relational reasoning module that models the intricate relations of nodes (slots) with structural constraints. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that REMA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in OOD generalization and test-time adaptation settings."
Poster,Reconstructing the Image Stitching Pipeline: Integrating Fusion and Rectangling into a Unified Inpainting Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94635,"Ziqi Xie, Weidong Zhao, XianhuiLiu, Jian Zhao, Ning Jia","Deep learning-based image stitching pipelines are typically divided into three cascading stages: registration, fusion, and rectangling. Each stage requires its own network training and is tightly coupled to the others, leading to error propagation and posing significant challenges to parameter tuning and system stability. This paper proposes the Simple and Robust Stitcher (SRStitcher), which revolutionizes the image stitching pipeline by simplifying the fusion and rectangling stages into a unified inpainting model, requiring no model training or fine-tuning. We reformulate the problem definitions of the fusion and rectangling stages and demonstrate that they can be effectively integrated into an inpainting task. Furthermore, we design the weighted masks to guide the reverse process in a pre-trained large-scale diffusion model, implementing this integrated inpainting task in a single inference. Through extensive experimentation, we verify the interpretability and generalization capabilities of this unified model, demonstrating that SRStitcher outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both performance and stability."
Poster,Reconstruction Attacks on Machine Unlearning: Simple Models are Vulnerable,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94032,"Martin Bertran, Shuai Tang, Michael Kearns, Jamie Morgenstern, Aaron Roth, Steven Wu","Machine unlearning is motivated by principles of data autonomy. The premise is that a person can request to have their data's influence removed from deployed models, and those models should be updated as if they were retrained without the person's data. We show that these updates expose individuals to high-accuracy reconstruction attacks which allow the attacker to recover their data in its entirety, even when the original models are so simple that privacy risk might not otherwise have been a concern. We show how to mount a near-perfect attack on the deleted data point from linear regression models. We then generalize our attack to other loss functions and architectures,  and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks across a wide range of datasets (capturing both tabular and image data). Our work highlights that privacy risk is significant even for extremely simple model classes when individuals can request deletion of their data from the model."
Poster,Reconstruction of Manipulated Garment with Guided Deformation Prior,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94594,"Ren Li, Corentin Dumery, Zhantao Deng, Pascal Fua","Modeling the shape of garments has received much attention, but most existing approaches assume the garments to be worn by someone, which constrains the range of shapes they can assume. In this work, we address shape recovery when garments are being manipulated instead of worn, which gives rise to an even larger range of possible shapes. To this end, we leverage the implicit sewing patterns (ISP) model for garment modeling and extend it by adding a diffusion-based deformation prior to represent these shapes. To recover 3D garment shapes from incomplete 3D point clouds acquired when the garment is folded, we map the points to UV space, in which our priors are learned, to produce partial UV maps, and then fit the priors to recover complete UV maps and 2D to 3D mappings. Experimental results demonstrate the superior reconstruction accuracy of our method compared to previous ones, especially when dealing with large non-rigid deformations arising from the manipulations."
Poster,Recovering Complete Actions for Cross-dataset Skeleton Action Recognition,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93611,"Hanchao Liu, Yujiang Li, Tai-Jiang Mu, Shi-min Hu","Despite huge progress in skeleton-based action recognition, its generalizability to different domains remains a challenging issue. In this paper, to solve the skeleton action generalization problem, we present a recover-and-resample augmentation framework based on a novel complete action prior. We observe that human daily actions are confronted with temporal mismatch across different datasets, as they are usually partial observations of their complete action sequences. By recovering complete actions and resampling from these full sequences, we can generate strong augmentations for unseen domains. At the same time, we discover the nature of general action completeness within large datasets, indicated by the per-frame diversity over time. This allows us to exploit two assets of transferable knowledge that can be shared across action samples and be helpful for action completion: boundary poses for determining the action start, and linear temporal transforms for capturing global action patterns. Therefore, we formulate the recovering stage as a two-step stochastic action completion with boundary pose-conditioned extrapolation followed by smooth linear transforms. Both the boundary poses and linear transforms can be efficiently learned from the whole dataset via clustering. We validate our approach on a cross-dataset setting with three skeleton action datasets, outperforming other domain generalization approaches by a considerable margin."
