Poster,Proportional Fairness in Non-Centroid Clustering,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96242,"Ioannis Caragiannis, Evi Micha, Nisarg Shah","We revisit the recently developed framework of proportionally fair clustering, where the goal is to provide group fairness guarantees that become stronger for groups of data points that are large and cohesive. Prior work applies this framework to centroid-based clustering, where points are partitioned into clusters, and the cost to each data point is measured by its distance to a centroid assigned to its cluster. However, real-life applications often do not require such centroids. We extend the theory of proportionally fair clustering to non-centroid clustering by considering a variety of cost functions, both metric and non-metric, for a data point to be placed in a cluster with other data points. Our results indicate that Greedy Capture, a clustering algorithm developed for centroid clustering, continues to provide strong proportional fairness guarantees for non-centroid clustering, although the guarantees are significantly different and establishing them requires novel proof ideas. We also design algorithms for auditing proportional fairness of a given clustering solution. We conduct experiments on real data which suggest that traditional clustering algorithms are highly unfair, while our algorithms achieve strong fairness guarantees with a moderate loss in common clustering objectives."
Poster,Prospective Learning: Learning for a Dynamic Future,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94786,"Ashwin De Silva, Rahul Ramesh, Rubing Yang, Siyu Yu, Joshua T Vogelstein, Pratik Chaudhari","In real-world applications, the distribution of the data, and our goals, evolve over time. The prevailing theoretical framework for studying machine learning, namely probably approximately correct (PAC) learning, largely ignores time. As a consequence, existing strategies to address the dynamic nature of data and goals exhibit poor real-world performance. This paper develops a theoretical framework called""Prospective Learning"" that is tailored for situations when the optimal hypothesis changes over time. In PAC learning, empirical risk minimization (ERM) is known to be consistent. We develop a learner called Prospective ERM, which returns a sequence of predictors that  make predictions on future data.  We prove that the risk of prospective ERM converges to the Bayes risk under certain assumptions on the stochastic process  generating the data. Prospective ERM, roughly speaking, incorporates time as an input in addition to the data. We show that standard ERM as done in PAC learning, without incorporating time, can result in failure to learn when distributions are dynamic. Numerical experiments illustrate that prospective ERM can learn synthetic and visual recognition problems constructed from MNIST and CIFAR-10. Code at https://github.com/neurodata/prolearn."
Poster,Prospective Representation Learning for Non-Exemplar Class-Incremental Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94608,"Wuxuan Shi, Mang Ye","Non-exemplar class-incremental learning (NECIL) is a challenging task that requires recognizing both old and new classes without retaining any old class samples. Current works mainly deal with the conflicts between old and new classes retrospectively as a new task comes in. However, the lack of old task data makes balancing old and new classes difficult. Instead, we propose a Prospective Representation Learning (PRL) approach to prepare the model for handling conflicts in advance. In the base phase, we squeeze the embedding distribution of the current classes to reserve space for forward compatibility with future classes. In the incremental phase, we make the new class features away from the saved prototypes of old classes in a latent space while aligning the current embedding space with the latent space when updating the model. Thereby, the new class features are clustered in the reserved space to minimize the shock of the new classes on the former classes. Our approach can help existing NECIL baselines to balance old and new classes in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."
Poster,PROSPECT PTMs: Rich Labeled Tandem Mass Spectrometry Dataset of Modified Peptides for Machine Learning in Proteomics,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97558,"Wassim Gabriel, Omar Shouman, Eva Ayla Schröder, Florian Bößl, Mathias Wilhelm","Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) are changes that occur in proteins after synthesis, influencing their structure, function, and cellular behavior. PTMs are essential in cell biology; they regulate protein function and stability, are involved in various cellular processes, and are linked to numerous diseases. A particularly interesting class of PTMs are chemical modifications such as phosphorylation introduced on amino acid side chains because they can drastically alter the physicochemical properties of the peptides once they are present. One or more PTMs can be attached to each amino acid of the peptide sequence. The most commonly applied technique to detect PTMs on proteins is bottom-up Mass Spectrometry-based proteomics (MS), where proteins are digested into peptides and subsequently analyzed using Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS). While an increasing number of machine learning models are published focusing on MS/MS-related property prediction of unmodified peptides, high-quality reference data for modified peptides is missing, impeding model development for this important class of peptides. To enable researchers to train machine learning models that can accurately predict the properties of modified peptides, we introduce four high-quality labeled datasets for applying machine and deep learning to tasks in MS-based proteomics. The four datasets comprise several subgroups of peptides with 1.2 million unique modified peptide sequences and 30 unique pairs of (amino-acid, PTM), covering both experimentally introduced and naturally occurring modifications on various amino acids. We evaluate the utility and importance of the dataset by providing benchmarking results on models trained with and without modifications and highlighting the impact of including modified sequences on downstream tasks. We demonstrate that predicting the properties of modified peptides is more challenging but has a broad impact since they are often the core of protein functionality and its regulation, and they have a potential role as biomarkers in clinical applications. Our datasets contribute to applied machine learning in proteomics by enabling the research community to experiment with methods to encode PTMs as model inputs and to benchmark against reference data for model comparison. With a proper data split for three common tasks in proteomics, we provide a robust way to evaluate model performance and assess generalization on unseen modified sequences."
Poster,ProSST: Protein Language Modeling with Quantized Structure and Disentangled Attention,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96656,"Mingchen Li, Yang Tan, Xinzhu Ma, Bozitao Zhong, Huiqun Yu, Ziyi Zhou, Wanli Ouyang, Bingxin Zhou, Pan Tan, Liang Hong","Protein language models (PLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various protein function prediction tasks. However, while protein function is intricately tied to structure, most existing PLMs do not incorporate protein structure information. To address this issue, we introduce ProSST, a Transformer-based protein language model that seamlessly integrates both protein sequences and structures. ProSST incorporates a structure quantization module and a Transformer architecture with disentangled attention. The structure quantization module translates a 3D protein structure into a sequence of discrete tokens by first serializing the protein structure into residue-level local structures and then embeds them into dense vector space. These vectors are then quantized into discrete structure tokens by a pre-trained clustering model. These tokens serve as an effective protein structure representation. Furthermore, ProSST explicitly learns the relationship between protein residue token sequences and structure token sequences through the sequence-structure disentangled attention. We pre-train ProSST on millions of protein structures using a masked language model objective, enabling it to learn comprehensive contextual representations of proteins. To evaluate the proposed ProSST, we conduct extensive experiments on the zero-shot mutation effect prediction and several supervised downstream tasks, where ProSST achieves the state-of-the-art performance among all baselines. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available."
Poster,Protected Test-Time Adaptation via Online Entropy Matching: A Betting Approach,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93486,"Yarin Bar, Shalev Shaer, Yaniv Romano","We present a novel approach for test-time adaptation via online self-training, consisting of two components. First, we introduce a statistical framework that detects distribution shifts in the classifier's entropy values obtained on a stream of unlabeled samples. Second, we devise an online adaptation mechanism that utilizes the evidence of distribution shifts captured by the detection tool to dynamically update the classifier's parameters. The resulting adaptation process drives the distribution of test entropy values obtained from the self-trained classifier to match those of the source domain, building invariance to distribution shifts. This approach departs from the conventional self-training method, which focuses on minimizing the classifier's entropy. Our approach combines concepts in betting martingales and online learning to form a detection tool capable of quickly reacting to distribution shifts. We then reveal a tight relation between our adaptation scheme and optimal transport, which forms the basis of our novel self-supervised loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves test-time accuracy under distribution shifts while maintaining accuracy and calibration in their absence, outperforming leading entropy minimization methods across various scenarios."
Poster,Protecting Your LLMs with Information Bottleneck,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93290,"Zichuan Liu, Zefan Wang, Linjie Xu, Jinyu Wang, Lei Song, Tianchun Wang, Chunlin Chen, Wei Cheng, Jiang Bian","The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of natural language processing, yet they might be attacked to produce harmful content.Despite efforts to ethically align LLMs, these are often fragile and can be circumvented by jailbreaking attacks through optimized or manual adversarial prompts.To address this, we introduce the Information Bottleneck Protector (IBProtector), a defense mechanism grounded in the information bottleneck principle, and we modify the objective to avoid trivial solutions.The IBProtector selectively compresses and perturbs prompts, facilitated by a lightweight and trainable extractor, preserving only essential information for the target LLMs to respond with the expected answer.Moreover, we further consider a situation where the gradient is not visible to be compatible with any LLM.Our empirical evaluations show that IBProtector outperforms current defense methods in mitigating jailbreak attempts, without overly affecting response quality or inference speed. Its effectiveness and adaptability across various attack methods and target LLMs underscore the potential of IBProtector as a novel, transferable defense that bolsters the security of LLMs without requiring modifications to the underlying models."
Poster,Protein-Nucleic Acid Complex Modeling with Frame Averaging Transformer,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94745,"Tinglin Huang, Zhenqiao Song, Rex Ying, Wengong Jin","Nucleic acid-based drugs like aptamers have recently demonstrated great therapeutic potential. However, experimental platforms for aptamer screening are costly, and the scarcity of labeled data presents a challenge for supervised methods to learn protein-aptamer binding. To this end, we develop an unsupervised learning approach based on the predicted pairwise contact map between a protein and a nucleic acid and demonstrate its effectiveness in protein-aptamer binding prediction. Our model is based on FAFormer, a novel equivariant transformer architecture that seamlessly integrates frame averaging (FA) within each transformer block. This integration allows our model to infuse geometric information into node features while preserving the spatial semantics of coordinates, leading to greater expressive power than standard FA models. Our results show that FAFormer outperforms existing equivariant models in contact map prediction across three protein complex datasets, with over 10% relative improvement. Moreover, we curate five real-world protein-aptamer interaction datasets and show that the contact map predicted by FAFormer serves as a strong binding indicator for aptamer screening."
Poster,ProtGO: Function-Guided Protein Modeling for Unified Representation Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96904,"Bozhen Hu, Cheng Tan, Yongjie Xu, Zhangyang Gao, Jun Xia, Lirong Wu, Stan Z. Li","Protein representation learning is indispensable for various downstream applications of artificial intelligence for bio-medicine research, such as drug design and function prediction. However, achieving effective representation learning for proteins poses challenges due to the diversity of data modalities involved, including sequence, structure, and function annotations. Despite the impressive capabilities of large language models in biomedical text modelling, there remains a pressing need for a framework that seamlessly integrates these diverse modalities, particularly focusing on the three critical aspects of protein information: sequence, structure, and function. Moreover, addressing the inherent data scale differences among these modalities is essential. To tackle these challenges, we introduce ProtGO, a unified model that harnesses a teacher network equipped with a customized graph neural network (GNN) and a Gene Ontology (GO) encoder to learn hybrid embeddings. Notably, our approach eliminates the need for additional functions as input for the student network, which shares the same GNN module. Importantly, we utilize a domain adaptation method to facilitate distribution approximation for guiding the training of the teacher-student framework. This approach leverages distributions learned from latent representations to avoid the alignment of individual samples. Benchmark experiments highlight that ProtGO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, clearly demonstrating the advantages of the proposed unified framework."
Poster,Prototypical Hash Encoding for On-the-Fly Fine-Grained Category Discovery,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93382,"Haiyang Zheng, Nan Pu, Wenjing Li, Nicu Sebe, Zhun Zhong","In this paper, we study a practical yet challenging task, On-the-fly Category Discovery (OCD), aiming to online discover the newly-coming stream data that belong to both known and unknown classes, by leveraging only known category knowledge contained in labeled data. Previous OCD methods employ the hash-based technique to represent old/new categories by hash codes for instance-wise inference. However, directly mapping features into low-dimensional hash space not only inevitably damages the ability to distinguish classes and but also causes ``high sensitivity'' issue, especially for fine-grained classes, leading to inferior performance. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel Prototypical Hash Encoding (PHE) framework consisting of Category-aware Prototype Generation (CPG) and Discriminative Category Encoding (DCE) to mitigate the sensitivity of hash code while preserving rich discriminative information contained in high-dimension feature space, in a two-stage projection fashion. CPG enables the model to fully capture the intra-category diversity by representing each category with multiple prototypes. DCE boosts the discrimination ability of hash code with the guidance of the generated category prototypes and the constraint of minimum separation distance. By jointly optimizing CPG and DCE, we demonstrate that these two components are mutually beneficial towards an effective OCD. Extensive experiments show the significant superiority of our PHE over previous methods, e.g. obtaining an improvement of +5.3% in ALL ACC averaged on all datasets. Moreover, due to the nature of the interpretable prototypes, we visually analyze the underlying mechanism of how PHE helps group certain samples into either known or unknown categories. Code is available at https://github.com/HaiyangZheng/PHE."
