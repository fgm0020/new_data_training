Poster,Exploring Molecular Pretraining Model at Scale,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96550,"xiaohong ji, Zhen Wang, Zhifeng Gao, Hang Zheng, Linfeng Zhang, Guolin Ke, Weinan E","In recent years, pretraining models have made significant advancements in the fields of natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and life sciences. The significant advancements in NLP and CV are predominantly driven by the expansion of model parameters and data size, a phenomenon now recognized as the scaling laws. However, research exploring scaling law in molecular pretraining model remains unexplored. In this work, we present an innovative molecular pretraining model that leverages a two-track transformer to effectively integrate features at the atomic level, graph level, and geometry structure level. Along with this, we systematically investigate the scaling law within molecular pretraining models, examining the power-law correlations between validation loss and model size, dataset size, and computational resources. Consequently, we successfully scale the model to 1.1 billion parameters through pretraining on 800 million conformations, making it the largest molecular pretraining model to date. Extensive experiments show the consistent improvement on the downstream tasks as the model size grows up. The model with 1.1 billion parameters also outperform over existing methods, achieving an average 27\% improvement on the QM9 and 14\% on COMPAS-1D dataset."
Poster,Exploring Structured Semantic Priors Underlying Diffusion Score for Test-time Adaptation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94444,"Mingjia Li, Shuang Li, Tongrui Su, Longhui Yuan, Jian Liang, Wei Li","Capitalizing on the complementary advantages of generative and discriminative models has always been a compelling vision in machine learning, backed by a growing body of research. This work discloses the hidden semantic structure within score-based generative models, unveiling their potential as effective discriminative priors. Inspired by our theoretical findings, we propose DUSA to exploit the structured semantic priors underlying diffusion score to facilitate the test-time adaptation of image classifiers or dense predictors. Notably, DUSA extracts knowledge from a single timestep of denoising diffusion, lifting the curse of Monte Carlo-based likelihood estimation over timesteps. We demonstrate the efficacy of our DUSA in adapting a wide variety of competitive pre-trained discriminative models on diverse test-time scenarios. Additionally, a thorough ablation study is conducted to dissect the pivotal elements in DUSA. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/BIT-DA/DUSA."
Poster,Exploring the Edges of Latent State Clusters for Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96298,"Yuanlin Duan, Guofeng Cui, He Zhu","Exploring unknown environments efficiently is a fundamental challenge in unsupervised goal-conditioned reinforcement learning. While selecting exploratory goals at the frontier of previously explored states is an effective strategy, the policy during training may still have limited capability of reaching rare goals on the frontier, resulting in reduced exploratory behavior. We propose ""Cluster Edge Exploration"" (CE$^2$), a new goal-directed exploration algorithm that when choosing goals in sparsely explored areas of the state space gives priority to goal states that remain accessible to the agent. The key idea is clustering to group states that are easily reachable from one another by the current policy under training in a latent space, and traversing to states holding significant exploration potential on the boundary of these clusters before doing exploratory behavior. In challenging robotics environments including navigating a maze with a multi-legged ant robot, manipulating objects with a robot arm on a cluttered tabletop, and rotating objects in the palm of an anthropomorphic robotic hand, CE$^2$ demonstrates superior efficiency in exploration compared to baseline methods and ablations."
Poster,Exploring the Precise Dynamics of Single-Layer GAN Models: Leveraging Multi-Feature Discriminators for High-Dimensional Subspace Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93392,"Andrew Bond, Zafer Dogan","Subspace learning is a critical endeavor in contemporary machine learning, particularly given the vast dimensions of modern datasets. In this study, we delve into the training dynamics of a single-layer GAN model from the perspective of subspace learning, framing these GANs as a novel approach to this fundamental task. Through a rigorous scaling limit analysis, we offer insights into the behavior of this model. Extending beyond prior research that primarily focused on sequential feature learning, we investigate the non-sequential scenario, emphasizing the pivotal role of inter-feature interactions in expediting training and enhancing performance, particularly with an uninformed initialization strategy. Our investigation encompasses both synthetic and real-world datasets, such as MNIST and Olivetti Faces, demonstrating the robustness and applicability of our findings to practical scenarios. By bridging our analysis to the realm of subspace learning, we systematically compare the efficacy of GAN-based methods against conventional approaches, both theoretically and empirically. Notably, our results unveil that while all methodologies successfully capture the underlying subspace, GANs exhibit a remarkable capability to acquire a more informative basis, owing to their intrinsic ability to generate new data samples. This elucidates the unique advantage of GAN-based approaches in subspace learning tasks."
Poster,Exploring the Role of Large Language Models in Prompt Encoding for Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96434,"Bingqi Ma, ZHUOFAN ZONG, Guanglu Song, Hongsheng Li, Yu Liu","Large language models based on decoder-only transformers have demonstrated superior text understanding capabilities compared to CLIP and T5-series models.However, the paradigm for utilizing current advanced LLMs in text-to-image diffusion models remains to be explored.We observed an unusual phenomenon: directly using a large language model as the prompt encoder significantly degrades the prompt-following ability in image generation.We identified two main obstacles behind this issue.One is the misalignment between the next token prediction training in LLM and the requirement for discriminative prompt features in diffusion models.The other is the intrinsic positional bias introduced by the decoder-only architecture.To deal with this issue, we propose a novel framework to fully harness the capabilities of LLMs.Through the carefully designed usage guidance, we effectively enhance the text representation capability of the LLM for prompt encoding and eliminate its inherent positional bias.This allows us to flexibly integrate state-of-the-art LLMs into the text-to-image generation model.Furthermore, we also provide an effective manner to fuse multiple LLMs into our framework.Considering the excellent performance and scaling capabilities demonstrated by the transformer architecture, we further design an LLM-Infused Diffusion Transformer (LI-DIT)based on the framework.We conduct extensive experiments to validate LI-DIT across model size and data size.Benefiting from the inherent ability of the LLMs and our innovative designs, the prompt understanding performance of  LI-DIT easily surpasses state-of-the-art open-source models as well as mainstream closed-source commercial models including Stable Diffusion 3, DALL-E 3, and Midjourney V6."
Poster,Exploring the trade-off between deep-learning and explainable models for brain-machine interfaces,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94983,"Luis Cubillos, Guy Revach, Matthew Mender, Joseph Costello, Hisham Temmar, Aren Hite, Diksha Anoop Kumar Zutshi, Dylan Wallace, Xiaoyong Ni, Madison Kelberman, Matt Willsey, Ruud Van Sloun, Nir Shlezinger, Parag Patil, Anne Draelos, Cynthia Chestek","People with brain or spinal cord-related paralysis often need to rely on others for basic tasks, limiting their independence. A potential solution is brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), which could allow them to voluntarily control external devices (e.g., robotic arm) by decoding brain activity to movement commands. In the past decade, deep-learning decoders have achieved state-of-the-art results in most BMI applications, ranging from speech production to finger control. However, the 'black-box' nature of deep-learning decoders could lead to unexpected behaviors, resulting in major safety concerns in real-world physical control scenarios. In these applications, explainable but lower-performing decoders, such as the Kalman filter (KF), remain the norm. In this study, we designed a BMI decoder based on KalmanNet, an extension of the KF that augments its operation with recurrent neural networks to compute the Kalman gain. This results in a varying “trust” that shifts between inputs and dynamics. We used this algorithm to predict finger movements from the brain activity of two monkeys. We compared KalmanNet results offline (pre-recorded data, $n=13$ days) and online (real-time predictions, $n=5$ days) with a simple KF and two recent deep-learning algorithms: tcFNN (non-ReFIT version) and LSTM. KalmanNet achieved comparable or better results than other deep learning models in offline and online modes, relying on the dynamical model for stopping while depending more on neural inputs for initiating movements. We further validated this mechanism by implementing a heteroscedastic KF that used the same strategy, and it also approached state-of-the-art performance while remaining in the explainable domain of standard KFs. However, we also see two downsides to KalmanNet. KalmanNet shares the limited generalization ability of existing deep-learning decoders, and its usage of the KF as an inductive bias limits its performance in the presence of unseen noise distributions. Despite this trade-off, our analysis successfully integrates traditional controls and modern deep-learning approaches to motivate high-performing yet still explainable BMI designs."
Poster,Exploring Token Pruning in Vision State Space Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94262,"Zheng Zhan, Zhenglun Kong, Yifan Gong, Yushu Wu, Zichong Meng, Hangyu Zheng, Xuan Shen, Stratis Ioannidis, Wei Niu, Pu Zhao, Yanzhi Wang","State Space Models (SSMs) have the advantage of keeping linear computational complexity compared to attention modules in transformers, and have been applied to vision tasks as a new type of powerful vision foundation model. Inspired by the observations that the final prediction in vision transformers (ViTs) is only based on a subset of most informative tokens, we take the novel step of enhancing the efficiency of SSM-based vision models through token-based pruning. However, direct applications of existing token pruning techniques designed for ViTs fail to deliver good performance, even with extensive fine-tuning. To address this issue, we revisit the unique computational characteristics of SSMs and discover that naive application disrupts the sequential token positions. This insight motivates us to design a novel and general token pruning method specifically for SSM-based vision models. We first introduce a pruning-aware hidden state alignment method to stabilize the neighborhood of remaining tokens for performance enhancement. Besides, based on our detailed analysis, we propose a token importance evaluation method adapted for SSM models, to guide the token pruning. With efficient implementation and practical acceleration methods, our method brings actual speedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve significant computation reduction with minimal impact on performance across different tasks. Notably, we achieve 81.7\% accuracy on ImageNet with a 41.6\% reduction in the FLOPs for pruned PlainMamba-L3. Furthermore, our work provides deeper insights into understanding the behavior of SSM-based vision models for future research."
Poster,eXponential FAmily Dynamical Systems (XFADS): Large-scale nonlinear Gaussian state-space modeling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95571,"Matthew Dowling, Yuan Zhao, Memming Park","State-space graphical models and the variational autoencoder framework provide a principled apparatus for learning dynamical systems from data.  State-of-the-art probabilistic approaches are often able to scale to large problems at the cost of flexibility of the variational posterior or expressivity of the dynamics model.  However, those consolidations can be detrimental if the ultimate goal is to learn a generative model capable of explaining the spatiotemporal structure of the data and making accurate forecasts.  We introduce a low-rank structured variational autoencoding framework for nonlinear Gaussian state-space graphical models capable of capturing dense covariance structures that are important for learning dynamical systems with predictive capabilities.  Our inference algorithm exploits the covariance structures that arise naturally from sample based approximate Gaussian message passing and low-rank amortized posterior updates -- effectively performing approximate variational smoothing with time complexity scaling linearly in the state dimensionality.  In comparisons with other deep state-space model architectures our approach consistently demonstrates the ability to learn a more predictive generative model.  Furthermore, when applied to neural physiological recordings, our approach is able to learn a dynamical system capable of forecasting population spiking and behavioral correlates from a small portion of single trials."
Poster,Exponential Quantum Communication Advantage in Distributed Inference and Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94157,"Dar Gilboa, Hagay Michaeli, Daniel Soudry, Jarrod McClean","Training and inference with large machine learning models that far exceed the memory capacity of individual devices necessitates the design of distributed architectures, forcing one to contend with communication constraints.  We present a framework for distributed computation over a quantum network in which data is encoded into specialized quantum states. We prove that for models within this framework, inference and training using gradient descent can be performed with exponentially less communication compared to their classical analogs, and with relatively modest overhead relative to standard gradient-based methods. We show that certain graph neural networks are particularly amenable to implementation within this framework, and moreover present empirical evidence that they perform well on standard benchmarks.To our knowledge, this is the first example of exponential quantum advantage for a generic class of machine learning problems that hold regardless of the data encoding cost. Moreover, we show that models in this class can encode highly nonlinear features of their inputs, and their expressivity increases exponentially with model depth.We also delineate the space of models for which exponential communication advantages hold by showing that they cannot hold for linear classification. Communication of quantum states that potentially limit the amount of information that can be extracted from them about the data and model parameters may also lead to improved privacy guarantees for distributed computation. Taken as a whole, these findings form a promising foundation for distributed machine learning over quantum networks."
Poster,Expressive Gaussian Human Avatars from Monocular RGB Video,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96763,"Hezhen Hu, Zhiwen Fan, Tianhao Wu, Yihan Xi, Seoyoung Lee, Georgios Pavlakos, Zhangyang &quot;Atlas&quot; Wang","Nuanced expressiveness, especially through detailed hand and facial expressions, is pivotal for enhancing the realism and vitality of digital human representations.In this work, we aim to learn expressive human avatars from a monocular RGB video; a setting that introduces new challenges in capturing and animating fine-grained details.To this end, we introduce EVA, a drivable human model that can recover fine details based on 3D Gaussians and an expressive parametric human model, SMPL-X.Focused on enhancing expressiveness, our work makes three key contributions.First, we highlight the importance of aligning the SMPL-X model with the video frames for effective avatar learning.Recognizing the limitations of current methods for estimating SMPL-X parameters from in-the-wild videos, we introduce a reconstruction module that significantly improves the image-model alignment.Second, we propose a context-aware adaptive density control strategy, which is adaptively adjusting the gradient thresholds to accommodate the varied granularity across body parts.Third, we develop a feedback mechanism that predicts per-pixel confidence to better guide the optimization of 3D Gaussians.Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach both quantitatively and qualitatively, especially on the fine-grained hand and facial details. We make our code available at the project website: https://evahuman.github.io."
