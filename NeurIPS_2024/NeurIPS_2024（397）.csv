Poster,Test-Time Dynamic Image Fusion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95415,"Bing Cao, Yinan Xia, Yi Ding, Changqing Zhang, Qinghua Hu","The inherent challenge of image fusion lies in capturing the correlation of multi-source images and comprehensively integrating effective information from different sources. Most existing techniques fail to perform dynamic image fusion while notably lacking theoretical guarantees, leading to potential deployment risks in this field. Is it possible to conduct dynamic image fusion with a clear theoretical justification? In this paper, we give our solution from a generalization perspective. We proceed to reveal the generalized form of image fusion and derive a new test-time dynamic image fusion paradigm. It provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error. Specifically, we decompose the fused image into multiple components corresponding to its source data. The decomposed components represent the effective information from the source data, thus the gap between them reflects the \textit{Relative Dominability} (RD) of the uni-source data in constructing the fusion image. Theoretically, we prove that the key to reducing generalization error hinges on the negative correlation between the RD-based fusion weight and the uni-source reconstruction loss. Intuitively, RD dynamically highlights the dominant regions of each source and can be naturally converted to the corresponding fusion weight, achieving robust results. Extensive experiments and discussions with in-depth analysis on multiple benchmarks confirm our findings and superiority. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yinan-Xia/TTD."
Poster,Test Where Decisions Matter: Importance-driven Testing for Deep Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95000,"Stefan Pranger, Hana Chockler, Martin Tappler, Bettina Könighofer","In many Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems, decisions in a trained policy vary in significance for the expected safety and performance of the policy. Since RL policies are very complex, testing efforts should concentrate on states in which the agent's decisions have the highest impact on the expected outcome. In this paper, we propose a novel model-based method to rigorously compute a ranking of state importance across the entire state space. We then focus our testing efforts on the highest-ranked states. In this paper, we focus on testing for safety. However, the proposed methods can be easily adapted to test for performance. In each iteration, our testing framework computes optimistic and pessimistic safety estimates. These estimates provide lower and upper bounds on the expected outcomes of the policy execution across all modeled states in the state space. Our approach divides the state space into safe and unsafe regions upon convergence, providing clear insights into the policy's weaknesses. Two important properties characterize our approach. (1) Optimal Test-Case Selection: At any time in the testing process, our approach evaluates the policy in the states that are most critical for safety. (2) Guaranteed Safety: Our approach can provide formal verification guarantees over the entire state space by sampling only a fraction of the policy. Any safety properties assured by the pessimistic estimate are formally proven to hold for the policy. We provide a detailed evaluation of our framework on several examples, showing that our method discovers unsafe policy behavior with low testing effort."
Poster,Tetrahedron Splatting for 3D Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95233,"Chun Gu, Zeyu Yang, Zijie Pan, Xiatian Zhu, Li Zhang","3D representation is essential to the significant advance of 3D generation with 2D diffusion priors. As a flexible representation, NeRF has been first adopted for 3D representation. With density-based volumetric rendering, it however suffers both intensive computational overhead and inaccurate mesh extraction. Using a signed distance field and Marching Tetrahedra, DMTet allows for precise mesh extraction and real-time rendering but is limited in handling large topological changes in meshes, leading to optimization challenges. Alternatively, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is favored in both training and rendering efficiency while falling short in mesh extraction. In this work, we introduce a novel 3D representation, Tetrahedron Splatting (TeT-Splatting), that supports easy convergence during optimization, precise mesh extraction, and real-time rendering simultaneously. This is achieved by integrating surface-based volumetric rendering within a structured tetrahedral grid while preserving the desired ability of precise mesh extraction, and a tile-based differentiable tetrahedron rasterizer. Furthermore, we incorporate eikonal and normal consistency regularization terms for the signed distance field to improve generation quality and stability. Critically, our representation can be trained without mesh extraction, making the optimization process easier to converge. Our TeT-Splatting can be readily integrated in existing 3D generation pipelines, along with polygonal mesh for texture optimization. Extensive experiments show that our TeT-Splatting strikes a superior tradeoff among convergence speed, render efficiency, and mesh quality as compared to previous alternatives under varying 3D generation settings."
Poster,Text2CAD: Generating Sequential CAD Designs from Beginner-to-Expert Level Text Prompts,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96571,"Mohammad Sadil Khan, Sankalp Sinha, Talha Uddin, Didier Stricker, Sk Aziz Ali, Muhammad Zeshan Afzal","Prototyping complex computer-aided design (CAD) models in modern softwares can be very time-consuming. This is due to the lack of intelligent systems that can quickly generate simpler intermediate parts. We propose Text2CAD, the first AI framework for generating text-to-parametric CAD models using designer-friendly instructions for all skill levels. Furthermore, we introduce a data annotation pipeline for generating text prompts based on natural language instructions for the DeepCAD dataset using Mistral and LLaVA-NeXT. The dataset contains $\sim170$K models and $\sim660$K text annotations, from abstract CAD descriptions (e.g., _generate two concentric cylinders_) to detailed specifications (e.g., _draw two circles with center_ $(x,y)$ and _radius_ $r_{1}$, $r_{2}$, \textit{and extrude along the normal by} $d$...). Within the Text2CAD framework, we propose an end-to-end transformer-based auto-regressive network to generate parametric CAD models from input texts. We evaluate the performance of our model through a mixture of metrics, including visual quality, parametric precision, and geometrical accuracy. Our proposed framework shows great potential in AI-aided design applications. Project page is available at https://sadilkhan.github.io/text2cad-project/."
Poster,Text2NKG: Fine-Grained N-ary Relation Extraction for N-ary relational Knowledge Graph Construction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94929,"Haoran Luo, Haihong E, Yuhao Yang, Tianyu Yao, Yikai Guo, Zichen Tang, Wentai Zhang, Shiyao Peng, Kaiyang Wan, Meina Song, Wei Lin, Yifan Zhu, Anh Tuan Luu","Beyond traditional binary relational facts, n-ary relational knowledge graphs (NKGs) are comprised of n-ary relational facts containing more than two entities, which are closer to real-world facts with broader applications. However, the construction of NKGs remains at a coarse-grained level, which is always in a single schema, ignoring the order and variable arity of entities. To address these restrictions, we propose Text2NKG, a novel fine-grained n-ary relation extraction framework for n-ary relational knowledge graph construction. We introduce a span-tuple classification approach with hetero-ordered merging and output merging to accomplish fine-grained n-ary relation extraction in different arity. Furthermore, Text2NKG supports four typical NKG schemas: hyper-relational schema, event-based schema, role-based schema, and hypergraph-based schema, with high flexibility and practicality. The experimental results demonstrate that Text2NKG achieves state-of-the-art performance in F1 scores on the fine-grained n-ary relation extraction benchmark. Our code and datasets are publicly available."
Poster,Text-Aware Diffusion for Policy Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93698,"Calvin Luo, Mandy He, Zilai Zeng, Chen Sun","Training an agent to achieve particular goals or perform desired behaviors is often accomplished through reinforcement learning, especially in the absence of expert demonstrations.  However, supporting novel goals or behaviors through reinforcement learning requires the ad-hoc design of appropriate reward functions, which quickly becomes intractable. To address this challenge, we propose Text-Aware Diffusion for Policy Learning (TADPoLe), which uses a pretrained, frozen text-conditioned diffusion model to compute dense zero-shot reward signals for text-aligned policy learning.  We hypothesize that large-scale pretrained generative models encode rich priors that can supervise a policy to behave not only in a text-aligned manner, but also in alignment with a notion of naturalness summarized from internet-scale training data.  In our experiments, we demonstrate that TADPoLe is able to learn policies for novel goal-achievement and continuous locomotion behaviors specified by natural language, in both Humanoid and Dog environments. The behaviors are learned zero-shot without ground-truth rewards or expert demonstrations, and are qualitatively more natural according to human evaluation. We further show that TADPoLe performs competitively when applied to robotic manipulation tasks in the Meta-World environment, without having access to any in-domain demonstrations."
Poster,TextCtrl: Diffusion-based Scene Text Editing with Prior Guidance Control,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95102,"Weichao Zeng, Yan Shu, Zhenhang Li, Dongbao Yang, Yu Zhou","Centred on content modification and style preservation, Scene Text Editing (STE) remains a challenging task despite considerable progress in text-to-image synthesis and text-driven image manipulation recently. GAN-based STE methods generally encounter a common issue of model generalization, while Diffusion-based STE methods suffer from undesired style deviations. To address these problems, we propose TextCtrl, a diffusion-based method that edits text with prior guidance control. Our method consists of two key components: (i) By constructing fine-grained text style disentanglement and robust text glyph structure representation,  TextCtrl explicitly incorporates Style-Structure guidance into model design and network training, significantly improving text style consistency and rendering accuracy. (ii) To further leverage the style prior, a Glyph-adaptive Mutual Self-attention mechanism is proposed which deconstructs the implicit fine-grained features of the source image to enhance style consistency and vision quality during inference. Furthermore, to fill the vacancy of the real-world STE evaluation benchmark, we create the first real-world image-pair dataset termed ScenePair for fair comparisons. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TextCtrl compared with previous methods concerning both style fidelity and text accuracy. Project page: https://github.com/weichaozeng/TextCtrl."
Poster,Text-DiFuse: An Interactive Multi-Modal Image Fusion Framework based on Text-modulated Diffusion Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93032,"Hao Zhang, Lei Cao, Jiayi Ma","Existing multi-modal image fusion methods fail to address the compound degradations presented in source images, resulting in fusion images plagued by noise, color bias, improper exposure, etc. Additionally, these methods often overlook the specificity of foreground objects, weakening the salience of the objects of interest within the fused images. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel interactive multi-modal image fusion framework based on the text-modulated diffusion model, called Text-DiFuse. First, this framework integrates feature-level information integration into the diffusion process, allowing adaptive degradation removal and multi-modal information fusion. This is the first attempt to deeply and explicitly embed information fusion within the diffusion process, effectively addressing compound degradation in image fusion. Second, by embedding the combination of the text and zero-shot location model into the diffusion fusion process, a text-controlled fusion re-modulation strategy is developed. This enables user-customized text control to improve fusion performance and highlight foreground objects in the fused images. Extensive experiments on diverse public datasets show that our Text-DiFuse achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance across various scenarios with complex degradation. Moreover, the semantic segmentation experiment validates the significant enhancement in semantic performance achieved by our text-controlled fusion re-modulation strategy. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Leiii-Cao/Text-DiFuse."
Poster,Text-Guided Attention is All You Need for Zero-Shot Robustness in Vision-Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94422,"Lu Yu, Haiyang Zhang, Changsheng Xu","Due to the impressive zero-shot capabilities, pre-trained vision-language models (e.g. CLIP), have attracted widespread attention and adoption across various domains. Nonetheless, CLIP has been observed to be susceptible to adversarial examples. Through experimental analysis, we have observed a phenomenon wherein adversarial perturbations induce shifts in text-guided attention. Building upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective strategy: Text-Guided Attention for Zero-Shot Robustness (TGA-ZSR). This framework incorporates two components: the Attention Refinement module and the Attention-based Model Constraint module. Our goal is to maintain the generalization of the CLIP model and enhance its adversarial robustness: The Attention Refinement module aligns the text-guided attention obtained from the target model via adversarial examples with the text-guided attention acquired from the original model via clean examples. This alignment enhances the model’s robustness. Additionally, the Attention-based Model Constraint module acquires text-guided attention from both the target and original models using clean examples. Its objective is to maintain model performance on clean samples while enhancing overall robustness. The experiments validate that our method yields a 9.58% enhancement in zero-shot robust accuracy over the current state-of-the-art techniques across 16 datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhyblue424/TGA-ZSR."
Poster,Text-Infused Attention and Foreground-Aware Modeling for Zero-Shot Temporal Action Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93890,"Yearang Lee, Ho-Joong Kim, Seong-Whan Lee","Zero-Shot Temporal Action Detection (ZSTAD) aims to classify and localize action segments in untrimmed videos for unseen action categories. Most existing ZSTAD methods utilize a foreground-based approach, limiting the integration of text and visual features due to their reliance on pre-extracted proposals. In this paper, we introduce a cross-modal ZSTAD baseline with mutual cross-attention, integrating both text and visual information throughout the detection process. Our simple approach results in superior performance compared to previous methods. Despite this improvement, we further identify a common-action bias issue that the cross-modal baseline over-focus on common sub-actions due to a lack of ability to discriminate text-related visual parts. To address this issue, we propose Text-infused attention and Foreground-aware Action Detection (Ti-FAD), which enhances the ability to focus on text-related sub-actions and distinguish relevant action segments from the background. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Ti-FAD outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on ZSTAD benchmarks by a large margin:  41.2\% (+ 11.0\%) on THUMOS14 and 32.0\% (+ 5.4\%) on ActivityNet v1.3.
