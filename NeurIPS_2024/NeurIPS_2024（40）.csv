Poster,Attack-Aware Noise Calibration for Differential Privacy,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94073,"Bogdan Kulynych, Juan Gomez, Georgios Kaissis, Flavio Calmon, Carmela Troncoso","Differential privacy (DP) is a widely used approach for mitigating privacy risks when training machine learning models on sensitive data. DP mechanisms add noise during training to limit the risk of information leakage. The scale of the added noise is critical, as it determines the trade-off between privacy and utility. The standard practice is to select the noise scale to satisfy a given privacy budget ε. This privacy budget is in turn interpreted in terms of operational attack risks, such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of inference attacks aimed to recoverinformation about the training data records. We show that first calibrating the noise scale to a privacy budget ε, and then translating ε to attack risk leads to overly conservative risk assessments and unnecessarily low utility. Instead, we propose methods to directly calibrate the noise scale to a desired attack risk level, bypassing the step of choosing ε. For a given notion of attack risk, our approach significantlydecreases noise scale, leading to increased utility at the same level of privacy. We empirically demonstrate that calibrating noise to attack sensitivity/specificity, rather than ε, when training privacy-preserving ML models substantially improves model accuracy for the same risk level. Our work provides a principled and practical way to improve the utility of privacy-preserving ML without compromising on privacy."
Poster,Attack-Resilient Image Watermarking Using Stable Diffusion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94294,"Lijun Zhang, Xiao Liu, Antoni Martin, Cindy Bearfield, Yuriy Brun, Hui Guan","Watermarking images is critical for tracking image provenance and proving ownership. With the advent of generative models, such as stable diffusion, that can create fake but realistic images, watermarking has become particularly important to make human-created images reliably identifiable. Unfortunately, the very same stable diffusion technology can remove watermarks injected using existing methods.To address this problem, we present ZoDiac, which uses a pre-trained stable diffusion model to inject a watermark into the trainable latent space, resulting in watermarks that can be reliably detected in the latent vector even when attacked. We evaluate ZoDiac on three benchmarks, MS-COCO, DiffusionDB, and WikiArt, and find that ZoDiac is robust against state-of-the-art watermark attacks, with a watermark detection rate above 98% and a false positive rate below 6.4%, outperforming state-of-the-art watermarking methods. We hypothesize that the reciprocating denoising process in diffusion models may inherently enhance the robustness of the watermark when faced with strong attacks and validate the hypothesis. Our research demonstrates that stable diffusion is a promising approach to robust watermarking, able to withstand even stable-diffusion-based attack methods. ZoDiac is open-sourced and available at https://github.com/zhanglijun95/ZoDiac."
Poster,Attention boosted Individualized Regression,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96287,"Guang Yang, Yuan Cao, Long Feng","Different from classical one-model-fits-all strategy, individualized models allow parameters to vary across samples and are gaining popularity in various fields, particularly in personalized medicine. Motivated by medical imaging analysis, this paper introduces a novel individualized modeling framework for matrix-valued data that does not require additional information on sample similarity for the individualized coefficients. Under our framework, the model individualization stems from an optimal internal relation map within the samples themselves. We refer to the proposed method as Attention boosted Individualized Regression, due to its close connections with the self-attention mechanism. Therefore, our approach provides a new interpretation for  attention from the perspective of individualized modeling. Comprehensive numerical experiments and real brain MRI analysis using an ADNI dataset demonstrated the superior performance of our model."
Poster,Attention Temperature Matters in ViT-Based Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93641,"Yixiong Zou, Ran Ma, Yuhua Li, Ruixuan Li","Cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) is proposed to transfer knowledge from large-scale source-domain datasets to downstream target-domain datasets with only a few training samples. However, Vision Transformer (ViT), as a strong backbone network to achieve many top performances, is still under-explored in the CDFSL task in its transferability against large domain gaps. In this paper, we find an interesting phenomenon of ViT in the CDFSL task: by simply multiplying a temperature (even as small as 0) to the attention in ViT blocks, the target-domain performance consistently increases, even though the attention map is downgraded to a uniform map. In this paper, we delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation. Through experiments, we interpret this phenomenon as a remedy for the ineffective target-domain attention caused by the query-key attention mechanism under large domain gaps. Based on it, we further propose a simple but effective method for the CDFSL task to boost ViT's transferability by resisting the learning of query-key parameters and encouraging that of non-query-key ones. Experiments on four CDFSL datasets validate the rationale of our interpretation and method, showing we can consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Zoilsen/Attn_Temp_CDFSL."
Poster,AttnDreamBooth: Towards Text-Aligned Personalized Text-to-Image Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96652,"Lianyu Pang, Jian Yin, Baoquan Zhao, Feize Wu, Fu Lee Wang, Qing Li, Xudong Mao","Recent advances in text-to-image models have enabled high-quality personalized image synthesis based on user-provided concepts with flexible textual control. In this work, we analyze the limitations of two primary techniques in text-to-image personalization: Textual Inversion and DreamBooth. When integrating the learned concept into new prompts, Textual Inversion tends to overfit the concept, while DreamBooth often overlooks it. We attribute these issues to the incorrect learning of the embedding alignment for the concept. To address this, we introduce AttnDreamBooth, a novel approach that separately learns the embedding alignment, the attention map, and the subject identity across different training stages. We also introduce a cross-attention map regularization term to enhance the learning of the attention map. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in identity preservation and text alignment compared to the baseline methods."
Poster,Attractor Memory for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting: A Chaos Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94220,"Jiaxi Hu, Yuehong HU, Wei Chen, Ming Jin, Shirui Pan, Qingsong Wen, Yuxuan Liang","In long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) tasks, an increasing number of works have acknowledged that discrete time series originate from continuous dynamic systems and have attempted to model their underlying dynamics. Recognizing the chaotic nature of real-world data, our model, Attraos, incorporates chaos theory into LTSF, perceiving real-world time series as low-dimensional observations from unknown high-dimensional chaotic dynamical systems. Under the concept of attractor invariance, Attraos utilizes non-parametric Phase Space Reconstruction embedding along with a novel multi-resolution dynamic memory unit to memorize historical dynamical structures, and evolves by a frequency-enhanced local evolution strategy. Detailed theoretical analysis and abundant empirical evidence consistently show that Attraos outperforms various LTSF methods on mainstream LTSF datasets and chaotic datasets with only one-twelfth of the parameters compared to PatchTST."
Poster,A two-scale Complexity Measure for Deep Learning Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95029,"Massimiliano Datres, Gian Leonardi, Alessio Figalli, David Sutter","We introduce a novel capacity measure 2sED for statistical models based on the effective dimension. The new quantity provably bounds the generalization error under mild assumptions on the model. Furthermore, simulations on standard data sets and popular model architectures show that 2sED correlates well with the training error. For Markovian models, we show how to efficiently approximate 2sED from below through a layerwise iterative approach, which allows us to tackle deep learning models with a large number of parameters. Simulation results suggest that the approximation is good for different prominent models and data sets."
Poster,AUC Maximization under Positive Distribution Shift,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93025,"Atsutoshi Kumagai, Tomoharu Iwata, Hiroshi Takahashi, Taishi Nishiyama, Yasuhiro Fujiwara","Maximizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is a popular approach to imbalanced binary classification problems. Existing AUC maximization methods usually assume that training and test distributions are identical. However, this assumption is often violated in practice due to {\it a positive distribution shift}, where the negative-conditional density does not change but the positive-conditional density can vary. This shift often occurs in imbalanced classification since positive data are often more diverse and time-varying than negative data. To deal with this shift, we theoretically show that the AUC on the test distribution can be expressed by using the positive and marginal training densities and the marginal test density. Based on this result, we can maximize the AUC on the test distribution by using positive and unlabeled data in the training distribution and unlabeled data in the test distribution. The proposed method requires only positive labels in the training distribution as supervision. Moreover, the derived AUC has a simple form and thus is easy to implement. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown with four real-world datasets."
Poster,AUCSeg: AUC-oriented Pixel-level Long-tail Semantic Segmentation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94250,"Boyu Han, Qianqian Xu, Zhiyong Yang, Shilong Bao, Peisong Wen, Yangbangyan Jiang, Qingming Huang","The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a well-known metric for evaluating instance-level long-tail learning problems. In the past two decades, many AUC optimization methods have been proposed to improve model performance under long-tail distributions. In this paper, we explore AUC optimization methods in the context of pixel-level long-tail semantic segmentation, a much more complicated scenario. This task introduces two major challenges for AUC optimization techniques. On one hand, AUC optimization in a pixel-level task involves complex coupling across loss terms, with structured inner-image and pairwise inter-image dependencies, complicating theoretical analysis. On the other hand, we find that mini-batch estimation of AUC loss in this case requires a larger batch size, resulting in an unaffordable space complexity. To address these issues, we develop a pixel-level AUC loss function and conduct a dependency-graph-based theoretical analysis of the algorithm's generalization ability. Additionally, we design a Tail-Classes Memory Bank (T-Memory Bank) to manage the significant memory demand. Finally, comprehensive experiments across various benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our proposed AUCSeg method. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/AUCSeg."
Poster,AuctionNet: A Novel Benchmark for Decision-Making in Large-Scale Games,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97717,"Kefan Su, Yusen Huo, ZHILIN ZHANG, Shuai Dou, Chuan Yu, Jian Xu, Zongqing Lu, Bo Zheng","Decision-making in large-scale games is an essential research area in artificial intelligence (AI) with significant real-world impact. However, the limited access to realistic large-scale game environments has hindered research progress in this area. In this paper, we present AuctionNet, a benchmark for bid decision-making in large-scale ad auctions derived from a real-world online advertising platform. AuctionNet is composed of three parts: an ad auction environment, a pre-generated dataset based on the environment, and performance evaluations of several baseline bid decision-making algorithms. More specifically, the environment effectively replicates the integrity and complexity of real-world ad auctions through the interaction of several modules: the ad opportunity generation module employs deep generative networks to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data while mitigating the risk of sensitive data exposure; the bidding module implements diverse auto-bidding agents trained with different decision-making algorithms; and the auction module is anchored in the classic Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction but also allows for customization of auction mechanisms as needed. To facilitate research and provide insights into the environment, we have also pre-generated a substantial dataset based on the environment. The dataset contains 10 million ad opportunities, 48 diverse auto-bidding agents, and over 500 million auction records. Performance evaluations of baseline algorithms such as linear programming, reinforcement learning, and generative models for bid decision-making are also presented as a part of AuctionNet. AuctionNet has powered the NeurIPS 2024 Auto-Bidding in Large-Scale Auctions competition, providing competition environments for over 1,500 teams. We believe that AuctionNet is applicable not only to research on bid decision-making in ad auctions but also to the general area of decision-making in large-scale games.
