Poster,Inverse M-Kernels for Linear Universal Approximators of Non-Negative Functions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94050,Hideaki Kim,"Kernel methods are widely utilized in machine learning field to learn, from training data, a latent function in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. It is well known that the approximator thus obtained usually achieves a linear representation, which brings various computational benefits, while maintaining great representation power (i.e., universal approximation). However, when non-negativity constraints are imposed on the function's outputs, the literature usually takes the kernel method-based approximators as offering linear representations at the expense of limited model flexibility or good representation power by allowing for their nonlinear forms. The main contribution of this paper is to derive a sufficient condition for a positive definite kernel so that it may construct flexible and linear approximators of non-negative functions. We call a kernel function that offers these attributes an *inverse M-kernel*; it is reminiscent of the inverse M-matrix. Furthermore, we show that for a one-dimensional input space, universal exponential/Abel kernels are inverse M-kernels and construct linear universal approximators of non-negative functions. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the existence of linear universal approximators of non-negative functions has been elucidated. We confirm the effectiveness of our results by experiments on the problems of non-negativity-constrained regression, density estimation, and intensity estimation. Finally, we discuss issues and perspectives on multi-dimensional input settings."
Poster,Inversion-based Latent Bayesian Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95013,"Jaewon Chu, Jinyoung Park, Seunghun Lee, Hyunwoo Kim","Latent Bayesian optimization (LBO) approaches have successfully adopted Bayesian optimization over a continuous latent space by employing an encoder-decoder architecture to address the challenge of optimization in a high dimensional or discrete input space. LBO learns a surrogate model to approximate the black-box objective function in the latent space. However, we observed that most LBO methods suffer from the `misalignment problem', which is induced by the reconstruction error of the encoder-decoder architecture. It hinders learning an accurate surrogate model and generating high-quality solutions. In addition, several trust region-based LBO methods select the anchor, the center of the trust region, based solely on the objective function value without considering the trust region's potential to enhance the optimization process. To address these issues, we propose $\textbf{Inv}$ersion-based Latent $\textbf{B}$ayesian $\textbf{O}$ptimization (InvBO), a plug-and-play module for LBO. InvBO consists of two components: an inversion method and a potential-aware trust region anchor selection. The inversion method searches the latent code that completely reconstructs the given target data. The potential-aware trust region anchor selection considers the potential capability of the trust region for better local optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of InvBO on nine real-world benchmarks, such as molecule design and arithmetic expression fitting tasks.

Poster,InversionView: A General-Purpose Method for Reading Information from Neural Activations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94390,"Xinting Huang, Madhur Panwar, Navin Goyal, Michael Hahn","The inner workings of neural networks can be better understood if we can fully decipher the information encoded in neural activations. In this paper, we argue that this information is embodied by the subset of inputs that give rise to similar activations.  We propose InversionView, which allows us to practically inspect this subset by sampling from a trained decoder model conditioned on activations. This helps uncover the information content of activation vectors, and facilitates understanding of the algorithms implemented by transformer models. We present four case studies where we investigate models ranging from small transformers to GPT-2. In these studies, we show that InversionView can reveal clear information contained in activations, including basic information about tokens appearing in the context, as well as more complex information, such as the count of certain tokens, their relative positions, and abstract knowledge about the subject. We also provide causally verified circuits to confirm the decoded information."
Poster,Invertible Consistency Distillation for Text-Guided Image Editing in Around 7 Steps,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94516,"Nikita Starodubcev, Mikhail Khoroshikh, Artem Babenko, Dmitry Baranchuk","Diffusion distillation represents a highly promising direction for achieving faithful text-to-image generation in a few sampling steps. However, despite recent successes, existing distilled models still do not provide the full spectrum of diffusion abilities, such as real image inversion, which enables many precise image manipulation methods. This work aims to enrich distilled text-to-image diffusion models with the ability to effectively encode real images into their latent space. To this end, we introduce invertible Consistency Distillation (iCD), a generalized consistency distillation framework that facilitates both high-quality image synthesis and accurate image encoding in only 3-4 inference steps. Though the inversion problem for text-to-image diffusion models gets exacerbated by high classifier-free guidance scales, we notice that dynamic guidance significantly reduces reconstruction errors without noticeable degradation in generation performance. As a result, we demonstrate that iCD equipped with dynamic guidance may serve as a highly effective tool for zero-shot text-guided image editing, competing with more expensive state-of-the-art alternatives."
Poster,Invisible Image Watermarks Are Provably Removable Using Generative AI,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96428,"Xuandong Zhao, Kexun Zhang, Zihao Su, Saastha Vasan, Ilya Grishchenko, Christopher Kruegel, Giovanni Vigna, Yu-Xiang Wang, Lei Li","Invisible watermarks safeguard images' copyrights by embedding hidden messages only detectable by owners. They also prevent people from misusing images, especially those generated by AI models.We propose a family of regeneration attacks to remove these invisible watermarks. The proposed attack method first adds random noise to an image to destroy the watermark and then reconstructs the image. This approach is flexible and can be instantiated with many existing image-denoising algorithms and pre-trained generative models such as diffusion models. Through formal proofs and extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that pixel-level invisible watermarks are vulnerable to this regeneration attack.Our results reveal that, across four different pixel-level watermarking schemes, the proposed method consistently achieves superior performance compared to existing attack techniques, with lower detection rates and higher image quality.However, watermarks that keep the image semantically similar can be an alternative defense against our attacks.Our finding underscores the need for a shift in research/industry emphasis from invisible watermarks to semantic-preserving watermarks.

Poster,IODA: Instance-Guided One-shot Domain Adaptation for Super-Resolution,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93485,"Zaizuo Tang, Yu-Bin Yang","The domain adaptation method effectively mitigates the negative impact of domain gaps on the performance of super-resolution (SR) networks through the guidance of numerous target domain low-resolution (LR) images. However, in real-world scenarios, the availability of target domain LR images is often limited, sometimes even to just one, which inevitably impairs the domain adaptation performance of SR networks. We propose Instance-guided One-shot Domain Adaptation for Super-Resolution (IODA) to enable efficient domain adaptation with only a single unlabeled target domain LR image. To address the limited diversity of the target domain distribution caused by a single target domain LR image, we propose an instance-guided target domain distribution expansion strategy. This strategy effectively expands the diversity of the target domain distribution by generating instance-specific features focused on different instances within the image. For SR tasks emphasizing texture details, we propose an image-guided domain adaptation method. Compared to existing methods that use text representation for domain difference, this method utilizes pixel-level representation with higher granularity, enabling efficient domain adaptation guidance for SR networks. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of IODA on multiple datasets and various network architectures, achieving satisfactory one-shot domain adaptation for SR networks. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZaizuoTang/IODA."
Poster,IPM-LSTM: A Learning-Based Interior Point Method for Solving Nonlinear Programs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96302,"Xi Gao, Jinxin Xiong, Akang Wang, qihong duan, Jiang Xue, Qingjiang Shi","Solving constrained nonlinear programs (NLPs) is of great importance in various domains such as power systems, robotics, and wireless communication networks. One widely used approach for addressing NLPs is the interior point method (IPM). The most computationally expensive procedure in IPMs is to solve systems of linear equations via matrix factorization. Recently, machine learning techniques have been adopted to expedite classic optimization algorithms. In this work, we propose using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to approximate the solution of linear systems and integrate this approximating step into an IPM. The resulting approximate NLP solution is then utilized to warm-start an interior point solver. Experiments on various types of NLPs, including Quadratic Programs and Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs, show that our approach can significantly accelerate NLP solving, reducing iterations by up to 60% and solution time by up to 70% compared to the default solver."
Poster,IPO: Interpretable Prompt Optimization for Vision-Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94834,"Yingjun Du, Wenfang Sun, Cees Snoek","Pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have remarkably adapted to various downstream tasks. Nonetheless, their performance heavily depends on the specificity of the input text prompts, which requires skillful prompt template engineering. Instead, current approaches to prompt optimization learn the prompts through gradient descent, where the prompts are treated as adjustable parameters. However, these methods tend to lead to overfitting of the base classes seen during training and produce prompts that are no longer understandable by humans. This paper introduces a simple but interpretable prompt optimizer (IPO), that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate textual prompts dynamically. We introduce a Prompt Optimization Prompt that not only guides LLMs in creating effective prompts but also stores past prompts with their performance metrics, providing rich in-context information. Additionally, we incorporate a large multimodal model (LMM) to condition on visual content by generating image descriptions, which enhance the interaction between textual and visual modalities. This allows for the creation of dataset-specific prompts that improve generalization performance, while maintaining human comprehension. Extensive testing across 11 datasets reveals that IPO not only improves the accuracy of existing gradient-descent-based prompt learning methods but also considerably enhances the interpretability of the generated prompts. By leveraging the strengths of LLMs, our approach ensures that the prompts remain human-understandable, thereby facilitating better transparency and oversight for vision-language models."
Poster,IQA-EVAL: Automatic Evaluation of Human-Model Interactive Question Answering,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95473,"Ruosen Li, Ruochen Li, Barry Wang, Xinya Du","To evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for question answering (QA), traditional methods typically focus on directly assessing the immediate responses generated by the models based on the given question and context. In the common use case of humans seeking AI assistant’s help in finding information, these non-interactive evaluations do not account for the dynamic nature of human-model conversations, and interaction-aware evaluations have shown that accurate models are not necessarily preferred by humans Lee et al. Recent works in human-computer interaction (HCI) have employed human evaluators to conduct interactions and evaluations, but they are often prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to scale. In this work, we introduce an automated evaluation framework IQA-EVAL to Interactive Question Answering Evaluations, more specifically, we introduce LLM-based Evaluation Agent (LEA) that can: (1) simulate human behaviors to generate interactions with IQA models; (2) automatically evaluate the generated interactions. Moreover, we propose assigning personas to LEAs to better simulate groups of real human evaluators. We show that: (1) our evaluation framework with GPT-4 (or Claude) as the backbone model achieves a high correlation with human evaluations on the IQA task; (2) assigning personas to LEA to better represent the crowd further significantly improves correlations. Finally, we use our automated metric to evaluate five recent LLMs with over 1000 questions from complex and ambiguous question answering tasks, which would cost $5k if evaluated by humans."
Poster,IRCAN: Mitigating Knowledge Conflicts in LLM Generation via Identifying and Reweighting Context-Aware Neurons,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94620,"Dan Shi, Renren Jin, Tianhao Shen, Weilong Dong, Xinwei Wu, Deyi Xiong","It is widely acknowledged that large language models (LLMs) encode a vast reservoir of knowledge after being trained on mass data. Recent studies disclose knowledge conflicts in LLM generation, wherein outdated or incorrect parametric knowledge (i.e., encoded knowledge) contradicts new knowledge provided in the context. To mitigate such knowledge conflicts, we propose a novel framework, IRCAN (Identifying and Reweighting Context-Aware Neurons) to capitalize on neurons that are crucial in processing contextual cues. Specifically, IRCAN first identifies neurons that significantly contribute to context processing, utilizing a context-aware attribution score derived from integrated gradients. Subsequently, the identified context-aware neurons are strengthened via reweighting. In doing so, we steer LLMs to generate context-sensitive outputs with respect to the new knowledge provided in the context. Extensive experiments conducted across a variety of models and tasks demonstrate that IRCAN not only achieves remarkable improvements in handling knowledge conflicts but also offers a scalable, plug-and-play solution that can be integrated seamlessly with existing models. Our codes are released at https://github.com/danshi777/IRCAN."
