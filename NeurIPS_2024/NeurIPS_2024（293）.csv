Poster,On the Necessity of Collaboration for Online Model Selection with Decentralized Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93244,"Junfan Li, Zheshun Wu, Zenglin Xu, Irwin King","We consider online model selection with decentralized data over $M$ clients, and study the necessity of collaboration among clients. Previous work proposed various federated algorithms without demonstrating their necessity, while we answer the question from a novel perspective of computational constraints. We prove lower bounds on the regret, and propose a federated algorithm and analyze the upper bound. Our results show (i) collaboration is unnecessary in the absence of computational constraints on clients; (ii) collaboration is necessary if the computational cost on each client is limited to $o(K)$, where $K$ is the number of candidate hypothesis spaces. We clarify the unnecessary nature of collaboration in previous federated algorithms for distributed online multi-kernel learning, and improve the regret bounds at a smaller computational and communication cost. Our algorithm relies on three new techniques including an improved Bernstein's inequality for martingale, a federated online mirror descent framework, and decoupling model selection and prediction, which might be of independent interest."
Poster,On the Noise Robustness of In-Context Learning for Text Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96962,"hongfu gao, Feipeng Zhang, Wenyu Jiang, Jun Shu, Feng Zheng, Hongxin Wei","Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on downstream tasks by in-context learning (ICL), which heavily relies on the quality of demonstrations selected from a large set of annotated examples. Recent works claim that in-context learning is robust to noisy demonstrations in text classification. In this work, we show that, on text generation tasks, noisy annotations significantly hurt the performance of in-context learning. To circumvent the issue, we propose a simple and effective approach called Local Perplexity Ranking (LPR), which replaces the ""noisy"" candidates with their nearest neighbors that are more likely to be clean. Our method is motivated by analyzing the perplexity deviation caused by noisy labels and decomposing perplexity into inherent perplexity and matching perplexity. Our key idea behind LPR is thus to decouple the matching perplexity by performing the ranking among the neighbors in semantic space. Our approach can prevent the selected demonstrations from including mismatched input-label pairs while preserving the effectiveness of the original selection methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LPR, improving the EM score by up to 18.75 on common benchmarks with noisy annotations."
Poster,On the Optimality of Dilated Entropy and Lower Bounds for Online Learning in Extensive-Form Games,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96527,"Zhiyuan Fan, Christian Kroer, Gabriele Farina","First-order methods (FOMs) are arguably the most scalable algorithms for equilibrium computation in large extensive-form games. To operationalize these methods, a distance-generating function, acting as a regularizer for the strategy space, must be chosen. The ratio between the strong convexity modulus and the diameter of the regularizer is a key parameter in the analysis of FOMs.A natural question is then: what is the optimal distance-generating function for extensive-form decision spaces? In this paper, we make a number of contributions, ultimately establishing that the weight-one dilated entropy (DilEnt) distance-generating function is optimal up to logarithmic factors. The DilEnt regularizer is notable due to its iterate-equivalence with Kernelized OMWU (KOMWU)---the algorithm with state-of-the-art dependence on the game tree size in extensive-form games---when used in conjunction with the online mirror descent (OMD) algorithm. However, the standard analysis for OMD is unable to establish such a result; the only current analysis is by appealing to the iterate equivalence to KOMWU. We close this gap by introducing a pair of primal-dual treeplex norms, which we contend form the natural analytic viewpoint for studying the strong convexity of DilEnt. Using these norm pairs, we recover the diameter-to-strong-convexity ratio that predicts the same performance as KOMWU. Along with a new regret lower bound for online learning in sequence-form strategy spaces, we show that this ratio is nearly optimal.Finally, we showcase our analytic techniques by refining the analysis of Clairvoyant OMD when paired with DilEnt, establishing an $\mathcal{O}(n \log |\mathcal{V}| \log T/T)$ approximation rate to coarse correlated equilibrium in $n$-player games, where $|\mathcal{V}|$ is the number of reduced normal-form strategies of the players, establishing the new state of the art."
Poster,On the Optimal Time Complexities in Decentralized Stochastic Asynchronous Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95763,"Alexander Tyurin, Peter Richtarik","We consider the decentralized stochastic asynchronous optimization setup, where many workers asynchronously calculate stochastic gradients and asynchronously communicate with each other using edges in a multigraph. For both homogeneous and heterogeneous setups, we prove new time complexity lower bounds under the assumption that computation and communication speeds are bounded by constants. After that, we developed a new nearly optimal method, Fragile SGD, and a new optimal method, Amelie SGD, that converge with arbitrary heterogeneous computation and communication speeds and match our lower bounds (up to a logarithmic factor in the homogeneous setting). Our time complexities are new, nearly optimal, and provably improve all previous asynchronous/synchronous stochastic methods in the decentralized setup."
Poster,On the Parameter Identifiability of Partially Observed Linear Causal Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96032,"Xinshuai Dong, Ignavier Ng, Biwei Huang, Yuewen Sun, Songyao Jin, Roberto Legaspi, Peter Spirtes, Kun Zhang","Linear causal models are important tools for modeling causal dependencies and yet in practice, only a subset of the variables can be observed. In this paper,  we examine the parameter identifiability of these models by investigating whether the edge coefficients can be recovered given the causal structure and partially observed data. Our setting is more general than that of prior research—we allow all variables, including both observed and latent ones, to be flexibly related, and we consider the coefficients of all edges, whereas most existing works focus only on the edges between observed variables. Theoretically, we identify three types of indeterminacy for the parameters in partially observed linear causal models. We then provide graphical conditions that are sufficient for all parameters to be identifiable and show that some of them are provably necessary. Methodologically, we propose a novel likelihood-based parameter estimation method that addresses the variance indeterminacy of latent variables in a specific way and can asymptotically recover the underlying parameters up to trivial indeterminacy. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our identifiability theory and the effectiveness of the proposed method in the finite-sample regime."
Poster,On the Power of Decision Trees in Auto-Regressive Language Modeling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93674,"Yulu Gan, Tomer Galanti, Tomaso Poggio, Eran Malach","Originally proposed for handling time series data, Auto-regressive Decision Trees (ARDTs) have not yet been explored for language modeling. This paper delves into both the theoretical and practical applications of ARDTs in this new context. We theoretically demonstrate that ARDTs can compute complex functions, such as simulating automata, Turing machines, and sparse circuits, by leveraging ""chain-of-thought"" computations. Our analysis provides bounds on the size, depth, and computational efficiency of ARDTs, highlighting their surprising computational power. Empirically, we train ARDTs on simple language generation tasks, showing that they can learn to generate  coherent and grammatically correct text on par with a smaller Transformer model. Additionally, we show that ARDTs can be used on top of transformer representations to solve complex reasoning tasks. This research reveals the unique computational abilities of ARDTs, aiming to broaden the architectural diversity in language model development."
Poster,On the Power of Small-size Graph Neural Networks for Linear Programming,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95370,"Qian Li, Tian Ding, Linxin Yang, Minghui Ouyang, Qingjiang Shi, Ruoyu Sun","Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for addressing complex optimization problems. It has been theoretically demonstrated that GNNs can universally approximate the solution mapping functions of linear programming (LP) problems. However, these theoretical results typically require GNNs to have large parameter sizes. Conversely, empirical experiments have shown that relatively small GNNs can solve LPs effectively, revealing a significant discrepancy between theoretical predictions and practical observations. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by providing a theoretical foundation for the effectiveness of small-size GNNs. We prove that polylogarithmic-depth, constant-width GNNs are sufficient to solve packing and covering LPs, two widely used classes of LPs. Our proof leverages the capability of GNNs to simulate a variant of the gradient descent algorithm on a carefully selected potential function. Additionally, we introduce a new GNN architecture, termed GD-Net. Experimental results demonstrate that GD-Net significantly outperforms conventional GNN structures while using fewer parameters."
Poster,"On the Reproducibility of: ""Learning Perturbations to Explain Time Series Predictions""",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/99345,"Jasper Eppink, Floris Six Dijkstra, Wouter Bant, Ádám Divák","Deep Learning models have taken the front stage in the AI community, yet explainability challenges hinder their widespread adoption. Time series models, in particular, lack attention in this regard. This study tries to reproduce and extend the work of Enguehard (2023b), focusing on time series explainability by incorporating learnable masks and perturbations. Enguehard (2023b) employed two methods to learn these masks and perturbations, the preservation game (yielding SOTA results) and the deletion game (with poor performance). We extend the work by revising the deletion game’s loss function, testing the robustness of the proposed method on a novel weather dataset, and visualizing the learned masks and perturbations. Despite notable discrepancies in results across many experiments, our findings demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms all baselines and exhibits robust performance across datasets. However, visualizations for the preservation game reveal that the learned perturbations primarily resemble a constant zero signal, questioning the importance of learning perturbations. Nevertheless, our revised deletion game shows promise, recovering meaningful perturbations and, in certain instances, surpassing the performance of the preservation game."
Poster,On the Robustness of Spectral Algorithms for Semirandom Stochastic Block Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93905,"Aditya Bhaskara, Agastya Jha, Michael Kapralov, Naren Manoj, Davide Mazzali, Weronika Wrzos-Kaminska","In a graph bisection problem, we are given a graph $G$ with two equally-sized unlabeled communities, and the goal is to recover the vertices in these communities. A popular heuristic, known as spectral clustering, is to output an estimated community assignment based on the eigenvector corresponding to the second-smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian of $G$. Spectral algorithms can be shown to provably recover the cluster structure for graphs generated from probabilistic models, such as the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). However, spectral clustering is known to be non-robust to model mis-specification. Techniques based on semidefinite programming have been shown to be more robust, but they incur significant computational overheads. In this work, we study the robustness of spectral algorithms against semirandom adversaries. Informally, a semirandom adversary is allowed to ``helpfully'' change the specification of the model in a way that is consistent with the ground-truth solution. Our semirandom adversaries in particular are allowed to add edges inside clusters or increase the probability that an edge appears inside a cluster. Semirandom adversaries are a useful tool to determine the extent to which an algorithm has overfit to statistical assumptions on the input. On the positive side, we identify a wide range of semirandom adversaries under which spectral bisection using the _unnormalized_ Laplacian is strongly consistent, i.e., it exactly recovers the planted partitioning. On the negative side, we show that in many of these settings, _normalized_ spectral bisection outputs a partitioning that makes a classification mistake on a constant fraction of the vertices. Finally, we demonstrate numerical experiments that complement our theoretical findings."
Poster,On the Role of Attention Masks and LayerNorm in Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93840,"Xinyi Wu, Amir Ajorlou, Yifei Wang, Stefanie Jegelka, Ali Jadbabaie","Self-attention is the key mechanism of transformers, which are the essential building blocks of modern foundation models. Recent studies have shown that pure self-attention suffers from an increasing degree of rank collapse as depth increases, limiting model expressivity and further utilization of model depth. The existing literature on rank collapse, however, has mostly overlooked other critical components in transformers that may alleviate the rank collapse issue. In this paper, we provide a general analysis of rank collapse under self-attention, taking into account the effects of attention masks and layer normalization (LayerNorm). In particular, we find that although pure masked attention still suffers from exponential collapse to a rank one subspace, sparse or local masked attention can provably slow down the collapse rate. In the case of self-attention with LayerNorm, we first show that for certain classes of value matrices, collapse to a rank one subspace still happens exponentially. However, through construction of nontrivial counterexamples, we then establish that with proper choice of value matrices, a general class of sequences may not converge to a rank one subspace, and the self-attention dynamics with LayerNorm can simultaneously possess a rich set of equilibria with any possible rank between one and full. Our result refutes the previous hypothesis that LayerNorm plays no role in the rank collapse of self-attention and suggests that self-attention with LayerNorm constitutes a much more expressive, versatile nonlinear dynamical system than what was originally thought."
