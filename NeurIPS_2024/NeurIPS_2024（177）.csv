Poster,Graph Neural Networks Need Cluster-Normalize-Activate Modules,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94196,"Arseny Skryagin, Felix Divo, Mohammad Amin Ali, Devendra S Dhami, Kristian Kersting","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are non-Euclidean deep learning models for graph-structured data. Despite their successful and diverse applications, oversmoothing prohibits deep architectures due to node features converging to a single fixed point. This severely limits their potential to solve complex tasks. To counteract this tendency, we propose a plug-and-play module consisting of three steps: Cluster→Normalize→Activate (CNA). By applying CNA modules, GNNs search and form super nodes in each layer, which are normalized and activated individually. We demonstrate in node classification and property prediction tasks that CNA significantly improves the accuracy over the state-of-the-art. Particularly, CNA reaches 94.18% and 95.75% accuracy on Cora and CiteSeer, respectively. It further benefits GNNs in regression tasks as well, reducing the mean squared error compared to all baselines. At the same time, GNNs with CNA require substantially fewer learnable parameters than competing architectures."
Poster,Graph Structure Inference with BAM: Neural Dependency Processing via Bilinear Attention,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96766,"Philipp Froehlich, Heinz Koeppl","Detecting dependencies among variables is a fundamental task across scientific disciplines. We propose a novel neural network model for graph structure inference, which aims to learn a mapping from observational data to the corresponding underlying dependence structures. The model is trained with variably shaped and coupled simulated input data and requires only a single forward pass through the trained network for inference. Central to our approach is a novel bilinear attention mechanism (BAM) operating on covariance matrices of transformed data while respecting the geometry of the manifold of symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. Inspired by graphical lasso methods, our model optimizes over continuous graph representations in the SPD space, where inverse covariance matrices encode conditional independence relations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the robustness of our method in detecting diverse dependencies, excelling in undirected graph estimation and showing competitive performance in completed partially directed acyclic graph estimation via a novel two-step approach. The trained model effectively detects causal relationships and generalizes well across different functional forms of nonlinear dependencies."
Poster,GraphTrail: Translating GNN Predictions into Human-Interpretable Logical Rules,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94172,"Burouj Armgaan, Manthan Dalmia, Sourav Medya, Sayan Ranu","Instance-level explanation of graph neural networks (GNNs) is a well-studied area. These explainers, however, only explain an instance (e.g., a graph) and fail to uncover the combinatorial reasoning learned by a GNN from the training data towards making its predictions. In this work, we introduce GraphTrail, the first end-to-end, global, post-hoc GNN explainer that translates the functioning of a black-box GNN model to a boolean formula over the (sub)graph level concepts without relying on local explainers. GraphTrail is unique in automatically mining the discriminative subgraph-level concepts using Shapley values. Subsequently, the GNN predictions are mapped to a human-interpretable boolean formula over these concepts through symbolic regression. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and GNN architectures demonstrate significant improvement over existing global explainers in mapping GNN predictions to faithful logical formulae. The robust and accurate performance of GraphTrail makes it invaluable for improving GNNs and facilitates adoption in domains with strict transparency requirements."
Poster,GraphVis: Boosting LLMs with Visual Knowledge Graph Integration,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94055,"Yihe Deng, Chenchen Ye, Zijie Huang, Mingyu Derek Ma, Yiwen Kou, Wei Wang","The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has expanded their capabilities across various data modalities, extending from well-established image data to increasingly popular graph data. Given the limitation of LLMs in hallucinations and inaccuracies in recalling factual knowledge, Knowledge Graph (KG) has emerged as a crucial data modality to support more accurate reasoning by LLMs. However, integrating structured knowledge from KGs into LLMs remains challenging, as most current KG-enhanced LLM methods directly convert the KG into linearized text triples, which is not as expressive as the original structured data. To address this, we introduce GraphVis, which conserves the intricate graph structure through the visual modality to enhance the comprehension of KGs with the aid of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). Our approach incorporates a unique curriculum fine-tuning scheme which first instructs LVLMs to recognize basic graphical features from the images, and subsequently incorporates reasoning on QA tasks with the visual graphs. This cross-modal methodology not only markedly enhances performance on standard textual QA  but also shows improved zero-shot VQA performance by utilizing synthetic graph images to augment the data for VQA tasks. We present comprehensive evaluations across commonsense reasoning QA benchmarks, where GraphVis provides an average improvement of 11.1% over its base model and outperforms existing KG-enhanced LLM approaches. Across VQA benchmarks such as ScienceQA that share similar scientific diagram images, GraphVis provides a notable gain of 4.32%."
Poster,Grasp as You Say: Language-guided Dexterous Grasp Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95221,"Yi-Lin Wei, Jian-Jian Jiang, Chengyi Xing, Xian-Tuo Tan, Xiao-Ming Wu, Hao Li, Mark Cutkosky, Wei-Shi Zheng","This paper explores a novel task ""Dexterous Grasp as You Say'' (DexGYS), enabling robots to perform dexterous grasping based on human commands expressed in natural language. However, the development of this field is hindered by the lack of datasets with natural human guidance; thus, we propose a language-guided dexterous grasp dataset, named DexGYSNet, offering high-quality dexterous grasp annotations along with flexible and fine-grained human language guidance. Our dataset construction is cost-efficient, with the carefully-design hand-object interaction retargeting strategy, and the LLM-assisted language guidance annotation system. Equipped with this dataset, we introduce the DexGYSGrasp framework for generating dexterous grasps based on human language instructions, with the capability of producing grasps that are intent-aligned, high quality and diversity. To achieve this capability, our framework decomposes the complex learning process into two manageable progressive objectives and introduce two components to realize them. The first component learns the grasp distribution focusing on intention alignment and generation diversity. And the second component refines the grasp quality while maintaining intention consistency. Extensive experiments are conducted on DexGYSNet and real world environments for validation."
Poster,Great Minds Think Alike: The Universal Convergence Trend of Input Salience,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96455,"Yipei Wang, Jeffrey Siskind, Xiaoqian Wang","Uncertainty is introduced in optimized DNNs through stochastic algorithms, forming specific distributions. Training models can be seen as random sampling from this distribution of optimized models. In this work, we study the distribution of optimized DNNs as a family of functions by leveraging a pointwise approach. We focus on the input saliency maps, as the input gradient field is decisive to the models' mathematical essence. Our investigation of saliency maps reveals a counter-intuitive trend: two stochastically optimized models tend to resemble each other more as either of their capacities increases. Therefore, we hypothesize several properties of these distributions, suggesting that (1) Within the same model architecture (e.g., CNNs, ResNets), different family variants (e.g., varying capacities) tend to align in terms of their population mean directions of the input salience. And (2) the distributions of optimized models follow a convergence trend to their shared population mean as the capacity increases. Furthermore, we also propose semi-parametric distributions based on the Saw distribution to model the convergence trend, satisfying all the counter-intuitive observations. Our experiments shed light on the significant implications of our hypotheses in various application domains, including black-box attacks, deep ensembles, etc. These findings not only enhance our understanding of DNN behaviors but also offer valuable insights for their practical application in diverse areas of deep learning."
Poster,GREAT Score: Global Robustness Evaluation of Adversarial Perturbation using Generative Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93184,"ZAITANG LI, Pin-Yu Chen, Tsung-Yi Ho","Current studies on adversarial robustness mainly focus on aggregating \textit{local} robustness results from a set of data samples to evaluate and rank different models. However, the local statistics may not well represent the true \textit{global} robustness of the underlying unknown data distribution. To address this challenge, this paper makes the first attempt to present a new framework, called \textit{GREAT Score}, for global robustness evaluation of adversarial perturbation using generative models. Formally, GREAT Score carries the physical meaning of a global statistic capturing a mean certified attack-proof perturbation level over all samples drawn from a generative model. For finite-sample evaluation, we also derive a probabilistic guarantee on the sample complexity and the difference between the sample mean and the true mean. GREAT Score has several advantages: (1) Robustness evaluations using GREAT Score are efficient and scalable to large models, by sparing the need of running adversarial attacks. In particular, we show high correlation and significantly reduced computation cost of GREAT Score when compared to the attack-based model ranking on RobustBench \cite{croce2021robustbench}. (2) The use of generative models facilitates the approximation of the unknown data distribution. In our ablation study with different generative adversarial networks (GANs), we observe consistency between global robustness evaluation and the quality of GANs. (3) GREAT Score can be used for remote auditing of privacy-sensitive black-box models, as demonstrated by our robustness evaluation on several online facial recognition services."
Poster,GREATS: Online Selection of High-Quality Data for LLM Training in Every Iteration,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96834,"Jiachen (Tianhao) Wang, Tong Wu, Dawn Song, Prateek Mittal, Ruoxi Jia","Online batch selection methods offer an adaptive alternative to static training data selection by dynamically selecting data batches during training. However, existing methods either rely on impractical reference models or simple heuristics that may not capture true data informativeness. To address these limitations, we propose \emph{GREedy Approximation Taylor Selection} (GREATS), a principled and efficient online batch selection method that applies greedy algorithm to optimize the data batch quality approximated by Taylor expansion. We develop a series of techniques to scale GREATS to large-scale model training. Extensive experiments with large language models (LLMs) demonstrate that GREATS significantly improves training convergence speed and generalization performance."
Poster,G-Retriever: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Textual Graph Understanding and Question Answering,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95524,"Xiaoxin He, Yijun Tian, Yifei Sun, Nitesh Chawla, Thomas Laurent, Yann LeCun, Xavier Bresson, Bryan Hooi","Given a graph with textual attributes, we enable users to `chat with their graph': that is, to ask questions about the graph using a conversational interface. In response to a user's questions, our method provides textual replies and highlights the relevant parts of the graph. While existing works integrate large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) in various ways, they mostly focus on either conventional graph tasks (such as node, edge, and graph classification), or on answering simple graph queries on small or synthetic graphs. In contrast, we develop a flexible question-answering framework targeting real-world textual graphs, applicable to multiple applications including scene graph understanding, common sense reasoning, and knowledge graph reasoning. Toward this goal, we first develop a Graph Question Answering (GraphQA) benchmark with data collected from different tasks. Then, we propose our \textit{G-Retriever} method, introducing the first retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach for general textual graphs, which can be fine-tuned to enhance graph understanding via soft prompting. To resist hallucination and to allow for textual graphs that greatly exceed the LLM's context window size, \textit{G-Retriever} performs RAG over a graph by formulating this task as a Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree optimization problem. Empirical evaluations show that our method outperforms baselines on textual graph tasks from multiple domains, scales well with larger graph sizes, and mitigates hallucination.~\footnote{Our codes and datasets are available at: \url{https://github.com/XiaoxinHe/G-Retriever}}"
Poster,Grid4D: 4D Decomposed Hash Encoding for High-Fidelity Dynamic Gaussian Splatting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94235,"Jiawei Xu, Zexin Fan, Jian Yang, Jin Xie","Recently, Gaussian splatting has received more and more attention in the field of static scene rendering. Due to the low computational overhead and inherent flexibility of explicit representations, plane-based explicit methods are popular ways to predict deformations for Gaussian-based dynamic scene rendering models. However, plane-based methods rely on the inappropriate low-rank assumption and excessively decompose the space-time 4D encoding, resulting in overmuch feature overlap and unsatisfactory rendering quality. To tackle these problems, we propose Grid4D, a dynamic scene rendering model based on Gaussian splatting and employing a novel explicit encoding method for the 4D input through the hash encoding. Different from plane-based explicit representations, we decompose the 4D encoding into one spatial and three temporal 3D hash encodings without the low-rank assumption. Additionally, we design a novel attention module that generates the attention scores in a directional range to aggregate the spatial and temporal features. The directional attention enables Grid4D to more accurately fit the diverse deformations across distinct scene components based on the spatial encoded features. Moreover, to mitigate the inherent lack of smoothness in explicit representation methods, we introduce a smooth regularization term that keeps our model from the chaos of deformation prediction. Our experiments demonstrate that Grid4D significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models in visual quality and rendering speed."
