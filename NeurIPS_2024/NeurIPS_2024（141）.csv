Poster,Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning For Continual Embodied Instruction Following,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95569,"Minjong Yoo, Jinwoo Jang, Wei-Jin Park, Honguk Woo","This study presents an Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP) framework, designed to tackle continual instruction following tasks of embodied agents in dynamic, non-stationary environments. The framework enhances Large Language Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently exploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context memory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying environment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following tasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context memory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently handle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously, we implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating the information-based exploration into the LLM-based planning process. Combined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not only allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental context memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves overall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a temporal consistency refinement scheme for query evaluation to address the inherent decay of knowledge in the memory. Through experiments with VirtualHome, ALFRED, and CARLA, our approach demonstrates robustness against a variety of embodied instruction following scenarios involving different instruction scales and types, and non-stationarity degrees, and it consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art LLM-based task planning approaches in terms of both goal success rate and execution efficiency."
Poster,Exploring Adversarial Robustness of Deep State Space Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95147,"Biqing Qi, Yiang Luo, Junqi Gao, Pengfei Li, Kai Tian, Zhiyuan Ma, Bowen Zhou","Deep State Space Models (SSMs) have proven effective in numerous task scenarios but face significant security challenges due to Adversarial Perturbations (APs) in real-world deployments. Adversarial Training (AT) is a mainstream approach to enhancing Adversarial Robustness (AR) and has been validated on various traditional DNN architectures. However, its effectiveness in improving the AR of SSMs remains unclear.While many enhancements in SSM components, such as integrating Attention mechanisms and expanding to data-dependent SSM parameterizations, have brought significant gains in Standard Training (ST) settings, their potential benefits in AT remain unexplored. To investigate this, we evaluate existing structural variants of SSMs with AT to assess their AR performance. We observe that pure SSM structures struggle to benefit from AT, whereas incorporating Attention yields a markedly better trade-off between robustness and generalization for SSMs in AT compared to other components. Nonetheless, the integration of Attention also leads to Robust Overfitting (RO) issues.To understand these phenomena, we empirically and theoretically  analyze the output error of SSMs under AP. We find that fixed-parameterized SSMs have output error bounds strictly related to their parameters, limiting their AT benefits, while input-dependent SSMs may face the problem of error explosion. Furthermore, we show that the Attention component effectively scales the output error of SSMs during training, enabling them to benefit more from AT, but at the cost of introducing RO due to its high model complexity.Inspired by this, we propose a simple and effective Adaptive Scaling (AdS) mechanism that brings AT performance close to Attention-integrated SSMs without introducing the issue of RO."
Poster,Exploring and Exploiting the Asymmetric Valley of Deep Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96141,"Xin-Chun Li, Jin-Lin Tang, Bo Zhang, Lan Li, De-Chuan Zhan","Exploring the loss landscape offers insights into the inherent principles of deep neural networks (DNNs). Recent work suggests an additional asymmetry of the valley beyond the flat and sharp ones, yet without thoroughly examining its causes or implications. Our study methodically explores the factors affecting the symmetry of DNN valleys, encompassing (1) the dataset, network architecture, initialization, and hyperparameters that influence the convergence point; and (2) the magnitude and direction of the noise for 1D visualization. Our major observation shows that the {\it degree of sign consistency} between the noise and the convergence point is a critical indicator of valley symmetry. Theoretical insights from the aspects of ReLU activation and softmax function could explain the interesting phenomenon. Our discovery propels novel understanding and applications in the scenario of Model Fusion: (1) the efficacy of interpolating separate models significantly correlates with their sign consistency ratio, and (2) imposing sign alignment during federated learning emerges as an innovative approach for model parameter alignment."
Poster,Exploring Behavior-Relevant and Disentangled Neural Dynamics with Generative Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93965,"Yule Wang, Chengrui Li, Weihan Li, Anqi Wu","Understanding the neural basis of behavior is a fundamental goal in neuroscience. Current research in large-scale neuro-behavioral data analysis often relies on decoding models, which quantify behavioral information in neural data but lack details on behavior encoding. This raises an intriguing scientific question: ""how can we enable in-depth exploration of neural representations in behavioral tasks, revealing interpretable neural dynamics associated with behaviors"". However, addressing this issue is challenging due to the varied behavioral encoding across different brain regions and mixed selectivity at the population level. To tackle this limitation, our approach, named (""BeNeDiff""), first identifies a fine-grained and disentangled neural subspace using a behavior-informed latent variable model. It then employs state-of-the-art generative diffusion models to synthesize behavior videos that interpret the neural dynamics of each latent factor. We validate the method on multi-session datasets containing widefield calcium imaging recordings across the dorsal cortex. Through guiding the diffusion model to activate individual latent factors, we verify that the neural dynamics of latent factors in the disentangled neural subspace provide interpretable quantifications of the behaviors of interest. At the same time, the neural subspace in BeNeDiff demonstrates high disentanglement and neural reconstruction quality."
Poster,Exploring Consistency in Graph Representations: from Graph Kernels to Graph Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94327,"Xuyuan Liu, Yinghao Cai, Qihui Yang, Yujun Yan","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a dominant approach in graph representation learning, yet they often struggle to capture consistent similarity relationships among graphs.  To capture similarity relationships, while graph kernel methods like the Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree (WL-subtree) and Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment (WLOA) perform effectively, they are heavily reliant on predefined kernels and lack sufficient non-linearities. Our work aims to bridge the gap between neural network methods and kernel approaches by enabling GNNs to consistently capture relational structures in their learned representations. Given the analogy between the message-passing process of GNNs and WL algorithms, we thoroughly compare and analyze the properties of WL-subtree and WLOA kernels. We find that the similarities captured by WLOA at different iterations are asymptotically consistent, ensuring that similar graphs remain similar in subsequent iterations, thereby leading to superior performance over the WL-subtree kernel. Inspired by these findings, we conjecture that the consistency in the similarities of graph representations across GNN layers is crucial in capturing relational structures and enhancing graph classification performance. Thus, we propose a loss to enforce the similarity of graph representations to be consistent across different layers. Our empirical analysis verifies our conjecture and shows that our proposed consistency loss can significantly enhance graph classification performance across several GNN backbones on various datasets."
Poster,Exploring Context Window of Large Language Models via Decomposed Positional Vectors,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92943,"Zican Dong, Junyi Li, Xin Men, Xin Zhao, Bingning Wang, Zhen Tian, weipeng chen, Ji-Rong Wen","Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) typically have a limited context window, resulting in significant performance degradation when processing text beyond the length of the context window. Extensive studies have been proposed to extend the context window and achieve length extrapolation of LLMs, but there is still a lack of in-depth interpretation of these approaches. In this study, we explore the positional information within and beyond the context window for deciphering the underlying mechanism of LLMs. By using a mean-based decomposition method, we disentangle positional vectors from hidden states of LLMs and analyze their formation and effect on attention. Furthermore, when texts exceed the context window, we analyze the change of positional vectors in two settings, i.e., direct extrapolation and context window extension. Based on our findings, we design two training-free context window extension methods, positional vector replacement and attention window extension. Experimental results show that our methods can effectively extend the context window length."
Poster,Exploring DCN-like architecture for fast image generation with arbitrary resolution,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94297,"Shuai Wang, Zexian Li, Tianhui Song, Xubin Li, Tiezheng Ge, Bo Zheng, Limin Wang","Arbitrary-resolution image generation still remains a challenging task in AIGC, as it requires handling varying resolutions and aspect ratios while maintaining high visual quality. Existing transformer-based diffusion methods suffer from quadratic computation cost and limited resolution extrapolation capabilities, making them less effective for this task. In this paper, we propose FlowDCN, a purely convolution-based generative model with linear time and memory complexity, that can efficiently generate high-quality images at arbitrary resolutions. Equipped with a new design of learnable group-wise deformable convolution block, our FlowDCN yields higher flexibility and capability to handle different resolutions with a single model.FlowDCN achieves the state-of-the-art 4.30 sFID on $256\times256$ ImageNet Benchmark and comparable resolution extrapolation results, surpassing transformer-based counterparts in terms of convergence speed (only $\frac{1}{5}$ images), visual quality, parameters ($8\%$ reduction) and FLOPs ($20\%$ reduction). We believe FlowDCN offers a promising solution to scalable and flexible image synthesis."
Poster,Exploring Fixed Point in Image Editing: Theoretical Support and Convergence Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96785,"Chen Hang, Zhe Ma, Haoming Chen, Xuwei Fang, Vincent Xie, Faming Fang, Guixu Zhang, Hongbin Wang","In image editing, Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion has become a widely adopted method and is extensively used in various image editing approaches. The core concept of DDIM inversion stems from the deterministic sampling technique of DDIM, which allows the DDIM process to be viewed as an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) process that is reversible. This enables the prediction of corresponding noise from a reference image, ensuring that the restored image from this noise remains consistent with the reference image. Image editing exploits this property by modifying the cross-attention between text and images to edit specific objects while preserving the remaining regions. However, in the DDIM inversion, using the $t-1$ time step to approximate the noise prediction at time step $t$ introduces errors between the restored image and the reference image. Recent approaches have modeled each step of the DDIM inversion process as finding a fixed-point problem of an implicit function. This approach significantly mitigates the error in the restored image but lacks theoretical support regarding the existence of such fixed points. Therefore, this paper focuses on the study of fixed points in DDIM inversion and provides theoretical support. Based on the obtained theoretical insights, we further optimize the loss function for the convergence of fixed points in the original DDIM inversion, improving the visual quality of the edited image. Finally, we extend the fixed-point based image editing to the application of unsupervised image dehazing, introducing a novel text-based approach for unsupervised dehazing."
Poster,"Exploring Jacobian Inexactness in Second-Order Methods for Variational Inequalities: Lower Bounds, Optimal Algorithms and Quasi-Newton Approximations",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93240,"Artem Agafonov, Petr Ostroukhov, Roman Mozhaev, Konstantin Yakovlev, Eduard Gorbunov, Martin Takac, Alexander Gasnikov, Dmitry Kamzolov","Variational inequalities represent a broad class of problems, including minimization and min-max problems, commonly found in machine learning. Existing second-order and high-order methods for variational inequalities require precise computation of derivatives, often resulting in prohibitively high iteration costs. In this work, we study the impact of Jacobian inaccuracy on second-order methods. For the smooth and monotone case, we establish a lower bound with explicit dependence on the level of Jacobian inaccuracy and propose an optimal algorithm for this key setting. When derivatives are exact, our method converges at the same rate as exact optimal second-order methods. To reduce the cost of solving the auxiliary problem, which arises in all high-order methods with global convergence, we introduce several Quasi-Newton approximations. Our method with Quasi-Newton updates achieves a global sublinear convergence rate. We extend our approach with a tensor generalization for inexact high-order derivatives and support the theory with experiments."
Poster,Exploring Low-Dimensional Subspace in Diffusion Models for Controllable Image Editing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96621,"Siyi Chen, Huijie Zhang, Minzhe Guo, Yifu Lu, Peng Wang, Qing Qu","Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models. Despite their success, there is still limited understanding of their semantic spaces. This makes it challenging to achieve precise and disentangled image generation without additional training, especially in an unsupervised way. In this work, we improve the understanding of their semantic spaces from intriguing observations: among a certain range of noise levels, (1) the learned posterior mean predictor (PMP) in the diffusion model is locally linear, and (2) the singular vectors of its Jacobian lie in low-dimensional semantic subspaces. We provide a solid theoretical basis to justify the linearity and low-rankness in the PMP. These insights allow us to propose an unsupervised, single-step, training-free **LO**w-rank **CO**ntrollable image editing (LOCO Edit) method for precise local editing in diffusion models. LOCO Edit identified editing directions with nice properties: homogeneity, transferability, composability, and linearity. These properties of LOCO Edit benefit greatly from the low-dimensional semantic subspace.Our method can further be extended to unsupervised or text-supervised editing in various text-to-image diffusion models (T-LOCO Edit). Finally, extensive empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LOCO Edit. The code and the arXiv version can be found on the [project website](https://chicychen.github.io/LOCO)."
