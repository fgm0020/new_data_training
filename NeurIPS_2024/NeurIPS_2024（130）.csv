Poster,EMR-Merging: Tuning-Free High-Performance Model Merging,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93822,"Chenyu Huang, Peng Ye, Tao Chen, Tong He, Xiangyu Yue, Wanli Ouyang","The success of pretrain-finetune paradigm brings about the release of numerous model weights. In this case, merging models finetuned on different tasks to enable a single model with multi-task capabilities is gaining increasing attention for its practicability. Existing model merging methods usually suffer from (1) significant performance degradation or (2) requiring tuning by additional data or training. In this paper, we rethink and analyze the existing model merging paradigm. We discover that using a single model's weights can hardly simulate all the models' performance. To tackle this issue, we propose Elect, Mask & Rescale-Merging (EMR-Merging). We first (a) elect a unified model from all the model weights and then (b) generate extremely lightweight task-specific modulators, including masks and rescalers, to align the direction and magnitude between the unified model and each specific model, respectively. EMR-Merging is tuning-free, thus requiring no data availability or any additional training while showing impressive performance. We find that EMR-Merging shows outstanding performance compared to existing merging methods under different classical and newly-established settings, including merging different numbers of vision models (up to 30), NLP models, PEFT models, and multi-modal models."
Poster,EMVP: Embracing Visual Foundation Model for Visual Place Recognition with Centroid-Free Probing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94922,"Qibo Qiu, Shun Zhang, Haiming Gao, Honghui Yang, Haochao Ying, Wenxiao Wang, Xiaofei He","Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is essential for mobile robots as it enables them to retrieve images from a database closest to their current location. The progress of Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) has significantly advanced VPR by capturing representative descriptors in images. However, existing fine-tuning efforts for VFMs often overlook the crucial role of probing in effectively adapting these descriptors for improved image representation. In this paper, we propose the Centroid-Free Probing (CFP) stage, making novel use of second-order features for more effective use of descriptors from VFMs. Moreover, to control the preservation of task-specific information adaptively based on the context of the VPR, we introduce the Dynamic Power Normalization (DPN) module in both the recalibration and CFP stages, forming a novel Parameter Efficiency Fine-Tuning (PEFT) pipeline (EMVP) tailored for the VPR task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed CFP over existing probing methods. Moreover, the EMVP pipeline can further enhance fine-tuning performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, it achieves 93.9\%, 96.5\%, and 94.6\% Recall@1 on the MSLS Validation, Pitts250k-test, and SPED datasets, respectively, while saving 64.3\% of trainable parameters compared with the existing SOTA PEFT method."
Poster,Enabling Adaptive Agent Training in Open-Ended Simulators by Targeting Diversity,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94744,"Robby Costales, Stefanos Nikolaidis","The wider application of end-to-end learning methods to embodied decision-making domains remains bottlenecked by their reliance on a superabundance of training data representative of the target domain.Meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) approaches abandon the aim of zero-shot *generalization*—the goal of standard reinforcement learning (RL)—in favor of few-shot *adaptation*, and thus hold promise for bridging larger generalization gaps.While learning this meta-level adaptive behavior still requires substantial data, efficient environment simulators approaching real-world complexity are growing in prevalence.Even so, hand-designing sufficiently diverse and numerous simulated training tasks for these complex domains is prohibitively labor-intensive.Domain randomization (DR) and procedural generation (PG), offered as solutions to this problem, require simulators to possess carefully-defined parameters which directly translate to meaningful task diversity—a similarly prohibitive assumption.In this work, we present **DIVA**, an evolutionary approach for generating diverse training tasks in such complex, open-ended simulators.Like unsupervised environment design (UED) methods, DIVA can be applied to arbitrary parameterizations, but can additionally incorporate realistically-available domain knowledge—thus inheriting the *flexibility* and *generality* of UED, and the supervised *structure* embedded in well-designed simulators exploited by DR and PG.Our empirical results showcase DIVA's unique ability to overcome complex parameterizations and successfully train adaptive agent behavior, far outperforming competitive baselines from prior literature.These findings highlight the potential of such *semi-supervised environment design* (SSED) approaches, of which DIVA is the first humble constituent, to enable training in realistic simulated domains, and produce more robust and capable adaptive agents.Our code is available at [https://github.com/robbycostales/diva](https://github.com/robbycostales/diva)."
Poster,ENAT: Rethinking Spatial-temporal Interactions in Token-based Image Synthesis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95289,"Zanlin Ni, Yulin Wang, Renping Zhou, Yizeng Han, Jiayi Guo, Zhiyuan Liu, Yuan Yao, Gao Huang","Recently, token-based generation approaches have demonstrated their effectiveness in synthesizing visual content. As a representative example, non-autoregressive Transformers (NATs) can generate decent-quality images in just a few steps. NATs perform generation in a progressive manner, where the latent tokens of a resulting image are incrementally revealed step-by-step. At each step, the unrevealed image regions are padded with [MASK] tokens and inferred by NAT, with the most reliable predictions preserved as newly revealed, visible tokens. In this paper, we delve into understanding the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of NATs and uncover two important interaction patterns that naturally emerge from NAT’s paradigm: Spatially (within a step), although [MASK] and visible tokens are processed uniformly by NATs, the interactions between them are highly asymmetric. In specific, [MASK] tokens mainly gather information for decoding. On the contrary, visible tokens tend to primarily provide information, and their deep representations can be built only upon themselves. Temporally (across steps), the interactions between adjacent generation steps mostly concentrate on updating the representations of a few critical tokens, while the computation for the majority of tokens is generally repetitive. Driven by these findings, we propose EfficientNAT (ENAT), a NAT model that explicitly encourages these critical interactions inherent in NATs. At the spatial level, we disentangle the computations of visible and [MASK] tokens by encoding visible tokens independently, while decoding [MASK] tokens conditioned on the fully encoded visible tokens. At the temporal level, we prioritize the computation of the critical tokens at each step, while maximally reusing previously computed token representations to supplement necessary information. ENAT improves the performance of NATs notably with significantly reduced computational cost. Experiments on ImageNet-256 2 & 512 2 and MS-COCO validate the effectiveness of ENAT. Code and pre-trained models will be released at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/ENAT."
Poster,End-To-End Causal Effect Estimation from Unstructured Natural Language Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94106,"Nikita Dhawan, Leonardo Cotta, Karen Ullrich, Rahul Krishnan, Chris Maddison","Knowing the effect of an intervention is critical for human decision-making, but current approaches for causal effect estimation rely on manual data collection and structuring, regardless of the causal assumptions. This increases both the cost and time-to-completion for studies. We show how large, diverse observational text data can be mined with large language models (LLMs) to produce inexpensive causal effect estimates under appropriate causal assumptions. We introduce _NATURAL_, a novel family of causal effect estimators built with LLMs that operate over datasets of unstructured text. Our estimators use LLM conditional distributions (over variables of interest, given the text data) to assist in the computation of classical estimators of causal effect. We overcome a number of technical challenges to realize this idea, such as automating data curation and using LLMs to impute missing information. We prepare six (two synthetic and four real) observational datasets, paired with corresponding ground truth in the form of randomized trials, which we used to systematically evaluate each step of our pipeline. NATURAL estimators demonstrate remarkable performance, yielding causal effect estimates that fall within 3 percentage points of their ground truth counterparts, including on real-world Phase 3/4 clinical trials. Our results suggest that unstructured text data is a rich source of causal effect information, and NATURAL is a first step towards an automated pipeline to tap this resource."
Poster,End-to-end Learnable Clustering for Intent Learning in Recommendation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96226,"Yue Liu, Shihao Zhu, Jun Xia, YINGWEI MA, Jian Ma, Xinwang Liu, Shengju Yu, Kejun Zhang, Wenliang Zhong","Intent learning, which aims to learn users' intents for user understanding and item recommendation, has become a hot research spot in recent years. However, existing methods suffer from complex and cumbersome alternating optimization, limiting performance and scalability. To this end, we propose a novel intent learning method termed \underline{ELCRec}, by unifying behavior representation learning into an \underline{E}nd-to-end \underline{L}earnable \underline{C}lustering framework, for effective and efficient \underline{Rec}ommendation. Concretely, we encode user behavior sequences and initialize the cluster centers (latent intents) as learnable neurons. Then, we design a novel learnable clustering module to separate different cluster centers, thus decoupling users' complex intents. Meanwhile, it guides the network to learn intents from behaviors by forcing behavior embeddings close to cluster centers. This allows simultaneous optimization of recommendation and clustering via mini-batch data. Moreover, we propose intent-assisted contrastive learning by using cluster centers as self-supervision signals, further enhancing mutual promotion. Both experimental results and theoretical analyses demonstrate the superiority of ELCRec from six perspectives. Compared to the runner-up, ELCRec improves NDCG@5 by 8.9\% and reduces computational costs by 22.5\% on the Beauty dataset. Furthermore, due to the scalability and universal applicability, we deploy this method on the industrial recommendation system with 130 million page views and achieve promising results. The codes are available on GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/yueliu1999/ELCRec}. A collection (papers, codes, datasets) of deep group recommendation/intent learning methods is available on GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/yueliu1999/Awesome-Deep-Group-Recommendation}."
Poster,End-to-End Ontology Learning with Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94942,"Andy Lo, Albert Q. Jiang, Wenda Li, Mateja Jamnik","Ontologies are useful for automatic machine processing of domain knowledge as they represent it in a structured format. Yet, constructing ontologies requires substantial manual effort. To automate part of this process, large language models (LLMs) have been applied to solve various subtasks of ontology learning. However, this partial ontology learning does not capture the interactions between subtasks. We address this gap by introducing OLLM, a general and scalable method for building the taxonomic backbone of an ontology from scratch. Rather than focusing on subtasks, like individual relations between entities, we model entire subcomponents of the target ontology by finetuning an LLM with a custom regulariser that reduces overfitting on high-frequency concepts. We introduce a novel suite of metrics for evaluating the quality of the generated ontology by measuring its semantic and structural similarity to the ground truth. In contrast to standard metrics, our metrics use deep learning techniques to define more robust distance measures between graphs. Both our quantitative and qualitative results on Wikipedia show that OLLM outperforms subtask composition methods, producing more semantically accurate ontologies while maintaining structural integrity. We further demonstrate that our model can be effectively adapted to new domains, like arXiv, needing only a small number of training examples. Our source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/andylolu2/ollm."
Poster,End-to-End Video Semantic Segmentation in Adverse Weather using Fusion Blocks and Temporal-Spatial Teacher-Student Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93543,"Xin Yang, YAN WENDING, Michael Bi Mi, Yuan Yuan, Robby Tan","Adverse weather conditions can significantly degrade the video frames, causing existing video semantic segmentation methods to produce erroneous predictions. In this work, we target adverse weather conditions and introduce an end-to-end domain adaptation strategy that leverages a fusion block, temporal-spatial teacher-student learning, and a temporal weather degradation augmentation approach. The fusion block integrates temporal information from adjacent frames at the feature level, trained end-to-end, eliminating the need for pretrained optical flow, distinguishing our method from existing approaches. Our teacher-student approach involves two teachers: one focuses on exploring temporal information from adjacent frames, and the other harnesses spatial information from the current frame. Finally, we apply temporal weather degradation augmentation to consecutive frames to more accurately represent adverse weather degradations. Our method achieves a performance of 25.4 and 33.0 mIoU on the adaptation from VIPER and Synthia to MVSS, respectively, representing an improvement of 4.3 and 5.8 mIoU over the existing state-of-the-art method."
Poster,Energy-based Epistemic Uncertainty for Graph Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96491,"Dominik Fuchsgruber, Tom Wollschläger, Stephan Günnemann","In domains with interdependent data, such as graphs, quantifying the epistemic uncertainty of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) is challenging as uncertainty can arise at different structural scales. Existing techniques neglect this issue or only distinguish between structure-aware and structure-agnostic uncertainty without combining them into a single measure. We propose GEBM, an energy-based model (EBM) that provides high-quality uncertainty estimates by aggregating energy at different structural levels that naturally arise from graph diffusion. In contrast to logit-based EBMs, we provably induce an integrable density in the data space by regularizing the energy function. We introduce an evidential interpretation of our EBM that significantly improves the predictive robustness of the GNN. Our framework is a simple and effective post hoc method applicable to any pre-trained GNN that is sensitive to various distribution shifts. It consistently achieves the best separation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution data on 6 out of 7 anomaly types while having the best average rank over shifts on *all* datasets."
Poster,Energy-based Hopfield Boosting for Out-of-Distribution Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94909,"Claus Hofmann, Simon Schmid, Bernhard Lehner, Daniel Klotz, Sepp Hochreiter","Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical when deploying machine learning models in the real world. Outlier exposure methods, which incorporate auxiliary outlier data in the training process, can drastically improve OOD detection performance compared to approaches without advanced training strategies. We introduce Hopfield Boosting, a boosting approach, which leverages modern Hopfield energy to sharpen the decision boundary between the in-distribution and OOD data. Hopfield Boosting encourages the model to focus on hard-to-distinguish auxiliary outlier examples that lie close to the decision boundary between in-distribution and auxiliary outlier data. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art in OOD detection with outlier exposure, improving the FPR95 from 2.28 to 0.92 on CIFAR-10, from 11.76 to 7.94 on CIFAR-100, and from 50.74 to 36.60 on ImageNet-1K."
