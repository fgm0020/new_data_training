Poster,Evaluating language models as risk scores,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97490,"André F. Cruz, Moritz Hardt, Celestine Mendler-Dünner","Current question-answering benchmarks predominantly focus on accuracy in realizable prediction tasks.Conditioned on a question and answer-key, does the most likely token match the ground truth?Such benchmarks necessarily fail to evaluate LLMs' ability to quantify ground-truth outcome uncertainty.In this work, we focus on the use of LLMs as risk scores for unrealizable prediction tasks.We introduce folktexts, a software package to systematically generate risk scores using LLMs, and evaluate them against US Census data products.A flexible API enables the use of different prompting schemes, local or web-hosted models, and diverse census columns that can be used to compose custom prediction tasks.We evaluate 17 recent LLMs across five proposed benchmark tasks.We find that zero-shot risk scores produced by multiple-choice question-answering have high predictive signal but are widely miscalibrated.Base models consistently overestimate outcome uncertainty, while instruction-tuned models underestimate uncertainty and produce over-confident risk scores.In fact, instruction-tuning polarizes answer distribution regardless of true underlying data uncertainty.This reveals a general inability of instruction-tuned models to express data uncertainty using multiple-choice answers.A separate experiment using verbalized chat-style risk queries yields substantially improved calibration across instruction-tuned models.These differences in ability to quantify data uncertainty cannot be revealed in realizable settings, and highlight a blind-spot in the current evaluation ecosystem that folktexts covers."
Poster,Evaluating Large Vision-and-Language Models on Children's Mathematical Olympiads,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97639,"Anoop Cherian, Kuan-Chuan Peng, Suhas Lohit, Joanna Matthiesen, Kevin Smith, Josh Tenenbaum","Recent years have seen a significant progress in the general-purpose problem solving abilities of large vision and language models (LVLMs), such as ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.; some of these breakthroughs even seem to enable AI models to outperform human abilities in varied tasks that demand higher-order cognitive skills. Are the current large AI models indeed capable of generalized problem solving as humans do?  A systematic analysis of AI capabilities for joint vision and text reasoning, however, is missing in the current scientific literature. In this paper, we make an effort towards filling this gap, by evaluating state-of-the-art LVLMs on their mathematical and algorithmic reasoning abilities using visuo-linguistic problems from children's Olympiads. Specifically, we consider problems from the Mathematical Kangaroo (MK) Olympiad, which is a popular international competition targeted at children from grades 1-12, that tests children's deeper mathematical abilities using puzzles that are appropriately gauged to their age and skills. Using the puzzles from MK, we created a dataset, dubbed SMART-840, consisting of 840 problems from years 2020-2024. With our dataset, we analyze LVLMs power on mathematical reasoning; their responses on our puzzles offer a direct way to compare against that of children. Our results show that modern LVLMs do demonstrate increasingly powerful reasoning skills in solving problems for higher grades, but lack the foundations to correctly answer problems designed for younger children. Further analysis shows that there is no significant correlation between the reasoning capabilities of AI models and that of young children, and their capabilities appear to be based on a different type of reasoning than the cumulative knowledge that underlies children's mathematical skills."
Poster,Evaluating Multiview Object Consistency in Humans and Image Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97465,"Tyler Bonnen, Stephanie Fu, Yutong Bai, Thomas O&#x27;Connell, Yoni Friedman, Nancy Kanwisher, Josh Tenenbaum, Alexei Efros","We introduce a benchmark to directly evaluate the alignment between human observers and vision models on a 3D shape inference task. We leverage an experimental design from the cognitive sciences: given a set of images, participants identify which contain the same/different objects, despite considerable viewpoint variation. We draw from a diverse range of images that include common objects (e.g., chairs) as well as abstract shapes (i.e., procedurally generated 'nonsense' objects). After constructing over 2000 unique image sets, we administer these tasks to human participants, collecting 35K trials of behavioral data from over 500 participants. This includes explicit choice behaviors as well as intermediate measures, such as reaction time and gaze data. We then evaluate the performance of common vision models (e.g., DINOv2, MAE, CLIP). We find that humans outperform all models by a wide margin. Using a multi-scale evaluation approach, we identify underlying similarities and differences between models and humans: while human-model performance is correlated, humans allocate more time/processing on challenging trials. All images, data, and code can be accessed via our project page."
Poster,Evaluating Numerical Reasoning in Text-to-Image Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97661,"Ivana Kajić, Olivia Wiles, Isabela Albuquerque, Matthias Bauer, Su Wang, Jordi Pont-Tuset, Aida Nematzadeh","Text-to-image generative models are capable of producing high-quality images that often faithfully depict concepts described using natural language. In this work, we comprehensively evaluate a range of text-to-image models on numerical reasoning tasks of varying difficulty, and show that even the most advanced models have only rudimentary numerical skills. Specifically, their ability to correctly generate an exact number of objects in an image is limited to small numbers, it is highly dependent on the context the number term appears in, and it deteriorates quickly with each successive number. We also demonstrate that models have poor understanding of linguistic quantifiers (such as “few” or “as many as”), the concept of zero, and struggle with more advanced concepts such as fractional representations. We bundle prompts, generated images and human annotations into GeckoNum, a novel benchmark for evaluation of numerical reasoning."
Poster,Evaluating the design space of diffusion-based generative models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96320,"Yuqing Wang, Ye He, Molei Tao","Most existing theoretical investigations of the accuracy of diffusion models, albeit significant, assume the score function has been approximated to a certain accuracy, and then use this a priori bound to control the error of generation. This article instead provides a first quantitative understanding of the whole generation process, i.e., both training and sampling. More precisely, it conducts a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of denoising score matching under gradient descent. In addition, a refined sampling error analysis for variance exploding models is also provided. The combination of these two results yields a full error analysis, which elucidates (again, but this time theoretically) how to design the training and sampling processes for effective generation. For instance, our theory implies a preference toward noise distribution and loss weighting in training that qualitatively agree with the ones used in [Karras et al., 2022]. It also provides perspectives on the choices of time and variance schedules in sampling: when the score is well trained, the design in [Song et al., 2021] is more preferable, but when it is less trained, the design in [Karras et al., 2022] becomes more preferable."
Poster,Evaluating the World Model Implicit in a Generative Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94550,"Keyon Vafa, Justin Chen, Ashesh Rambachan, Jon Kleinberg, Sendhil Mullainathan","Recent work suggests that large language models may implicitly learn world models. How should we assess this possibility? We formalize this question for the case where the underlying reality is governed by a deterministic finite automaton. This includes problems as diverse as simple logical reasoning, geographic navigation, game-playing, and chemistry. We propose new evaluation metrics for world model recovery inspired by the classic Myhill-Nerode theorem from language theory. We illustrate their utility in three domains: game playing, logic puzzles, and navigation. In all domains, the generative models we consider do well on existing diagnostics for assessing world models, but our evaluation metrics reveal their world models to be far less coherent than they appear. Such incoherence creates fragility: using a generative model to solve related but subtly different tasks can lead to failures. Building generative models that meaningfully capture the underlying logic of the domains they model would be immensely valuable; our results suggest new ways to assess how close a given model is to that goal."
Poster,Evaluation of Text-to-Video Generation Models: A Dynamics Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93313,"Mingxiang Liao, hannan lu, Qixiang Ye, Wangmeng Zuo, Fang Wan, Tianyu Wang, Yuzhong Zhao, Jingdong Wang, Xinyu Zhang","Comprehensive and constructive evaluation protocols play an important role when developing sophisticated text-to-video (T2V) generation models. Existing evaluation protocols primarily focus on temporal consistency and content continuity, yet largely ignore dynamics of video content. Such dynamics is an essential dimension measuring the visual vividness and the honesty of video content to text prompts. In this study, we propose an effective evaluation protocol, termed DEVIL, which centers on the dynamics dimension to evaluate T2V generation models, as well as improving existing evaluation metrics. In practice, we define a set of dynamics scores corresponding to multiple temporal granularities, and a new benchmark of text prompts under multiple dynamics grades. Upon the text prompt benchmark, we assess the generation capacity of T2V models, characterized by metrics of dynamics ranges and T2V alignment. Moreover, we analyze the relevance of existing metrics to dynamics metrics, improving them from the perspective of dynamics. Experiments show that DEVIL evaluation metrics enjoy up to about 90\% consistency with human ratings, demonstrating the potential to advance T2V generation models."
Poster,Even Sparser Graph Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95681,"Hamed Shirzad, Honghao Lin, Balaji Venkatachalam, Ameya Velingker, David Woodruff, Danica J. Sutherland","Graph Transformers excel in long-range dependency modeling, but generally require quadratic memory complexity in the number of nodes in an input graph, and hence have trouble scaling to large graphs. Sparse attention variants such as Exphormer can help, but may require high-degree augmentations to the input graph for good performance, and do not attempt to sparsify an already-dense input graph. As the learned attention mechanisms tend to use few of these edges, however, such high-degree connections may be unnecessary. We show (empirically and with theoretical backing) that attention scores on graphs are usually quite consistent across network widths, and use this observation to propose a two-stage procedure, which we call Spexphormer: first, train a narrow network on the full augmented graph. Next, use only the active connections to train a wider network on a much sparser graph. We establish theoretical conditions when a narrow network's attention scores can match those of a wide network, and show that Spexphormer achieves good performance with drastically reduced memory requirements on various graph datasets."
Poster,Event-3DGS: Event-based 3D Reconstruction Using 3D Gaussian Splatting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96044,"Haiqian Han, Jianing Li, Henglu Wei, Xiangyang Ji","Event cameras, offering high temporal resolution and high dynamic range, have brought a new perspective to addressing 3D reconstruction challenges in fast-motion and low-light scenarios. Most methods use the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) for event-based photorealistic 3D reconstruction. However, these NeRF methods suffer from time-consuming training and inference, as well as limited scene-editing capabilities of implicit representations. To address these problems, we propose Event-3DGS, the first event-based reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) for synthesizing novel views freely from event streams. Technically, we first propose an event-based 3DGS framework that directly processes event data and reconstructs 3D scenes by simultaneously optimizing scenario and sensor parameters. Then, we present a high-pass filter-based photovoltage estimation module, which effectively reduces noise in event data to improve the robustness of our method in real-world scenarios. Finally, we design an event-based 3D reconstruction loss to optimize the parameters of our method for better reconstruction quality. The results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction quality on both simulated and real-world datasets. We also verify that our method can perform robust 3D reconstruction even in real-world scenarios with extreme noise, fast motion, and low-light conditions. Our code is available in https://github.com/lanpokn/Event-3DGS."
Poster,Everyday Object Meets Vision-and-Language Navigation Agent via Backdoor,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93433,"Keji He, Kehan Chen, Jiawang Bai, Yan Huang, Qi Wu, Shu-Tao Xia, Liang Wang","Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to dynamically explore environments following natural language.The VLN agent, closely integrated into daily lives, poses a substantial threat to the security of privacy and property upon the occurrence of malicious behavior.However, this serious issue has long been overlooked.In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of an object-aware backdoored VLN, achieved by implanting object-aware backdoors during the training phase. Tailored to the unique VLN nature of cross-modality and continuous decision-making, we propose a novel backdoored VLN paradigm: IPR Backdoor. This enables the agent to act in abnormal behavior once encountering the object triggers during language-guided navigation in unseen environments, thereby executing an attack on the target scene.Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both physical and digital spaces across different VLN agents, as well as its robustness to various visual and textual variations. Additionally, our method also well ensures navigation performance in normal scenarios with remarkable stealthiness."
