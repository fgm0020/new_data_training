Poster,Spike-based Neuromorphic Model for Sound Source Localization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96112,"Dehao Zhang, Shuai Wang, Ammar Belatreche, Wenjie Wei, Yichen Xiao, Haorui Zheng, Zijian Zhou, Malu Zhang, Yang Yang","Biological systems possess remarkable sound source localization (SSL) capabilities that are critical for survival in complex environments. This ability arises from the collaboration between the auditory periphery, which encodes sound as precisely timed spikes, and the auditory cortex, which performs spike-based computations. Inspired by these biological mechanisms, we propose a novel neuromorphic SSL framework that integrates spike-based neural encoding and computation. The framework employs Resonate-and-Fire (RF) neurons with a phase-locking coding (RF-PLC) method to achieve energy-efficient audio processing. The RF-PLC method leverages the resonance properties of RF neurons to efficiently convert audio signals to time-frequency representation and encode interaural time difference (ITD) cues into discriminative spike patterns. In addition, biological adaptations like frequency band selectivity and short-term memory effectively filter out many environmental noises, enhancing SSL capabilities in real-world settings. Inspired by these adaptations, we propose a spike-driven multi-auditory attention (MAA) module that significantly improves both the accuracy and robustness of the proposed SSL framework. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that our SSL framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in SSL tasks. Furthermore, it shows exceptional noise robustness and maintains high accuracy even at very low signal-to-noise ratios. By mimicking biological hearing, this neuromorphic approach contributes to the development of high-performance and explainable artificial intelligence systems capable of superior performance in real-world environments."
Poster,SpikedAttention: Training-Free and Fully Spike-Driven Transformer-to-SNN Conversion with Winner-Oriented Spike Shift for Softmax Operation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94181,"Sangwoo Hwang, Seunghyun Lee, Dahoon Park, Donghun Lee, Jaeha Kung","Event-driven spiking neural networks(SNNs) are promising neural networks that reduce the energy consumption of continuously growing AI models. Recently, keeping pace with the development of transformers, transformer-based SNNs were presented. Due to the incompatibility of self-attention with spikes, however, existing transformer-based SNNs limit themselves by either restructuring self-attention architecture or conforming to non-spike computations. In this work, we propose a novel transformer-to-SNN conversion method that outputs an end-to-end spike-based transformer, named SpikedAttention. Our method directly converts the well-trained transformer without modifying its attention architecture. For the vision task, the proposed method converts Swin Transformer into an SNN without post-training or conversion-aware training, achieving state-of-the-art SNN accuracy on ImageNet dataset, i.e., 80.0\% with 28.7M parameters. Considering weight accumulation, neuron potential update, and on-chip data movement, SpikedAttention reduces energy consumption by 42\% compared to the baseline ANN, i.e., Swin-T. Furthermore, for the first time, we demonstrate that SpikedAttention successfully converts a BERT model to an SNN with only 0.3\% accuracy loss on average consuming 58\% less energy on GLUE benchmark. Our code is available at Github ( https://github.com/sangwoohwang/SpikedAttention )."
Poster,SpikeReveal: Unlocking Temporal Sequences from Real Blurry Inputs with Spike Streams,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96319,"Kang Chen, Shiyan Chen, Jiyuan Zhang, Baoyue Zhang, Yajing Zheng, Tiejun Huang, Zhaofei Yu","Reconstructing a sequence of sharp images from the blurry input is crucial for enhancing our insights into the captured scene and poses a significant challenge due to the limited temporal features embedded in the image. Spike cameras, sampling at rates up to 40,000 Hz, have proven effective in capturing motion features and beneficial for solving this ill-posed problem. Nonetheless, existing methods fall into the supervised learning paradigm, which suffers from notable performance degradation when applied to real-world scenarios that diverge from the synthetic training data domain. To address these challenges, we propose the first self-supervised framework for the task of spike-guided motion deblurring. Our approach begins with the formulation of a spike-guided deblurring model that explores the theoretical relationships among spike streams, blurry images, and their corresponding sharp sequences. We subsequently develop a self-supervised cascaded framework to alleviate the issues of spike noise and spatial-resolution mismatching encountered in the deblurring model. With knowledge distillation and re-blurring loss, we further design a lightweight deblur network to generate high-quality sequences with brightness and texture consistency with the original input. Quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on our real-world and synthetic datasets with spikes validate the superior generalization of the proposed framework. Our code, data and trained models are available at \url{https://github.com/chenkang455/S-SDM}."
Poster,Spiking Graph Neural Network on Riemannian Manifolds,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94910,"Li Sun, Zhenhao Huang, Qiqi Wan, Hao Peng, Philip S Yu","Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the dominant solution for learning on graphs, the typical non-Euclidean structures. Conventional GNNs, constructed with the Artificial Neuron Network (ANN), have achieved impressive performance at the cost of high computation and energy consumption. In parallel, spiking GNNs with brain-like spiking neurons are drawing increasing research attention owing to the energy efficiency. So far, existing spiking GNNs consider graphs in Euclidean space, ignoring the structural geometry, and suffer from the high latency issue due to Back-Propagation-Through-Time (BPTT) with the surrogate gradient. In light of the aforementioned issues, we are devoted to exploring spiking GNN on Riemannian manifolds, and present a Manifold-valued Spiking GNN (MSG). In particular, we design a new spiking neuron on geodesically complete manifolds with the diffeomorphism, so that BPTT regarding the spikes is replaced by the proposed differentiation via manifold. Theoretically, we show that MSG  approximates a solver of the manifold ordinary differential equation. Extensive experiments on common graphs show the proposed MSG achieves superior performance to previous spiking GNNs and energy efficiency to conventional GNNs."
Poster,Spiking Neural Network as Adaptive Event Stream Slicer,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96133,"Jiahang Cao, Mingyuan Sun, Ziqing Wang, Hao Cheng, Qiang Zhang, shibo zhou, Renjing Xu","Event-based cameras are attracting significant interest as they provide rich edge information, high dynamic range, and high temporal resolution. Many state-of-the-art event-based algorithms rely on splitting the events into fixed groups, resulting in the omission of crucial temporal information, particularly when dealing with diverse motion scenarios (e.g., high/low speed). In this work, we propose SpikeSlicer, a novel-designed event processing framework capable of splitting events stream adaptively. SpikeSlicer utilizes a low-energy spiking neural network (SNN) to trigger event slicing. To guide the SNN to fire spikes at optimal time steps, we propose the Spiking Position-aware Loss (SPA-Loss) to modulate the neuron's state. Additionally, we develop a Feedback-Update training strategy that refines the slicing decisions using feedback from the downstream artificial neural network (ANN). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method yields significant performance improvements in event-based object tracking and recognition. Notably, SpikeSlicer provides a brand-new SNN-ANN cooperation paradigm, where the SNN acts as an efficient, low-energy data processor to assist the ANN in improving downstream performance, injecting new perspectives and potential avenues of exploration."
Poster,Spiking Token Mixer:  An event-driven friendly Former structure for spiking neural networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93999,"Shikuang Deng, Yuhang Wu, KANGRUI DU, Shi Gu","Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by biological processes, use spike signals for inter-layer communication, presenting an energy-efficient alternative to traditional neural networks. To realize the theoretical advantages of SNNs in energy efficiency, it is essential to deploy them onto neuromorphic chips. On clock-driven synchronous chips, employing shorter time steps can enhance energy efficiency but reduce SNN performance. Compared to the clock-driven synchronous chip, the event-driven asynchronous chip achieves much lower energy consumption but only supports some specific network operations. Recently, a series of SNN projects have achieved tremendous success, significantly improving the SNN's performance. However, event-driven asynchronous chips do not support some of the proposed structures, making it impossible to integrate these SNNs into asynchronous hardware. In response to these problems, we propose the Spiking Token Mixer (STMixer) architecture, which consists exclusively of operations supported by asynchronous scenarios, including convolutional, fully connected layers and residual paths. Our series of experiments also demonstrates that STMixer achieves performance on par with spiking transformers in synchronous scenarios with very low timesteps. This indicates its ability to achieve the same level of performance with lower power consumption in synchronous scenarios. The codes are available at \url{https://github.com/brain-intelligence-lab/STMixer_demo}."
Poster,Spiking Transformer with Experts Mixture,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94824,"Zhaokun Zhou, Yijie Lu, Yanhao Jia, Kaiwei Che, Jun Niu, Liwei Huang, Xinyu Shi, Yuesheng Zhu, Guoqi Li, Zhaofei Yu, Li Yuan","Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide a sparse spike-driven mechanism which is believed to be critical for energy-efficient deep learning. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), on the other side, aligns with the brain mechanism of distributed and sparse processing, resulting in an efficient way of enhancing model capacity and conditional computation. In this work, we consider how to incorporate SNNs’ spike-driven and MoE’s conditional computation into a unified framework. However, MoE uses softmax to get the dense conditional weights for each expert and TopK to hard-sparsify the network, which does not fit the properties of SNNs. To address this issue, we reformulate MoE in SNNs and introduce the Spiking Experts Mixture Mechanism (SEMM) from the perspective of sparse spiking activation. Both the experts and the router output spiking sequences, and their element-wise operation makes SEMM computation spike-driven and dynamic sparse-conditional. By developing SEMM into Spiking Transformer, the Experts Mixture Spiking Attention (EMSA) and the Experts Mixture Spiking Perceptron (EMSP) are proposed, which performs routing allocation for head-wise and channel-wise spiking experts, respectively. Experiments show that SEMM realizes sparse conditional computation and obtains a stable improvement on neuromorphic and static datasets with approximate computational overhead based on the Spiking Transformer baselines."
Poster,SPIQA: A Dataset for Multimodal Question Answering on Scientific Papers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97575,"Shraman Pramanick, Rama Chellappa, Subhashini Venugopalan","Seeking answers to questions within long scientific research articles is a crucial area of study that aids readers in quickly addressing their inquiries. However, existing question-answering (QA) datasets based on scientific papers are limited in scale and focus solely on textual content. We introduce SPIQA (Scientific Paper Image Question Answering), the first large-scale QA dataset specifically designed to interpret complex figures and tables within the context of scientific research articles across various domains of computer science. Leveraging the breadth of expertise and ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to understand figures, we employ automatic and manual curation to create the dataset. We craft an information-seeking task on interleaved images and text that involves multiple images covering a wide variety of plots, charts, tables, schematic diagrams, and result visualizations. SPIQA comprises 270K questions divided into training, validation, and three different evaluation splits. Through extensive experiments with 12 prominent foundational models, we evaluate the ability of current multimodal systems to comprehend the nuanced aspects of research articles. Additionally, we propose a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation strategy with in-context retrieval that allows fine-grained, step-by-step assessment and improves model performance. We further explore the upper bounds of performance enhancement with additional textual information, highlighting its promising potential for future research and the dataset’s impact on revolutionizing how we interact with scientific literature."
Poster,Splatter a Video: Video Gaussian Representation  for Versatile Processing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94450,"Yang-Tian Sun, Yihua Huang, Lin Ma, Xiaoyang Lyu, Yan-Pei Cao, Xiaojuan Qi","Video representation is a long-standing problem that is crucial for various downstream tasks, such as tracking, depth prediction, segmentation, view synthesis, and editing. However, current methods either struggle to model complex motions due to the absence of 3D structure or rely on implicit 3D representations that are ill-suited for manipulation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel explicit 3D representation—video Gaussian representation—that embeds a video into 3D Gaussians. Our proposed representation models video appearance in a 3D canonical space using explicit Gaussians as proxies and associates each Gaussian with 3D motions for video motion. This approach offers a more intrinsic and explicit representation than layered atlas or volumetric pixel matrices. To obtain such a representation, we distill 2D priors, such as optical flow and depth, from foundation models to regularize learning in this ill-posed setting.Extensive applications demonstrate the versatility of our new video representation. It has been proven effective in numerous video processing tasks, including tracking, consistent video depth and feature refinement, motion and appearance editing, and stereoscopic video generation."
Poster,"SplitNeRF: Split Sum Approximation Neural Field for Joint Geometry, Illumination, and Material Estimation",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94392,"Jesus Zarzar, Bernard Ghanem","We present a novel approach for digitizing real-world objects by estimating their geometry, material properties, and environmental lighting from a set of posed images with fixed lighting. Our method incorporates into Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) pipelines the split sum approximation used with image-based lighting for real-time physically based rendering. We propose modeling the scene's lighting with a single scene-specific MLP representing pre-integrated image-based lighting at arbitrary resolutions. We accurately model pre-integrated lighting by exploiting a novel regularizer based on efficient Monte Carlo sampling. Additionally, we propose a new method of supervising self-occlusion predictions by exploiting a similar regularizer based on Monte Carlo sampling. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach in estimating scene geometry, material properties, and lighting. Our method attains state-of-the-art relighting quality after only ${\sim}1$ hour of training in a single NVIDIA A100 GPU."
