Poster,Customized Subgraph Selection and Encoding for Drug-drug Interaction Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94377,"Haotong Du, Quanming Yao, Juzheng Zhang, Yang Liu, Zhen Wang","Subgraph-based methods have proven to be effective and interpretable in predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs),which are essential for medical practice and drug development. Subgraph selection and encoding are critical stages in these methods, yet customizing these components remains underexplored due to the high cost of manual adjustments. In this study, inspired by the success of neural architecture search (NAS), we propose a method to search for data-specific components within subgraph-based frameworks. Specifically, we introduce extensive subgraph selection and encoding spaces that account for the diverse contexts of drug interactions in DDI prediction. To address the challenge of large search spaces and high sampling costs, we design a relaxation mechanism that uses an approximation strategy to efficiently explore optimal subgraph configurations. This approach allows for robust exploration of the search space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, with the discovered subgraphs and encoding functions highlighting the model’s adaptability."
Poster,Customizing Language Models with Instance-wise LoRA for Sequential Recommendation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93987,"Xiaoyu Kong, Jiancan Wu, An Zhang, Leheng Sheng, Hui Lin, Xiang Wang, Xiangnan He","Sequential recommendation systems predict the next interaction item based on users' past interactions, aligning recommendations with individual preferences. Leveraging the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge comprehension and reasoning, recent approaches  are eager to apply LLMs to sequential recommendation. A common  paradigm is converting user behavior sequences into instruction data, and fine-tuning the LLM with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA). However, the uniform application of LoRA across diverse user behaviors is insufficient to capture individual variability, resulting in negative transfer between disparate sequences.To address these challenges, we propose Instance-wise LoRA (iLoRA). We innovatively treat the sequential recommendation task as a form of multi-task learning, integrating LoRA with the Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. This approach encourages different experts to capture various aspects of user behavior. Additionally, we introduce a sequence representation guided gate function that generates customized expert participation weights for each user sequence, which allows dynamic parameter adjustment for instance-wise recommendations. In sequential recommendation, iLoRA achieves an average relative improvement of 11.4\% over basic LoRA in the hit ratio metric, with less than a 1\% relative increase in trainable parameters.Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of iLoRA, highlighting its superior performance compared to existing methods in mitigating negative transfer and improving recommendation accuracy.Our data and code are available at https://github.com/AkaliKong/iLoRA."

However, most of the current VQA datasets and models are primarily focused on English and a few major world languages, with images that are Western-centric. While recent efforts have tried to increase the number of languages covered on VQA datasets, they still lack diversity in low-resource languages. More importantly, some datasets extend the text to other languages, either via translation or some other approaches, but usually keep the same images, resulting in narrow cultural representation. To address these limitations, we create CVQA, a new Culturally-diverse Multilingual Visual Question Answering benchmark dataset, designed to cover a rich set of languages and regions, where we engage native speakers and cultural experts in the data collection process. CVQA includes culturally-driven images and questions from across 28 countries in four continents, covering 26 languages with 11 scripts, providing a total of 9k questions. We benchmark several Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on CVQA, and we show that the dataset is challenging for the current state-of-the-art models. This benchmark will serve as a probing evaluation suite for assessing the cultural bias of multimodal models and hopefully encourage more research efforts towards increasing cultural awareness and linguistic diversity in this field."
Poster,CV-VAE: A Compatible Video VAE for Latent Generative Video Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96337,"Sijie Zhao, Yong Zhang, Xiaodong Cun, Shaoshu Yang, Muyao Niu, Xiaoyu Li, Wenbo HU, Ying Shan","Spatio-temporal compression of videos, utilizing networks such as Variational Autoencoders (VAE), plays a crucial role in OpenAI's SORA and numerous other video generative models. For instance, many LLM-like video models learn the distribution of discrete tokens derived from 3D VAEs within the VQVAE framework, while most diffusion-based video models capture the distribution of continuous latent extracted by 2D VAEs without quantization. The temporal compression is simply realized by uniform frame sampling which results in unsmooth motion between consecutive frames. Currently, there lacks of a commonly used continuous video (3D) VAE for latent diffusion-based video models in the research community. Moreover, since current diffusion-based approaches are often implemented using pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models, directly training a video VAE without considering the compatibility with existing T2I models will result in a latent space gap between them, which will take huge computational resources for training to bridge the gap even with the T2I models as initialization. To address this issue, we propose a method for training a video VAE of latent video models, namely CV-VAE, whose latent space is compatible with that of a given image VAE, e.g., image VAE of Stable Diffusion (SD). The compatibility is achieved by the proposed novel latent space regularization, which involves formulating a regularization loss using the image VAE. Benefiting from the latent space compatibility, video models can be trained seamlessly from pre-trained T2I or video models in a truly spatio-temporally compressed latent space, rather than simply sampling video frames at equal intervals. To improve the training efficiency, we also design a novel architecture for the video VAE. With our CV-VAE, existing video models can generate four times more frames with minimal finetuning. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed video VAE."
Poster,CycleNet: Enhancing Time Series Forecasting through Modeling Periodic Patterns,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94391,"Shengsheng Lin, Weiwei Lin, Xinyi HU, Wentai Wu, Ruichao Mo, Haocheng Zhong","The stable periodic patterns present in time series data serve as the foundation for conducting long-horizon forecasts. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of explicitly modeling this periodicity to enhance the performance of models in long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) tasks. Specifically, we introduce the Residual Cycle Forecasting (RCF) technique, which utilizes learnable recurrent cycles to model the inherent periodic patterns within sequences, and then performs predictions on the residual components of the modeled cycles. Combining RCF with a Linear layer or a shallow MLP forms the simple yet powerful method proposed in this paper, called CycleNet. CycleNet achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy in multiple domains including electricity, weather, and energy, while offering significant efficiency advantages by reducing over 90% of the required parameter quantity. Furthermore, as a novel plug-and-play technique, the RCF can also significantly improve the prediction accuracy of existing models, including PatchTST and iTransformer.

Poster,CYCLO: Cyclic Graph Transformer Approach to Multi-Object Relationship Modeling in Aerial Videos,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94619,"Trong-Thuan Nguyen, Pha Nguyen, Xin Li, Jackson Cothren, Alper Yilmaz, Khoa Luu","Video scene graph generation (VidSGG) has emerged as a transformative approach to capturing and interpreting the intricate relationships among objects and their temporal dynamics in video sequences. In this paper, we introduce the new AeroEye dataset that focuses on multi-object relationship modeling in aerial videos. Our AeroEye dataset features various drone scenes and includes a visually comprehensive and precise collection of predicates that capture the intricate relationships and spatial arrangements among objects. To this end, we propose the novel Cyclic Graph Transformer (CYCLO) approach that allows the model to capture both direct and long-range temporal dependencies by continuously updating the history of interactions in a circular manner. The proposed approach also allows one to handle sequences with inherent cyclical patterns and process object relationships in the correct sequential order. Therefore, it can effectively capture periodic and overlapping relationships while minimizing information loss. The extensive experiments on the AeroEye dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CYCLO model, demonstrating its potential to perform scene understanding on drone videos. Finally, the CYCLO method consistently achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) results on two in-the-wild scene graph generation benchmarks, i.e., PVSG and ASPIRe."
Poster,D2R2: Diffusion-based Representation with Random Distance Matching for Tabular Few-shot Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93830,"Ruoxue Liu, Linjiajie Fang, Wenjia Wang, Bingyi Jing","Tabular data is widely utilized in a wide range of real-world applications. The challenge of few-shot learning with tabular data stands as a crucial problem in both industry and academia, due to the high cost or even impossibility of annotating additional samples. However, the inherent heterogeneity of tabular features, combined with the scarcity of labeled data, presents a significant challenge in tabular few-shot classification. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Diffusion-based Representation with Random Distance matching (D2R2) for tabular few-shot learning. D2R2 leverages the powerful expression ability of diffusion models to extract essential semantic knowledge crucial for denoising process. This semantic knowledge proves beneficial in few-shot downstream tasks. During the training process of our designed diffusion model, we introduce a random distance matching to preserve distance information in the embeddings, thereby improving effectiveness for classification. During the classification stage, we introduce an instance-wise iterative prototype scheme to improve performance by accommodating the multimodality of embeddings and increasing clustering robustness. Our experiments reveal the significant efficacy of D2R2 across various tabular few-shot learning benchmarks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in this field."
Poster,DA-Ada: Learning Domain-Aware Adapter for Domain Adaptive Object Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94044,"Haochen Li, Rui Zhang, Hantao Yao, Xin Zhang, Yifan Hao, Xinkai Song, Xiaqing Li, Yongwei Zhao, Yunji Chen, Ling Li","Domain adaptive object detection (DAOD) aims to generalize detectors trained on an annotated source domain to an unlabelled target domain.As the visual-language models (VLMs) can provide essential general knowledge on unseen images, freezing the visual encoder and inserting a domain-agnostic adapter can learn domain-invariant knowledge for DAOD.However, the domain-agnostic adapter is inevitably biased to the source domain.It discards some beneficial knowledge discriminative on the unlabelled domain, \ie domain-specific knowledge of the target domain.To solve the issue, we propose a novel Domain-Aware Adapter (DA-Ada) tailored for the DAOD task.The key point is exploiting domain-specific knowledge between the essential general knowledge and domain-invariant knowledge.DA-Ada consists of the Domain-Invariant Adapter (DIA) for learning domain-invariant knowledge and the Domain-Specific Adapter (DSA) for injecting the domain-specific knowledge from the information discarded by the visual encoder.Comprehensive experiments over multiple DAOD tasks show that DA-Ada can efficiently infer a domain-aware visual encoder for boosting domain adaptive object detection.Our code is available at https://github.com/Therock90421/DA-Ada."
Poster,DACO: Towards Application-Driven and Comprehensive Data Analysis via Code Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97721,"Xueqing Wu, Rui Zheng, Jingzhen Sha, Te-Lin Wu, Hanyu Zhou, Tang Mohan, Kai-Wei Chang, Nanyun Peng, Haoran Huang","Data analysis is a crucial analytical process essential for deriving insights from real-world databases. As shown in Figure 1, the need for data analysis typically arises from specific application scenarios, and requires diverse reasoning skills including mathematical reasoning, logical reasoning, and strategic reasoning. Existing work often focus on simple factual retrieval or arithmetic resolutions and thus are insufficient for addressing complex real-world queries. This work aims to propose new resources and benchmarks on this crucial yet challenging and under-explored task. Due to the prohibitively high cost of collecting expert annotations, we use large language models (LLMs) enhanced by code generation to automatically generate high-quality data analysis, which will later be refined by human annotators. We construct the **DACO dataset**, containing (1) 440 databases (of tabular data) collected from real-world scenarios, (2) ~2k automatically generated query-answer pairs that can serve as weak supervision for model training, and (3) a concentrated but high-quality test set with human refined annotations that serves as our main evaluation benchmark. Experiments show that while LLMs like GPT-4 exhibit promising data analysis capabilities, they are still evaluated as less helpful than human-written analysis on 58.1% cases. Leveraging our weak supervision data, we experiment with various fine-tuning methods, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Our trained model outperforms existing baselines for table question answering, and RLHF further boosts the helpfulness of generated analysis on 58.5% cases.Data and code are released at https://github.com/shirley-wu/daco."
Poster,DAGER: Exact Gradient Inversion for Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96118,"Ivo Petrov, Dimitar I. Dimitrov, Maximilian Baader, Mark Müller, Martin Vechev","Federated learning works by aggregating locally computed gradients from multiple clients, thus enabling collaborative training without sharing private client data. However, prior work has shown that the data can actually be recovered by the server using so-called gradient inversion attacks. While these attacks perform well when applied on images, they are limited in the text domain and only permit approximate reconstruction of small batches and short input sequences. In this work, we propose DAGER, the first algorithm to recover whole batches of input text exactly. DAGER leverages the low-rank structure of self-attention layer gradients and the discrete nature of token embeddings to efficiently check if a given token sequence is part of the client data. We use this check to exactly recover full batches in the honest-but-curious setting without any prior on the data for both encoder and decoder-based architectures using exhaustive heuristic search and a greedy approach, respectively. We provide an efficient GPU implementation of DAGER and show experimentally that it recovers full batches of size up to 128 on large language models (LLMs), beating prior attacks in speed (20x at same batch size), scalability (10x larger batches), and reconstruction quality (ROUGE-1/2 > 0.99)."
