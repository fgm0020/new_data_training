Poster,Learning Cooperative Trajectory Representations for Motion Forecasting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93746,"Hongzhi Ruan, Haibao Yu, Wenxian Yang, Siqi Fan, Zaiqing Nie","Motion forecasting is an essential task for autonomous driving, and utilizing information from infrastructure and other vehicles can enhance forecasting capabilities.Existing research mainly focuses on leveraging single-frame cooperative information to enhance the limited perception capability of the ego vehicle, while underutilizing the motion and interaction context of traffic participants observed from cooperative devices. In this paper, we propose a forecasting-oriented representation paradigm to utilize motion and interaction features from cooperative information. Specifically, we present V2X-Graph, a representative framework to achieve interpretable and end-to-end trajectory feature fusion for cooperative motion forecasting. V2X-Graph is evaluated on V2X-Seq in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios.To further evaluate on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) scenario, we construct the first real-world V2X motion forecasting dataset V2X-Traj, which contains multiple autonomous vehicles and infrastructure in every scenario.Experimental results on both V2X-Seq and V2X-Traj show the advantage of our method. We hope both V2X-Graph and V2X-Traj will benefit the further development of cooperative motion forecasting.Find the project at https://github.com/AIR-THU/V2X-Graph."
Poster,Learning Cortico-Muscular Dependence through Orthonormal Decomposition of Density Ratios,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93138,"Shihan Ma, Bo Hu, Tianyu Jia, Alexander Clarke, Blanka Zicher, Arnault Caillet, Dario Farina, Jose C Principe","The cortico-spinal neural pathway is fundamental for motor control and movement execution, and in humans it is typically studied using concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) recordings. However, current approaches for capturing high-level and contextual connectivity between these recordings have important limitations. Here, we present a novel application of statistical dependence estimators based on orthonormal decomposition of density ratios to model the relationship between cortical and muscle oscillations. Our method extends from traditional scalar-valued measures by learning eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and projection spaces of density ratios from realizations of the signal, addressing the interpretability, scalability, and local temporal dependence of cortico-muscular connectivity. We experimentally demonstrate that eigenfunctions learned from cortico-muscular connectivity can accurately classify movements and subjects. Moreover, they reveal channel and temporal dependencies that confirm the activation of specific EEG channels during movement."
Poster,Learning Cut Generating Functions for Integer Programming,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96352,"Hongyu Cheng, Amitabh Basu","The branch-and-cut algorithm is the method of choice to solve large scale integer programming problems in practice. A key ingredient of branch-and-cut is the use of *cutting planes* which are derived constraints that reduce the search space for an optimal solution. Selecting effective cutting planes to produce small branch-and-cut trees is a critical challenge in the branch-and-cut algorithm. Recent advances have employed a data-driven approach to select good cutting planes from a parameterized family, aimed at reducing the branch-and-bound tree size (in expectation) for a given distribution of integer programming instances. We extend this idea to the selection of the best cut generating function (CGF), which is a tool in the integer programming literature for generating a wide variety of cutting planes that generalize the well-known Gomory Mixed-Integer (GMI) cutting planes. We provide rigorous sample complexity bounds for the selection of an effective CGF from certain parameterized families that provably performs well for any specified distribution on the problem instances. Our empirical results show that the selected CGF can outperform the GMI cuts for certain distributions. Additionally, we explore the sample complexity of using neural networks for instance-dependent CGF selection."
Poster,Learning De-Biased Representations for Remote-Sensing Imagery,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93721,"Zichen Tian, Zhaozheng CHEN, QIANRU SUN","Remote sensing (RS) imagery, which requires specialized satellites to collect and is difficult to annotate, suffers from data scarcity and class imbalance in certain spectrums. Due to their data scarcity, training large-scale RS models from scratch is unrealistic, and the alternative is to transfer pre-trained models by fine-tuning or a more data-efficient method LoRA. Due to class imbalance, transferred models exhibit strong bias, where features of the major class dominate over those of the minor class. In this paper, we propose debLoRA, a generic training approach that works with any LoRA variants to yield debiased features. It is an unsupervised learning approach that can diversify minor class features based on the shared attributes with major classes, where the attributes are obtained by a simple step of clustering. To evaluate it, we conduct extensive experiments in two transfer learning scenarios in the RS domain: from natural to optical RS images, and from optical RS to multi-spectrum RS images. We perform object classification and oriented object detection tasks on the optical RS dataset DOTA and the SAR dataset FUSRS. Results show that our debLoRA consistently surpasses prior arts across these RS adaptation settings, yielding up to 3.3 and 4.7 percentage points gains on the tail classes for natural $\to$ optical RS and optical RS $\to$ multi-spectrum RS adaptations, respectively, while preserving the performance on head classes, substantiating its efficacy and adaptability"
Poster,Learning diffusion at lightspeed,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93047,"Antonio Terpin, Nicolas Lanzetti, Martín Gadea, Florian Dorfler","Diffusion regulates numerous natural processes and the dynamics of many successful generative models. Existing models to learn the diffusion terms from observational data rely on complex bilevel optimization problems and model only the drift of the system.We propose a new simple model, JKOnet*, which bypasses the complexity of existing architectures while presenting significantly enhanced representational capabilities: JKOnet* recovers the potential, interaction, and internal energy components of the underlying diffusion process. JKOnet* minimizes a simple quadratic loss and outperforms other baselines in terms of sample efficiency, computational complexity, and accuracy. Additionally, JKOnet* provides a closed-form optimal solution for linearly parametrized functionals, and, when applied to predict the evolution of cellular processes from real-world data, it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost of all existing methods.Our methodology is based on the interpretation of diffusion processes as energy-minimizing trajectories in the probability space via the so-called JKO scheme, which we study via its first-order optimality conditions."
Poster,Learning Diffusion Priors from Observations by Expectation Maximization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96409,"François Rozet, Gerome Andry, Francois Lanusse, Gilles Louppe","Diffusion models recently proved to be remarkable priors for Bayesian inverse problems. However, training these models typically requires access to large amounts of clean data, which could prove difficult in some settings. In this work, we present a novel method based on the expectation-maximization algorithm for training diffusion models from incomplete and noisy observations only. Unlike previous works, our method leads to proper diffusion models, which is crucial for downstream tasks. As part of our method, we propose and motivate an improved posterior sampling scheme for unconditional diffusion models. We present empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our method."
Poster,Learning Discrete Concepts in Latent Hierarchical Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94487,"Lingjing Kong, Guangyi Chen, Biwei Huang, Eric Xing, Yuejie Chi, Kun Zhang","Learning concepts from natural high-dimensional data (e.g., images) holds potential in building human-aligned and interpretable machine learning models.    Despite its encouraging prospect, formalization and theoretical insights into this crucial task are still lacking.    In this work, we formalize concepts as discrete latent causal variables that are related via a hierarchical causal model that encodes different abstraction levels of concepts embedded in high-dimensional data (e.g., a dog breed and its eye shapes in natural images).    We formulate conditions to facilitate the identification of the proposed causal model, which reveals when learning such concepts from unsupervised data is possible.    Our conditions permit complex causal hierarchical structures beyond latent trees and multi-level directed acyclic graphs in prior work and can handle high-dimensional, continuous observed variables, which is well-suited for unstructured data modalities such as images.    We substantiate our theoretical claims with synthetic data experiments.    Further, we discuss our theory's implications for understanding the underlying mechanisms of latent diffusion models and provide corresponding empirical evidence for our theoretical insights."
Poster,Learning Discrete Latent Variable Structures with Tensor Rank Conditions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96540,"Zhengming Chen, Ruichu Cai, Feng Xie, Jie Qiao, Anpeng Wu, Zijian Li, Zhifeng Hao, Kun Zhang","Unobserved discrete data are ubiquitous in many scientific disciplines, and how to learn the causal structure of these latent variables is crucial for uncovering data patterns. Most studies focus on the linear latent variable model or impose strict constraints on latent structures, which fail to address cases in discrete data involving non-linear relationships or complex latent structures. To achieve this, we explore a tensor rank condition on contingency tables for an observed variable set $\mathbf{X}_p$, showing that the rank is determined by the minimum support of a specific conditional set (not necessary in $\mathbf{X}_p$) that d-separates all variables in $\mathbf{X}_p$. By this, one can locate the latent variable through probing the rank on different observed variables set, and further identify the latent causal structure under some structure assumptions. We present the corresponding identification algorithm and conduct simulated experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method. In general, our results elegantly extend the identification boundary for causal discovery with discrete latent variables and expand the application scope of causal discovery with latent variables."
Poster,Learning Disentangled Representations for Perceptual Point Cloud Quality Assessment via Mutual Information Minimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95520,"Ziyu Shan, Yujie Zhang, Yipeng Liu, YILING XU","No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA) aims to objectively assess the human perceptual quality of point clouds without relying on pristine-quality point clouds for reference. It is becoming increasingly significant with the rapid advancement of immersive media applications such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). However, current NR-PCQA models attempt to indiscriminately learn point cloud content and distortion representations within a single network, overlooking their distinct contributions to quality information. To address this issue, we propose DisPA, a novel disentangled representation learning framework for NR-PCQA. The framework trains a dual-branch disentanglement network to minimize mutual information (MI) between representations of point cloud content and distortion. Specifically, to fully disentangle representations, the two branches adopt different philosophies: the content-aware encoder is pretrained by a masked auto-encoding strategy, which can allow the encoder to capture semantic information from rendered images of distorted point clouds; the distortion-aware encoder takes a mini-patch map as input, which forces the encoder to focus on low-level distortion patterns. Furthermore, we utilize an MI estimator to estimate the tight upper bound of the actual MI and further minimize it to achieve explicit representation disentanglement. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DisPA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple PCQA datasets."
Poster,Learning Distinguishable Trajectory Representation with Contrastive Loss,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96102,"Tianxu Li, Kun Zhu, Juan Li, Yang Zhang","Policy network parameter sharing is a commonly used technique in advanced deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms to improve learning efficiency by reducing the number of policy parameters and sharing experiences among agents. Nevertheless, agents that share the policy parameters tend to learn similar behaviors. To encourage multi-agent diversity, prior works typically maximize the mutual information between trajectories and agent identities using variational inference. However, this category of methods easily leads to inefficient exploration due to limited trajectory visitations. To resolve this limitation, inspired by the learning of pre-trained models, in this paper, we propose a novel Contrastive Trajectory Representation (CTR) method based on learning distinguishable trajectory representations to encourage multi-agent diversity. Specifically, CTR maps the trajectory of an agent into a latent trajectory representation space by an encoder and an autoregressive model. To achieve the distinguishability among trajectory representations of different agents, we introduce contrastive learning to maximize the mutual information between the trajectory representations and learnable identity representations of different agents. We implement CTR on top of QMIX and evaluate its performance in various cooperative multi-agent tasks. The empirical results demonstrate that our proposed CTR yields significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art methods."
