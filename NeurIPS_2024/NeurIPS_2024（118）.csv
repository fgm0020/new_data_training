Poster,DreamMesh4D: Video-to-4D Generation with Sparse-Controlled Gaussian-Mesh Hybrid Representation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96515,"Zhiqi Li, Yiming Chen, Peidong Liu","Recent advancements in 2D/3D generative techniques have facilitated the generation of dynamic 3D objects from monocular videos. Previous methods mainly rely on the implicit neural radiance fields (NeRF) or explicit Gaussian Splatting as the underlying representation, and struggle to achieve satisfactory spatial-temporal consistency and surface appearance. Drawing inspiration from modern 3D animation pipelines, we introduce DreamMesh4D, a novel framework combining mesh representation with geometric skinning technique to generate high-quality 4D object from a monocular video. Instead of utilizing classical texture map for appearance, we bind Gaussian splats to triangle face of mesh for differentiable optimization of both the texture and mesh vertices. In particular, DreamMesh4D begins with a coarse mesh obtained through an image-to-3D generation procedure. Sparse points are then uniformly sampled across the mesh surface, and are used to build a deformation graph to drive the motion of the 3D object for the sake of computational efficiency and providing additional constraint. For each step, transformations of sparse control points are predicted using a deformation network, and the mesh vertices as well as the surface Gaussians are deformed via a novel geometric skinning algorithm. The skinning algorithm is a hybrid approach combining LBS (linear blending skinning) and DQS (dual-quaternion skinning), mitigating drawbacks associated with both approaches. The static surface Gaussians and mesh vertices as well as the dynamic deformation network are learned via reference view photometric loss, score distillation loss as well as other regularization losses in a two-stage manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of our method in terms of both rendering quality and spatial-temporal consistency. Furthermore, our method is compatible with modern graphic pipelines, showcasing its potential in the 3D gaming and film industry."
Poster,DreamScene4D: Dynamic Multi-Object Scene Generation from Monocular Videos,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94673,"Wen-Hsuan Chu, Lei Ke, Katerina Fragkiadaki","View-predictive generative models provide strong priors for lifting object-centric images and videos into 3D and 4D through rendering and score distillation objectives. A question then remains: what about lifting complete multi-object dynamic scenes? There are two challenges in this direction: First, rendering error gradients are often insufficient to recover fast object motion, and second,  view predictive generative models work much better for objects than whole scenes, so, score distillation objectives cannot currently be applied at the scene level directly. We present DreamScene4D, the first approach to generate 3D dynamic scenes of multiple objects from monocular videos via 360-degree novel view synthesis. Our key insight is a ""decompose-recompose"" approach that factorizes the video scene into the background and object tracks, while also factorizing object motion into 3 components: object-centric deformation, object-to-world-frame transformation, and camera motion. Such decomposition permits rendering error gradients and object view-predictive models to recover object 3D completions and deformations while bounding box tracks guide the large object movements in the scene. We show extensive results on challenging DAVIS, Kubric, and self-captured videos with quantitative comparisons and a user preference study. Besides 4D scene generation, DreamScene4D obtains accurate 2D persistent point track by projecting the inferred 3D trajectories to 2D. We will release our code and hope our work will stimulate more research on fine-grained 4D understanding from videos."
Poster,DreamSteerer: Enhancing Source Image Conditioned Editability using Personalized Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94953,"Zhengyang Yu, Zhaoyuan Yang, Jing Zhang","Recent text-to-image (T2I) personalization methods have shown great premise in teaching a diffusion model user-specified concepts given a few images for reusing the acquired concepts in a novel context. With massive efforts being dedicated to personalized generation, a promising extension is personalized editing, namely to edit an image using personalized concepts, which can provide more precise guidance signal than traditional textual guidance. To address this, one straightforward solution is to incorporate a personalized diffusion model with a text-driven editing framework. However, such solution often shows unsatisfactory editability on the source image. To address this, we propose DreamSteerer, a plug-in method for augmenting existing T2I personalization methods. Specifically, we enhance the source image conditioned editability of a personalized diffusion model via a novel Editability Driven Score Distillation (EDSD) objective. Moreover, we identify a mode trapping issue with EDSD, and propose a mode shifting regularization with spatial feature guided sampling to avoid such issue. We further employ two key modifications on the Delta Denoising Score framework that enable high-fidelity local editing with personalized concepts. Extensive experiments validate that DreamSteerer can significantly improve the editability of several T2I personalization baselines while being computationally efficient."
Poster,Drift-Resilient TabPFN: In-Context Learning Temporal Distribution Shifts on Tabular Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93581,"Kai Helli, David Schnurr, Noah Hollmann, Samuel Müller, Frank Hutter","While most ML models expect independent and identically distributed data, this assumption is often violated in real-world scenarios due to distribution shifts, resulting in the degradation of machine learning model performance. Until now, no tabular method has consistently outperformed classical supervised learning, which ignores these shifts. To address temporal distribution shifts, we present Drift-Resilient TabPFN, a fresh approach based on In-Context Learning with a Prior-Data Fitted Network that learns the learning algorithm itself: it accepts the entire training dataset as input and makes predictions on the test set in a single forward pass. Specifically, it learns to approximate Bayesian inference on synthetic datasets drawn from a prior that specifies the model's inductive bias. This prior is based on structural causal models (SCM), which gradually shift over time. To model shifts of these causal models, we use a secondary SCM, that specifies changes in the primary model parameters. The resulting Drift-Resilient TabPFN can be applied to unseen data, runs in seconds on small to moderately sized datasets and needs no hyperparameter tuning. Comprehensive evaluations across 18 synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate large performance improvements over a wide range of baselines, such as XGB, CatBoost, TabPFN, and applicable methods featured in the Wild-Time benchmark. Compared to the strongest baselines, it improves accuracy from 0.688 to 0.744 and ROC AUC from 0.786 to 0.832 while maintaining stronger calibration. This approach could serve as significant groundwork for further research on out-of-distribution prediction."
Poster,DRIP: Unleashing Diffusion Priors for Joint Foreground and Alpha Prediction in Image Matting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93926,"Xiaodi Li, Zongxin Yang, Ruijie Quan, Yi Yang","Recovering the foreground color and opacity/alpha matte from a single image (i.e., image matting) is a challenging and ill-posed problem where data priors play a critical role in achieving precise results. Traditional methods generally predict the alpha matte and then extract the foreground through post-processing, often failing to produce high-fidelity foreground color. This failure stems from the models' difficulty in learning robust color predictions from limited matting datasets. To address this, we explore the potential of leveraging vision priors embedded in pre-trained latent diffusion models (LDM) for estimating foreground RGBA values in challenging scenarios and rare objects. We introduce Drip, a novel approach for image matting that harnesses the rich prior knowledge of LDM models. Our method incorporates a switcher and a cross-domain attention mechanism to extend the original LDM for joint prediction of the foreground color and opacity. This setup facilitates mutual information exchange and ensures high consistency across both modalities. To mitigate the inherent reconstruction errors of the LDM's VAE decoder, we propose a latent transparency decoder to align the RGBA prediction with the input image, thereby reducing discrepancies. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in foreground and alpha predictions and shows remarkable generalizability across various benchmarks."

Poster,Drones Help Drones: A Collaborative Framework for Multi-Drone Object Trajectory Prediction and Beyond,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96836,"Zhechao Wang, Peirui Cheng, Minxing Chen, Pengju Tian, Zhirui Wang, Xinming Li, Xue Yang, Xian Sun","Collaborative trajectory prediction can comprehensively forecast the future motion of objects through multi-view complementary information. However, it encounters two main challenges in multi-drone collaboration settings. The expansive aerial observations make it difficult to generate precise Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations. Besides, excessive interactions can not meet real-time prediction requirements within the constrained drone-based communication bandwidth. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework named ""Drones Help Drones"" (DHD). Firstly, we incorporate the ground priors provided by the drone's inclined observation to estimate the distance between objects and drones, leading to more precise BEV generation. Secondly, we design a selective mechanism based on the local feature discrepancy to prioritize the critical information contributing to prediction tasks during inter-drone interactions. Additionally, we create the first dataset for multi-drone collaborative prediction, named ""Air-Co-Pred"", and conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments to validate the effectiveness of our DHD framework. The results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, DHD reduces position deviation in BEV representations by over 20\% and requires only a quarter of the transmission ratio for interactions while achieving comparable prediction performance. Moreover, DHD also shows promising generalization to the collaborative 3D object detection in CoPerception-UAVs."
Poster,DropBP: Accelerating Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models by Dropping Backward Propagation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93106,"Sunghyeon Woo, Baeseong Park, Byeongwook Kim, Minjung Jo, Se Jung Kwon, Dongsuk Jeon, Dongsoo Lee","Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success across various domains. However, training these LLMs typically involves substantial memory and computational costs during both forward and backward propagation. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) considerably reduces the training memory associated with parameters, it does not address the significant computational costs and activation memory. In this paper, we propose Dropping Backward Propagation (DropBP), a novel approach designed to reduce computational costs and activation memory while maintaining accuracy. DropBP randomly drops layers during backward propagation, which is essentially equivalent to training shallow submodules generated by undropped layers and residual connections. Additionally, DropBP calculates the sensitivity of each layer to assign an appropriate drop rate, thereby stabilizing the training process. DropBP is not only applicable to full fine-tuning but can also be orthogonally integrated with all types of PEFT by dropping layers during backward propagation. Specifically, DropBP can reduce training time by 44% with comparable accuracy to the baseline, accelerate convergence to the same perplexity by 1.5$\times$, and enable training with a sequence length 6.2$\times$ larger on a single NVIDIA-A100 GPU. Furthermore, our DropBP enabled a throughput increase of 79% on a NVIDIA A100 GPU and 117% on an Intel Gaudi2 HPU.

Poster,DropEdge not Foolproof: Effective Augmentation Method for Signed Graph Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96157,"ZEYU ZHANG, Lu Li, Shuyan Wan, Wang, Zhiyi Wang, Zhiyuan Lu, Dong Hao, Wanli Li","Signed graphs can model friendly or antagonistic relations where edges are annotated with a positive or negative sign. The main downstream task in signed graph analysis is $\textit{link sign prediction}$. Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) have been widely used for signed graph representation learning. While significant progress has been made in SGNNs research, two issues (i.e., graph sparsity and unbalanced triangles) persist in the current SGNN models. We aim to alleviate these issues through data augmentation ($\textit{DA}$) techniques which have demonstrated effectiveness in improving the performance of graph neural networks. However, most graph augmentation methods are primarily aimed at graph-level and node-level tasks (e.g., graph classification and node classification) and cannot be directly applied to signed graphs due to the lack of side information (e.g., node features and label information) in available real-world signed graph datasets. Random $\textit{DropEdge} $is one of the few $\textit{DA}$ methods that can be directly used for signed graph data augmentation, but its effectiveness is still unknown. In this paper, we first provide the generalization bound for the SGNN model and demonstrate from both experimental and theoretical perspectives that the random $\textit{DropEdge}$ cannot improve the performance of link sign prediction. Therefore, we propose a novel signed graph augmentation method, $\underline{S}$igned $\underline{G}$raph $\underline{A}$ugmentation framework (SGA). Specifically, SGA first integrates a structure augmentation module to detect candidate edges solely based on network information. Furthermore, SGA incorporates a novel strategy to select beneficial candidates. Finally, SGA introduces a novel data augmentation perspective to enhance the training process of SGNNs. Experiment results on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SGA effectively boosts the performance of diverse SGNN models, achieving improvements of up to 32.3\% in F1-micro for SGCN on the Slashdot dataset in the link sign prediction task."
