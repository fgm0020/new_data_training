Poster,Bias in Motion: Theoretical Insights into the Dynamics of Bias in SGD Training,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95235,"Anchit Jain, Rozhin Nobahari, Aristide Baratin, Stefano Sarao Mannelli","Machine learning systems often acquire biases by leveraging undesired features in the data, impacting accuracy variably across different sub-populations of the data. However, our current understanding of bias formation mostly focuses on the initial and final stages of learning, leaving a gap in knowledge regarding the transient dynamics. To address this gap, this paper explores the evolution of bias in a teacher-student setup that models different data sub-populations with a Gaussian-mixture model. We provide an analytical description of the stochastic gradient descent dynamics of a linear classifier in this setup, which we prove to be exact in high dimension.Notably, our analysis identifies different properties of the sub-populations that drive bias at different timescales and hence shows a shifting preference of our classifier during training. By applying our general solution to fairness and robustness, we delineate how and when heterogeneous data and spurious features can generate and amplify bias. We empirically validate our results in more complex scenarios by training deeper networks on synthetic and real data, i.e. using CIFAR10, MNIST, and CelebA datasets."
Poster,Bidirectional Recurrence for Cardiac Motion Tracking with Gaussian Process Latent Coding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96144,"Jiewen Yang, Yiqun Lin, Bin Pu, Xiaomeng Li","Quantitative analysis of cardiac motion is crucial for assessing cardiac function. This analysis typically uses imaging modalities such as MRI and Echocardiograms that capture detailed image sequences throughout the heartbeat cycle. Previous methods predominantly focused on the analysis of image pairs lacking consideration of the motion dynamics and spatial variability. Consequently, these methods often overlook the long-term relationships and regional motion characteristic of cardiac. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the GPTrack, a novel unsupervised framework crafted to fully explore the temporal and spatial dynamics of cardiac motion. The GPTrack enhances motion tracking by employing the sequential Gaussian Process in the latent space and encoding statistics by spatial information at each time stamp, which robustly promotes temporal consistency and spatial variability of cardiac dynamics. Also, we innovatively aggregate sequential information in a bidirectional recursive manner, mimicking the behavior of diffeomorphic registration to better capture consistent long-term relationships of motions across cardiac regions such as the ventricles and atria. Our GPTrack significantly improves the precision of motion tracking in both 3D and 4D medical images while maintaining computational efficiency. The code is available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/GPTrack."
Poster,BiDM: Pushing the Limit of Quantization for Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93620,"Xingyu Zheng, Xianglong Liu, Yichen Bian, Xudong Ma, Yulun Zhang, Jiakai Wang, Jinyang Guo, Haotong Qin","Diffusion models (DMs) have been significantly developed and widely used in various applications due to their excellent generative qualities. However, the expensive computation and massive parameters of DMs hinder their practical use in resource-constrained scenarios. As one of the effective compression approaches, quantization allows DMs to achieve storage saving and inference acceleration by reducing bit-width while maintaining generation performance.  However, as the most extreme quantization form, 1-bit binarization causes the generation performance of DMs to face severe degradation or even collapse. This paper proposes a novel method, namely BiDM, for fully binarizing weights and activations of DMs, pushing quantization to the 1-bit limit. From a temporal perspective, we introduce the Timestep-friendly Binary Structure (TBS), which uses learnable activation binarizers and cross-timestep feature connections to address the highly timestep-correlated activation features of DMs. From a spatial perspective, we propose Space Patched Distillation (SPD) to address the difficulty of matching binary features during distillation, focusing on the spatial locality of image generation tasks and noise estimation networks. As the first work to fully binarize DMs, the W1A1 BiDM on the LDM-4 model for LSUN-Bedrooms 256$\times$256 achieves a remarkable FID of 22.74, significantly outperforming the current state-of-the-art general binarization methods with an FID of 59.44 and invalid generative samples, and achieves up to excellent 28.0 times storage and 52.7 times OPs savings."
Poster,"Bigger, Regularized, Optimistic: scaling for compute and sample efficient continuous control",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94179,"Michal Nauman, Mateusz Ostaszewski, Krzysztof Jankowski, Piotr Miłoś, Marek Cygan","Sample efficiency in Reinforcement Learning (RL) has traditionally been driven by algorithmic enhancements. In this work, we demonstrate that scaling can also lead to substantial improvements.  We conduct a thorough investigation into the interplay of scaling model capacity and domain-specific RL enhancements. These empirical findings inform the design choices underlying our proposed BRO (Bigger, Regularized, Optimistic) algorithm. The key innovation behind BRO is that strong regularization allows for effective scaling of the critic networks, which, paired with optimistic exploration, leads to superior performance. BRO achieves state-of-the-art results, significantly outperforming the leading model-based and model-free algorithms across 40 complex tasks from the DeepMind Control, MetaWorld, and MyoSuite benchmarks. BRO is the first model-free algorithm to achieve near-optimal policies in the notoriously challenging Dog and Humanoid tasks."
Poster,BIGOS V2 Benchmark for Polish ASR: Curated Datasets and Tools for Reproducible Evaluation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97720,Michał Junczyk,"Speech datasets available in the public domain are often underutilized because of challenges in accessibility and interoperability. To address this, a system to survey, catalog, and curate existing speech datasets was developed, enabling reproducible evaluation of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. The system was applied to curate over 24 datasets and evaluate 25 ASR models, with a specific focus on Polish. This research represents the most extensive comparison to date of commercial and free ASR systems for the Polish language, drawing insights from 600 system-model-test set evaluations across 8 analysis scenarios. Curated datasets and benchmark results are available publicly. The evaluation tools are open-sourced to support reproducibility of the benchmark, encourage community-driven improvements, and facilitate adaptation for other languages."
Poster,Bileve: Securing Text Provenance in Large Language Models Against Spoofing with Bi-level Signature,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93192,"Tong Zhou, Xuandong Zhao, Xiaolin Xu, Shaolei Ren","Text watermarks for large language models (LLMs) have been commonly used to identify the origins of machine-generated content, which is promising for assessing liability when combating deepfake or harmful content. While existing watermarking techniques typically prioritize robustness against removal attacks, unfortunately, they are vulnerable to spoofing attacks: malicious actors can subtly alter the meanings of LLM-generated responses or even forge harmful content, potentially misattributing blame to the LLM developer. To overcome this, we introduce a bi-level signature scheme, Bileve, which embeds fine-grained signature bits for integrity checks (mitigating spoofing attacks) as well as a coarse-grained signal to trace text sources when the signature is invalid (enhancing detectability) via a novel rank-based sampling strategy. Compared to conventional watermark detectors that only output binary results, Bileve can differentiate 5 scenarios during detection, reliably tracing text provenance and regulating LLMs. The experiments conducted on OPT-1.3B and LLaMA-7B demonstrate the effectiveness of Bileve in defeating spoofing attacks with enhanced detectability."
Poster,Binarized Diffusion Model for Image Super-Resolution,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93008,"Zheng Chen, Haotong Qin, Yong Guo, Xiongfei Su, Xin Yuan, Linghe Kong, Yulun Zhang","Advanced diffusion models (DMs) perform impressively in image super-resolution (SR), but the high memory and computational costs hinder their deployment. Binarization, an ultra-compression algorithm, offers the potential for effectively accelerating DMs. Nonetheless, due to the model structure and the multi-step iterative attribute of DMs, existing binarization methods result in significant performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce a novel binarized diffusion model, BI-DiffSR, for image SR. First, for the model structure, we design a UNet architecture optimized for binarization. We propose the consistent-pixel-downsample (CP-Down) and consistent-pixel-upsample (CP-Up) to maintain dimension consistent and facilitate the full-precision information transfer. Meanwhile, we design the channel-shuffle-fusion (CS-Fusion) to enhance feature fusion in skip connection. Second, for the activation difference across timestep, we design the timestep-aware redistribution (TaR) and activation function (TaA). The TaR and TaA dynamically adjust the distribution of activations based on different timesteps, improving the flexibility and representation alability of the binarized module. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our BI-DiffSR outperforms existing binarization methods. Code is released at: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/BI-DiffSR."
Poster,Binary Search with Distributional Predictions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95727,"Michael Dinitz, Sungjin Im, Thomas Lavastida, Ben Moseley, Aidin Niaparast, Sergei Vassilvitskii","Algorithms with (machine-learned) predictions is a powerful framework for combining traditional worst-case algorithms with modern machine learning.  However, the vast majority of work in this space assumes that the prediction itself is non-probabilistic, even if it is generated by some stochastic process (such as a machine learning system).  This is a poor fit for modern ML, particularly modern neural networks, which naturally generate a *distribution*.  We initiate the study of algorithms with *distributional* predictions, where the prediction itself is a distribution.  We focus on one of the simplest yet fundamental settings: binary search (or searching a sorted array).   This setting has one of the simplest algorithms with a point prediction, but what happens if the prediction is a distribution?  We show that this is a richer setting: there are simple distributions where using the classical prediction-based algorithm with any single prediction does poorly.   Motivated by this, as our main result, we give an algorithm with query complexity $O(H(p) + \log \eta)$, where $H(p)$ is the entropy of the true distribution $p$ and $\eta$ is the earth mover's distance between $p$ and the predicted distribution $\hat p$.  This also yields the first *distributionally-robust* algorithm for the classical problem of computing an optimal binary search tree given a distribution over target keys. We complement this with a lower bound showing that this query complexity is essentially optimal (up to constants), and experiments validating the practical usefulness of our algorithm."
Poster,Binding in hippocampal-entorhinal circuits enables compositionality in cognitive maps,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95714,"Christopher Kymn, Sonia Mazelet, Anthony Thomas, Denis Kleyko, Edward Frady, Fritz Sommer, Bruno Olshausen","We propose a normative model for spatial representation in the hippocampal formation that combines optimality principles, such as maximizing coding range and spatial information per neuron, with an algebraic framework for computing in distributed representation. Spatial position is encoded in a residue number system, with individual residues represented by high-dimensional, complex-valued vectors. These are composed into a single vector representing position by a similarity-preserving, conjunctive vector-binding operation. Self-consistency between the vectors representing position and the individual residues is enforced by a modular attractor network whose modules correspond to the grid cell modules in entorhinal cortex. The vector binding operation can also be used to bind different contexts to spatial representations, yielding a model for entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. We provide model analysis of scaling, similarity preservation and convergence behavior as well as experiments demonstrating noise robustness, sub-integer resolution in representing position, and path integration. The model formalizes the computations in the cognitive map and makes testable experimental predictions."
Poster,Binocular-Guided 3D Gaussian Splatting with View Consistency for Sparse View Synthesis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93625,"Liang Han, Junsheng Zhou, Yu-Shen Liu, Zhizhong Han","Novel view synthesis from sparse inputs is a vital yet challenging task in 3D computer vision. Previous methods explore 3D Gaussian Splatting with neural priors (e.g. depth priors) as an additional supervision, demonstrating promising quality and efficiency compared to the NeRF based methods. However, the neural priors from 2D pretrained models are often noisy and blurry, which struggle to precisely guide the learning of radiance fields. In this paper, We propose a novel method for synthesizing novel views from sparse views with Gaussian Splatting that does not require external prior as supervision. Our key idea lies in exploring the self-supervisions inherent in the binocular stereo consistency between each pair of binocular images constructed with disparity-guided image warping. To this end, we additionally introduce a Gaussian opacity constraint which regularizes the Gaussian locations and avoids Gaussian redundancy forimproving the robustness and efficiency of inferring 3D Gaussians from sparse views. Extensive experiments on the LLFF, DTU, and Blender datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods."
