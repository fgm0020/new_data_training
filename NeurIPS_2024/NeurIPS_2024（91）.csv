Poster,DALD: Improving Logits-based Detector without Logits from Black-box LLMs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94084,"Cong Zeng, Shengkun Tang, Xianjun Yang, Yuanzhou Chen, Yiyou Sun, Zhiqiang Xu, Yao Li, Haifeng Chen, Wei Cheng, Dongkuan (DK) Xu","The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized text generation, producing outputs that closely mimic human writing. This blurring of lines between machine- and human-written text presents new challenges in distinguishing one from the other – a task further complicated by the frequent updates and closed nature of leading proprietary LLMs. Traditional logits-based detection methods leverage surrogate models for identifying LLM-generated content when the exact logits are unavailable from black-box LLMs. However, these methods grapple with the misalignment between the distributions of the surrogate and the often undisclosed target models, leading to performance degradation, particularly with the introduction of new, closed-source models. Furthermore, while current methodologies are generally effective when the source model is identified, they falter in scenarios where the model version remains unknown, or the test set comprises outputs from various source models. To address these limitations, we present \textbf{D}istribution-\textbf{A}ligned \textbf{L}LMs \textbf{D}etection (DALD), an innovative framework that redefines the state-of-the-art performance in black-box text detection even without logits from source LLMs. DALD is designed to align the surrogate model's distribution with that of unknown target LLMs, ensuring enhanced detection capability and resilience against rapid model iterations with minimal training investment. By leveraging corpus samples from publicly accessible outputs of advanced models such as ChatGPT, GPT-4 and Claude-3, DALD fine-tunes surrogate models to synchronize with unknown source model distributions effectively. Our approach achieves SOTA performance in black-box settings on different advanced closed-source and open-source models. The versatility of our method enriches widely adopted zero-shot detection frameworks (DetectGPT, DNA-GPT, Fast-DetectGPT) with a `plug-and-play' enhancement feature. Extensive experiments validate that our methodology reliably secures high detection precision for LLM-generated text and effectively detects text from diverse model origins through a singular detector.Our method is also robust under the revised text attack and non-English texts."
Poster,DAPE: Data-Adaptive Positional Encoding for Length Extrapolation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93415,"Chuanyang Zheng, Yihang Gao, Han Shi, Minbin Huang, Jingyao Li, Jing Xiong, Xiaozhe Ren, Michael Ng, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Yu Li","Positional encoding plays a crucial role in transformers, significantly impact- ing model performance and length generalization. Prior research has introduced absolute positional encoding (APE) and relative positional encoding (RPE) to distinguish token positions in given sequences. However, both APE and RPE remain fixed after model training regardless of input data, limiting their adaptability and flexibility. Hence, we expect that the desired positional encoding should be data-adaptive and can be dynamically adjusted with the given attention. In this paper, we propose a Data-Adaptive Positional Encoding (DAPE) method, which dynamically and semantically adjusts based on input context and learned fixed priors. Experimental validation on real-world datasets (Arxiv, Books3, and CHE) demonstrates that DAPE enhances model performances in terms of trained length and length generalization, where the improvements are statistically significant. The model visualization suggests that our model can keep both local and anti-local information. Finally, we successfully train the model on sequence length 128 and achieve better performance at evaluation sequence length 8192, compared with other static positional encoding methods, revealing the benefit of the adaptive positional encoding method."
Poster,DapperFL: Domain Adaptive Federated Learning with Model Fusion Pruning for Edge Devices,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95295,"Yongzhe Jia, Xuyun Zhang, Hongsheng Hu, Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo, Lianyong Qi, Xiaolong Xu, Amin Beheshti, Wanchun Dou","Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent machine learning paradigm in edge computing environments, enabling edge devices to collaboratively optimize a global model without sharing their private data. However, existing FL frameworks suffer from efficacy deterioration due to the system heterogeneity inherent in edge computing, especially in the presence of domain shifts across local data. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous FL framework DapperFL, to enhance model performance across multiple domains. In DapperFL, we introduce a dedicated Model Fusion Pruning (MFP) module to produce personalized compact local models for clients to address the system heterogeneity challenges. The MFP module prunes local models with fused knowledge obtained from both local and remaining domains, ensuring robustness to domain shifts. Additionally, we design a Domain Adaptive Regularization (DAR) module to further improve the overall performance of DapperFL. The DAR module employs regularization generated by the pruned model, aiming to learn robust representations across domains. Furthermore, we introduce a specific aggregation algorithm for aggregating heterogeneous local models with tailored architectures and weights. We implement DapperFL on a real-world FL platform with heterogeneous clients. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with multiple domains demonstrate that DapperFL outperforms several state-of-the-art FL frameworks by up to 2.28%, while significantly achieving model volume reductions ranging from 20% to 80%.

Poster,DARG: Dynamic Evaluation of Large Language Models via Adaptive Reasoning Graph,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96593,"Zhehao Zhang, Jiaao Chen, Diyi Yang","The current paradigm of evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) through static benchmarks comes with significant limitations, such as vulnerability to data contamination and a lack of adaptability to the evolving capabilities of LLMs. Therefore, evaluation methods that can adapt and generate evaluation data with controlled complexity are urgently needed. In this work, we introduce Dynamic Evaluation of LLMs via Adaptive Reasoning Graph Evolvement (DARG) to dynamically extend current benchmarks with controlled complexity and diversity. Specifically, we first extract the reasoning graphs of data points in current benchmarks and then perturb the reasoning graphs to generate novel testing data. Such newly generated test samples can have different levels of complexity while maintaining linguistic diversity similar to the original benchmarks. We further use a code-augmented LLM to ensure the label correctness of newly generated data. We apply our DARG framework to diverse reasoning tasks in four domains with 15 state-of-the-art LLMs. Experimental results show that almost all LLMs experience a performance decrease with increased complexity and certain LLMs exhibit significant drops. Additionally, we find that LLMs exhibit more biases when being evaluated via the data generated by DARG with higher complexity levels. These observations provide useful insights into how to dynamically and adaptively evaluate LLMs."
Poster,DarkSAM: Fooling Segment Anything Model to Segment Nothing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96905,"Ziqi Zhou, Yufei Song, Minghui Li, Shengshan Hu, Xianlong Wang, Leo Yu Zhang, Dezhong Yao, Hai Jin","Segment Anything Model (SAM) has recently gained much attention for its outstanding generalization to unseen data and tasks. Despite its promising prospect, the vulnerabilities of SAM, especially to universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) have not been thoroughly investigated yet. In this paper, we propose DarkSAM, the first prompt-free universal attack framework against SAM, including a semantic decoupling-based spatial attack and a texture distortion-based frequency attack. We first divide the output of SAM into foreground and background. Then, we design a shadow target strategy to obtain the semantic blueprint of the image as the attack target. DarkSAM is dedicated to fooling SAM by extracting and destroying crucial object features from images in both spatial and frequency domains. In the spatial domain, we disrupt the semantics of both the foreground and background in the image to confuse SAM. In the frequency domain, we further enhance the attack effectiveness by distorting the high-frequency components (i.e., texture information) of the image. Consequently, with a single UAP, DarkSAM renders SAM incapable of segmenting objects across diverse images with varying prompts. Experimental results on four datasets for SAM and its two variant models demonstrate the powerful attack capability and transferability of DarkSAM.

Poster,DARNet: Dual Attention Refinement Network with Spatiotemporal Construction for Auditory Attention Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93956,"Sheng Yan, Cunhang Fan, Hongyu Zhang, Xiaoke Yang, Jianhua Tao, Zhao Lv","At a cocktail party, humans exhibit an impressive ability to direct their attention. The auditory attention detection (AAD) approach seeks to identify the attended speaker by analyzing brain signals, such as EEG signals. However, current AAD algorithms overlook the spatial distribution information within EEG signals and lack the ability to capture long-range latent dependencies, limiting the model's ability to decode brain activity.To address these issues, this paper proposes a dual attention refinement network with spatiotemporal construction for AAD, named DARNet, which consists of the spatiotemporal construction module, dual attention refinement module, and feature fusion \& classifier module. Specifically, the spatiotemporal construction module aims to construct more expressive spatiotemporal feature representations, by capturing the spatial distribution characteristics of EEG signals. The dual attention refinement module aims to extract different levels of temporal patterns in EEG signals and enhance the model's ability to capture long-range latent dependencies. The feature fusion \& classifier module aims to aggregate temporal patterns and dependencies from different levels and obtain the final classification results.The experimental results indicate that DARNet achieved excellent classification performance, particularly under short decision windows. While maintaining excellent classification performance, DARNet significantly reduces the number of required parameters. Compared to the state-of-the-art models, DARNet reduces the parameter count by 91\%. Code is available at: https://github.com/fchest/DARNet.git."
Poster,DART-Eval: A Comprehensive DNA Language Model Evaluation Benchmark on Regulatory DNA,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97497,"Aman Patel, Arpita Singhal, Austin Wang, Anusri Pampari, Maya Kasowski, Anshul Kundaje","Recent advances in self-supervised models for natural language, vision, and protein sequences have inspired the development of large genomic DNA language models (DNALMs). These models aim to learn generalizable representations of diverse DNA elements, potentially enabling various genomic prediction, interpretation and design tasks. Despite their potential, existing benchmarks do not adequately assess the capabilities of DNALMs on key downstream applications involving an important class of non-coding DNA elements critical for regulating gene activity. In this study, we introduce DART-Eval, a suite of representative benchmarks specifically focused on regulatory DNA to evaluate model performance across zero-shot, probed, and fine-tuned scenarios against contemporary ab initio models as baselines. Our benchmarks target biologically meaningful downstream tasks such as functional sequence feature discovery, predicting cell-type specific regulatory activity, and counterfactual prediction of the impacts of genetic variants. We find that current DNALMs exhibit inconsistent performance and do not offer compelling gains over alternative baseline models for most tasks, while requiring significantly more computational resources. We discuss potentially promising modeling, data curation, and evaluation strategies for the next generation of DNALMs. Our  code is available at https://github.com/kundajelab/DART-Eval"
Poster,DART-Math: Difficulty-Aware Rejection Tuning for Mathematical Problem-Solving,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92959,"Yuxuan Tong, Xiwen Zhang, Rui Wang, Ruidong Wu, Junxian He","Solving mathematical problems requires advanced reasoning abilities and presents notable challenges for large language models. Previous works usually synthesize data from proprietary models to augment existing datasets, followed by instruction tuning to achieve top-tier results. However, our analysis of these datasets reveals severe biases towards easy queries, with frequent failures to generate any correct response for the most challenging queries.Hypothesizing that difficult queries are crucial to learning complex reasoning, we propose *Difficulty-Aware Rejection Tuning* (`DART`), a method that allocates difficult queries more trials during the synthesis phase, enabling more extensive training on difficult samples.Utilizing `DART`, we have created new datasets for mathematical problem-solving that focus more on difficult queries and are substantially smaller than previous ones. Remarkably, our synthesis process solely relies on a 7B-sized open-weight model, without reliance on the commonly used proprietary GPT-4.We fine-tune various base models on our datasets ranging from 7B to 70B in size, resulting in a series of strong models called `DART-Math`.In comprehensive in-domain and out-of-domain evaluation on 6 mathematical benchmarks, `DART-Math` outperforms vanilla rejection tuning significantly, being superior or comparable to previous arts, despite using much smaller datasets and no proprietary models. Furthermore, our results position our synthetic datasets as the most effective and cost-efficient publicly available resources for advancing mathematical problem-solving. Our datasets, models and code are publicly available at https://github.com/hkust-nlp/dart-math."
Poster,DASH: Warm-Starting Neural Network Training in Stationary Settings without Loss of Plasticity,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95759,"Baekrok Shin, Junsoo Oh, Hanseul Cho, Chulhee Yun","Warm-starting neural network training by initializing networks with previously learned weights is appealing, as practical neural networks are often deployed under a continuous influx of new data. However, it often leads to *loss of plasticity*, where the network loses its ability to learn new information, resulting in worse generalization than training from scratch. This occurs even under stationary data distributions, and its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. We develop a framework emulating real-world neural network training and identify noise memorization as the primary cause of plasticity loss when warm-starting on stationary data. Motivated by this, we propose **Direction-Aware SHrinking (DASH)**, a method aiming to mitigate plasticity loss by selectively forgetting memorized noise while preserving learned features. We validate our approach on vision tasks, demonstrating improvements in test accuracy and training efficiency."
Poster,Data Acquisition via Experimental Design for Data Markets,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94889,"Charles Lu, Baihe Huang, Sai Praneeth Karimireddy, Praneeth Vepakomma, Michael Jordan, Ramesh Raskar","The acquisition of training data is crucial for machine learning applications. Data markets can increase the supply of data, particularly in data-scarce domains such as healthcare, by incentivizing potential data providers to join the market. A major challenge for a data buyer in such a market is choosing the most valuable data points from a data seller.  Unlike prior work in data valuation, which assumes centralized data access, we propose a federated approach to the data acquisition problem that is inspired by linear experimental design. Our proposed data acquisition method achieves lower prediction error without requiring labeled validation data and can be optimized in a fast and federated procedure. The key insight of our work is that a method that directly estimates the benefit of acquiring data for test set prediction is particularly compatible with a decentralized market setting."
