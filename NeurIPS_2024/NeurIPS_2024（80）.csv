Poster,Constrained Latent Action Policies for Model-Based Offline Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93572,"Marvin Alles, Philip Becker-Ehmck, Patrick van der Smagt, Maximilian Karl","In offline reinforcement learning, a policy is learned using a static dataset in the absence of costly feedback from the environment. In contrast to the online setting, only using static datasets poses additional challenges, such as policies generating out-of-distribution samples. Model-based offline reinforcement learning methods try to overcome these by learning a model of the underlying dynamics of the environment and using it to guide policy search. It is beneficial but, with limited datasets, errors in the model and the issue of value overestimation among out-of-distribution states can worsen performance. Current model-based methods apply some notion of conservatism to the Bellman update, often implemented using uncertainty estimation derived from model ensembles. In this paper, we propose Constrained Latent Action Policies (C-LAP) which learns a generative model of the joint distribution of observations and actions. We cast policy learning as a constrained objective to always stay within the support of the latent action distribution, and use the generative capabilities of the model to impose an implicit constraint on the generated actions. Thereby eliminating the need to use additional uncertainty penalties on the Bellman update and significantly decreasing the number of gradient steps required to learn a policy. We empirically evaluate C-LAP on the D4RL and V-D4RL benchmark, and show that C-LAP is competitive to state-of-the-art methods, especially outperforming on datasets with visual observations."
Poster,Constrained Sampling with Primal-Dual Langevin Monte Carlo,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93644,"Luiz Chamon, Mohammad Reza Karimi Jaghargh, Anna Korba","This work considers the problem of sampling from a probability distribution known up to a normalization constant while satisfying a set of statistical constraints specified by the expected values of general nonlinear functions. This problem finds applications in, e.g., Bayesian inference, where it can constrain moments to evaluate counterfactual scenarios or enforce desiderata such as prediction fairness. Methods developed to handle support constraints, such as those based on mirror maps, barriers, and penalties, are not suited for this task. This work therefore relies on gradient descent-ascent dynamics in Wasserstein space to put forward a discrete-time primal-dual Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm (PD-LMC) that simultaneously constrains the target distribution and samples from it. We analyze the convergence of PD-LMC under standard assumptions on the target distribution and constraints, namely (strong) convexity and log-Sobolev inequalities. To do so, we bring classical optimization arguments for saddle-point algorithms to the geometry of Wasserstein space. We illustrate the relevance and effectiveness of PD-LMC in several applications."
Poster,Constrained Synthesis with Projected Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95942,"Jacob K Christopher, Stephen Baek, Nando Fioretto","This paper introduces an approach to endow generative diffusion processes the ability to satisfy and certify compliance with constraints and physical principles. The proposed method recast the traditional sampling process of generative diffusion models as a constrained optimization problem, steering the generated data distribution to remain within a specified region to ensure adherence to the given constraints.These capabilities are validated on applications featuring both convex and challenging, non-convex, constraints as well as ordinary differential equations, in domains spanning from synthesizing new materials with precise morphometric properties, generating physics-informed motion, optimizing paths in planning scenarios, and human motion synthesis."
Poster,Constructing Semantics-Aware Adversarial Examples with a Probabilistic Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93142,"Andi Zhang, Mingtian Zhang, Damon Wischik","We propose a probabilistic perspective on adversarial examples, allowing us to embed subjective understanding of semantics as a distribution into the process of generating adversarial examples, in a principled manner. Despite significant pixel-level modifications compared to traditional adversarial attacks, our method preserves the overall semantics of the image, making the changes difficult for humans to detect. This extensive pixel-level modification enhances our method's ability to deceive classifiers designed to defend against adversarial attacks. Our empirical findings indicate that the proposed methods achieve higher success rates in circumventing adversarial defense mechanisms, while remaining difficult for human observers to detect."
Poster,Construction and Application of Materials Knowledge Graph in Multidisciplinary Materials Science via Large Language Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95920,"Yanpeng Ye, Jie Ren, Shaozhou Wang, Yuwei Wan, Imran Razzak, Bram Hoex, Haofen Wang, Tong Xie, Wenjie Zhang","Knowledge in materials science is widely dispersed across extensive scientific literature, posing significant challenges for efficient discovery and integration of new materials. Traditional methods, often reliant on costly and time-consuming experimental approaches, further complicate rapid innovation. Addressing these challenges, the integration of artificial intelligence with materials science has opened avenues for accelerating the discovery process, though it also demands precise annotation, data extraction, and traceability of information. To tackle these issues, this article introduces the Materials Knowledge Graph (MKG), which utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques, integrated with large language models to extract and systematically organize a decade's worth of high-quality research into structured triples, contains 162,605 nodes and 731,772 edges. MKG categorizes information into comprehensive labels such as Name, Formula, and Application, structured around a meticulously designed ontology, thus enhancing data usability and integration. By implementing network-based algorithms, MKG not only facilitates efficient link prediction but also significantly reduces reliance on traditional experimental methods. This structured approach not only streamlines materials research but also lays the groundwork for more sophisticated materials knowledge graphs."
Poster,ContactField: Implicit Field Representation for Multi-Person Interaction Geometry,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96417,"Hansol Lee, Tackgeun You, Hansoo Park, Woohyeon Shim, Sanghyeon Kim, Hwasup Lim","We introduce a novel implicit field representation tailored for multi-person interaction geometry in 3D spaces, capable of simultaneously reconstructing occupancy, instance identification (ID) tags, and contact fields. Volumetric representation of interacting human bodies presents significant  challenges, including inaccurately captured geometries, varying degrees of occlusion, and data scarcity. Existing multi-view methods, which either reconstruct each subject in isolation or merge nearby 3D surfaces into a single unified mesh, often fail to capture the intricate geometry between interacting bodies and exploit on datasets with many views and a small group of people for training. Our approach utilizes an implicit representation for interaction geometry contextualized by a multi-view local-global feature module. This module adeptly aggregates both local and global information from individual views and interacting groups, enabling precise modeling of close physical interactions through dense point retrieval in small areas, supported by the implicit fields. Furthermore, we develop a synthetic dataset encompassing diverse multi-person interaction scenarios to enhance the robustness of our geometry estimation. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method to accurately reconstruct human geometries and ID tags within three-dimensional spaces, outperforming conventional multi-view techniques. Notably, our method facilitates unsupervised estimation of contact points without the need for specific training data on contact supervision."
Poster,Context and Geometry Aware Voxel Transformer for Semantic Scene Completion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96303,"Zhu Yu, Runmin Zhang, Jiacheng Ying, Junchen Yu, Xiaohai Hu, Lun Luo, Si-Yuan Cao, Hui-liang Shen","Vision-based Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained much attention due to its widespread applications in various 3D perception tasks. Existing sparse-to-dense approaches typically employ shared context-independent queries across various input images, which fails to capture distinctions among them as the focal regions of different inputs vary and may result in undirected feature aggregation of cross-attention. Additionally, the absence of depth information may lead to points projected onto the image plane sharing the same 2D position or similar sampling points in the feature map, resulting in depth ambiguity. In this paper, we present a novel context and geometry aware voxel transformer. It utilizes a context aware query generator to initialize context-dependent queries tailored to individual input images, effectively capturing their unique characteristics and aggregating information within the region of interest. Furthermore, it extend deformable cross-attention from 2D to 3D pixel space, enabling the differentiation of points with similar image coordinates based on their depth coordinates. Building upon this module, we introduce a neural network named CGFormer to achieve semantic scene completion. Simultaneously, CGFormer leverages multiple 3D representations (i.e., voxel and TPV) to boost the semantic and geometric representation abilities of the transformed 3D volume from both local and global perspectives. Experimental results demonstrate that CGFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, attaining a mIoU of 16.87 and 20.05, as well as an IoU of 45.99 and 48.07, respectively. Remarkably, CGFormer even outperforms approaches employing temporal images as inputs or much larger image backbone networks."
Poster,Context-Aware Testing: A New Paradigm for Model Testing with Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94363,"Paulius Rauba, Nabeel Seedat, Max Ruiz Luyten, Mihaela van der Schaar","The predominant *de facto* paradigm of testing ML models relies on either using only held-out data to compute aggregate evaluation metrics or by assessing the performance on different subgroups.  However, such *data-only testing* methods operate under the restrictive assumption that the available empirical data is the sole input for testing ML models, disregarding valuable contextual information that could guide model testing. In this paper, we challenge the go-to approach of *data-only testing* and introduce *Context-Aware Testing* (CAT) which uses context as an inductive bias to guide the search for meaningful model failures. We instantiate the first CAT system, *SMART Testing*, which employs large language models to hypothesize relevant and likely failures, which are evaluated on data using a *self-falsification mechanism*. Through empirical evaluations in diverse settings, we show that SMART automatically identifies more relevant and impactful failures than alternatives, demonstrating the potential of CAT as a testing paradigm."
Poster,ContextCite: Attributing Model Generation to Context,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96474,"Benjamin Cohen-Wang, Harshay Shah, Kristian Georgiev, Aleksander Madry","How do language models use information provided as context when generating a response?Can we infer whether a particular generated statement is actually grounded in the context, a misinterpretation, or fabricated?To help answer these questions, we introduce the problem of *context attribution*: pinpointing the parts of the context (if any) that *led* a model to generate a particular statement.We then present ContextCite, a simple and scalable method for context attribution that can be applied on top of any existing language model.Finally, we showcase the utility of ContextCite through three applications:(1) helping verify generated statements(2) improving response quality by pruning the context and(3) detecting poisoning attacks.We provide code for ContextCite at https://github.com/MadryLab/context-cite."
Poster,ContextGS : Compact 3D Gaussian Splatting with Anchor Level Context Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94859,"Yufei Wang, Zhihao Li, Lanqing Guo, Wenhan Yang, Alex Kot, Bihan Wen","Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a promising framework for novel view synthesis, offering fast rendering speeds and high fidelity. However, the large number of Gaussians and their associated attributes require effective compression techniques. Existing methods primarily compress neural Gaussians individually and independently, i.e., coding all the neural Gaussians at the same time, with little design for their interactions and spatial dependence. Inspired by the effectiveness of the context model in image compression, we propose the first autoregressive model at the anchor level for 3DGS compression in this work. We divide anchors into different levels and the anchors that are not coded yet can be predicted based on the already coded ones in all the coarser levels, leading to more accurate modeling and higher coding efficiency. To further improve the efficiency of entropy coding, e.g., to code the coarsest level with no already coded anchors, we propose to introduce a low-dimensional quantized feature as the hyperprior for each anchor, which can be effectively compressed. Our work pioneers the context model in the anchor level for 3DGS representation, yielding an impressive size reduction of over 100 times compared to vanilla 3DGS and 15 times compared to the most recent state-of-the-art work Scaffold-GS, while achieving comparable or even higher rendering quality."
