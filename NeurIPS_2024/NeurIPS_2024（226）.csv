Poster,Learning Noisy Halfspaces with a Margin: Massart is No Harder than Random,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96035,"Gautam Chandrasekaran, Vasilis Kontonis, Konstantinos Stavropoulos, Kevin Tian","We study the problem of PAC learning $\gamma$-margin halfspaces with Massart noise. We propose a simple  proper learning algorithm, the Perspectron, that has sample complexity $\widetilde{O}((\epsilon\gamma)^{-2})$ and achieves classification error at most $\eta+\epsilon$ where $\eta$ is the Massart noise rate.  Prior works (DGT19, CKMY20)  came with worse sample complexity guarantees (in both $\epsilon$ and $\gamma$) or could only handle random classification noise (DDKWZ23,KITBMV23)--- a much milder noise assumption. We also show that our results extend to the more challenging setting of learning generalized linear models with a known link function under Massart noise, achieving a similar sample complexity to the halfspace case. This significantly improves upon the prior state-of-the-art in this setting due to CKMY20, who introduced this model."
Poster,Learning on Large Graphs using Intersecting Communities,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93568,"Ben Finkelshtein, Ismail Ceylan, Michael Bronstein, Ron Levie","Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are a staple of graph machine learning. MPNNs iteratively update each node’s representation in an input graph by aggregating messages from the node’s neighbors, which necessitates a memory complexity of the order of the __number of graph edges__. This complexity might quickly become  prohibitive for large graphs provided they are not very sparse.  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to alleviate this problem by  approximating the input graph as an  intersecting community graph (ICG) -- a combination of intersecting cliques. The key insight is that the number of communities required to approximate a graph  __does not depend on the graph size__. We develop a new constructive version of the Weak Graph Regularity Lemma to efficiently construct an approximating ICG for any input graph. We then devise an efficient graph learning algorithm operating directly on ICG in linear memory and time with respect to the __number of nodes__ (rather than edges).  This offers a new and fundamentally different pipeline for learning on very large non-sparse graphs, whose applicability is demonstrated empirically on node classification tasks and spatio-temporal data processing."
Poster,Learning Optimal Lattice Vector Quantizers for End-to-end Neural Image Compression,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94342,"Xi Zhang, Xiaolin Wu","It is customary to deploy uniform scalar quantization in the end-to-end optimized Neural image compression methods, instead of more powerful vector quantization, due to the high complexity of the latter. Lattice vector quantization (LVQ), on the other hand, presents a compelling alternative, which can exploit inter-feature dependencies more effectively while keeping computational efficiency almost the same as scalar quantization. However, traditional LVQ structures are designed/optimized for uniform source distributions, hence nonadaptive and suboptimal for real source distributions of latent code space for Neural image compression tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel learning method to overcome this weakness by designing the rate-distortion optimal lattice vector quantization (OLVQ) codebooks with respect to the sample statistics of the latent features to be compressed. By being able to better fit the LVQ structures to any given latent sample distribution, the proposed OLVQ method improves the rate-distortion performances of the existing quantization schemes in neural image compression significantly, while retaining the amenability of uniform scalar quantization."
Poster,Learning Optimal Tax Design in Nonatomic Congestion Games,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95251,"Qiwen Cui, Maryam Fazel, Simon Du","In multiplayer games, self-interested behavior among the players can harm the social welfare. Tax mechanisms are a common method to alleviate this issue and induce socially optimal behavior. In this work, we take the initial step of learning the optimal tax that can maximize social welfare with limited feedback in congestion games. We propose a new type of feedback named \emph{equilibrium feedback}, where the tax designer can only observe the Nash equilibrium after deploying a tax plan. Existing algorithms are not applicable due to the exponentially large tax function space, nonexistence of the gradient, and nonconvexity of the objective. To tackle these challenges, we design a computationally efficient algorithm that leverages several novel components: (1) a piece-wise linear tax to approximate the optimal tax; (2) extra linear terms to guarantee a strongly convex potential function; (3) an efficient subroutine to find the exploratory tax that can provide critical information about the game. The algorithm can find an $\epsilon$-optimal tax with $O(\beta F^2/\epsilon)$ sample complexity, where $\beta$ is the smoothness of the cost function and $F$ is the number of facilities."
Poster,Learning Partitions from Context,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93551,Simon Buchholz,"In this paper, we study the problem of learning the structure of a discrete set of $N$ tokens based on their interactions with other tokens. We focus on a setting where the tokens can be partitioned into a small number of classes, and there exists a real-valued function $f$ defined on certain sets of tokens. This function, which captures the interactions between tokens, depends only on the class memberships of its arguments. The goal is to recover the class memberships of all tokens from a finite number of samples of $f$. We begin by analyzing this problem from both complexity-theoretic and information-theoretic viewpoints. We prove that it is NP-complete in general, and for random instances, we show that on the order of $N\ln(N)$ samples, implying very sparse interactions, suffice to identify the partition. We then investigate the conditions under which gradient flow dynamics of token embeddings can reveal the class structure, finding that this is achievable in certain settings when given on the order of $N^2\ln^2(N)$ samples."
Poster,Learning Place Cell Representations and Context-Dependent Remapping,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96470,"Markus Pettersen, Frederik Rogge, Mikkel Lepperød","Hippocampal place cells are known for their spatially selective firing patterns, which has led to the suggestion that they encode an animal's location. However, place cells also respond to contextual cues, such as smell. Furthermore, they have the ability to remap, wherein the firing fields and rates of cells change in response to changes in the environment. How place cell responses emerge, and how these representations remap is not fully understood. In this work, we propose a similarity-based objective function that translates proximity in space, to proximity in representation. We show that a neural network trained to minimize the proposed objective learns place-like representations. We also show that the proposed objective is easily extended to include other sources of information, such as context information, in the same way. When trained to encode multiple contexts, networks learn distinct representations, exhibiting remapping behaviors between contexts. The proposed objective is invariant to orthogonal transformations. Such transformations of the original trained representation (e.g. rotations), therefore yield new representations distinct from the original, without explicit relearning, akin to remapping. Our findings shed new light on the formation and encoding properties of place cells, and also demonstrate an interesting case of representational reuse."
Poster,Learning Plaintext-Ciphertext Cryptographic Problems via ANF-based SAT Instance Representation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95937,"Xinhao Zheng, Yang Li, Cunxin Fan, Huaijin Wu, Xinhao Song, Junchi Yan","Cryptographic problems, operating within binary variable spaces, can be routinely transformed into Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems regarding specific cryptographic conditions like plaintext-ciphertext matching. With the fast development of learning for discrete data, this SAT representation also facilitates the utilization of machine-learning approaches with the hope of automatically capturing patterns and strategies inherent in cryptographic structures in a data-driven manner. Existing neural SAT solvers consistently adopt conjunctive normal form (CNF) for instance representation, which in the cryptographic context can lead to scale explosion and a loss of high-level semantics. In particular, extensively used XOR operations in cryptographic problems can incur an exponential number of clauses. In this paper, we propose a graph structure based on Arithmetic Normal Form (ANF) to efficiently handle the XOR operation bottleneck. Additionally, we design an encoding method for AND operations in these ANF-based graphs, demonstrating improved efficiency over alternative general graph forms for SAT. We then propose CryptoANFNet, a graph learning approach that trains a classifier based on a message-passing scheme to predict plaintext-ciphertext satisfiability. Using ANF-based SAT instances, CryptoANFNet demonstrates superior scalability and can naturally capture higher-order operational information. Empirically, CryptoANFNet achieves a 50x speedup over heuristic solvers and outperforms SOTA learning-based SAT solver NeuroSAT, with 96\% vs. 91\% accuracy on small-scale and 72\% vs. 55\% on large-scale datasets from real encryption algorithms. We also introduce a key-solving algorithm that simplifies ANF-based SAT instances from plaintext and ciphertext, enhancing key decryption accuracy from 76.5\% to 82\% and from 72\% to 75\% for datasets generated from two real encryption algorithms."
Poster,Learning predictable and robust neural representations by straightening image sequences,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94198,"Julie Xueyan Niu, Cristina Savin, Eero Simoncelli","Prediction is a fundamental capability of all living organisms, and has been proposed as an objective for learning sensory representations.  Recent work demonstrates that in primate visual systems, prediction is facilitated by neural representations that follow straighter temporal trajectories than their initial photoreceptor encoding, which allows for prediction by linear extrapolation. Inspired by these experimental findings, we develop a self-supervised learning (SSL) objective that explicitly quantifies and promotes straightening. We demonstrate the power of this objective in training deep feedforward neural networks on smoothly-rendered synthetic image sequences that mimic commonly-occurring properties of natural videos. The learned model contains neural embeddings that are predictive, but also factorize the geometric, photometric, and semantic attributes of objects. The representations also prove more robust to noise and adversarial attacks compared to previous SSL methods that optimize for invariance to random augmentations. Moreover, these beneficial properties can be transferred to other training procedures by using the straightening objective as a regularizer, suggesting a broader utility for straightening as a principle for robust unsupervised learning."
Poster,Learning Representations for Hierarchies with Minimal Support,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95845,"Benjamin Rozonoyer, Michael Boratko, Dhruvesh Patel, Wenlong Zhao, Shib Dasgupta, Hung Le, Andrew McCallum","When training node embedding models to represent large directed graphs (digraphs), it is impossible to observe all entries of the adjacency matrix during training. As a consequence most methods employ sampling. For very large digraphs, however, this means many (most) entries may be unobserved during training. In general, observing every entry would be necessary to uniquely identify a graph, however if we know the graph has a certain property some entries can be omitted - for example, only half the entries would be required for a symmetric graph. In this work, we develop a novel framework to identify a subset of entries required to uniquely distinguish a graph among all transitively-closed DAGs. We give an explicit algorithm to compute the provably minimal set of entries, and demonstrate empirically that one can train node embedding models with greater efficiency and performance, provided the energy function has an appropriate inductive bias. We achieve robust performance on synthetic hierarchies and a larger real-world taxonomy, observing improved convergence rates in a resource-constrained setting while reducing the set of training examples by as much as 99%."
Poster,Learning rigid-body simulators over implicit shapes for large-scale scenes and vision,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95252,"Yulia Rubanova, Tatiana Lopez-Guevara, Kelsey Allen, Will Whitney, Kimberly Stachenfeld, Tobias Pfaff","Simulating large scenes with many rigid objects is crucial for a variety of applications, such as robotics, engineering, film and video games. Rigid interactions are notoriously hard to model: small changes to the initial state or the simulation parameters can lead to large changes in the final state. Recently, learned simulators based on graph networks (GNNs) were developed as an alternative to hand-designed simulators like MuJoCo and Bullet. They are able to accurately capture dynamics of real objects directly from real-world observations. However, current state-of-the-art learned simulators operate on meshes and scale poorly to scenes with many objects or detailed shapes. Here we present SDF-Sim, the first learned rigid-body simulator designed for scale. We use learned signed-distance functions (SDFs) to represent the object shapes and to speed up distance computation. We design the simulator to leverage SDFs and avoid the fundamental bottleneck of the previous simulators associated with collision detection.For the first time in literature, we demonstrate that we can scale the GNN-based simulators to scenes with hundreds of objects and up to 1.1 million nodes, where mesh-based approaches run out of memory. Finally, we show that SDF-Sim can be applied to real world scenes by extracting SDFs from multi-view images."
