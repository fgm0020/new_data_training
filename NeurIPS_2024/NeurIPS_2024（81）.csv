Poster,Contextual Active Model Selection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94616,"Xuefeng Liu, Fangfang Xia, Rick Stevens, Yuxin Chen","While training models and labeling data are resource-intensive, a wealth of pre-trained models and unlabeled data exists. To effectively utilize these resources, we present an approach to actively select pre-trained models while minimizing labeling costs. We frame this as an online contextual active model selection problem: At each round, the learner receives an unlabeled data point as a context. The objective is to adaptively select the best model to make a prediction while limiting label requests. To tackle this problem, we propose CAMS, a contextual active model selection algorithm that relies on two novel components: (1) a contextual model selection mechanism, which leverages context information to make informed decisions about which model is likely to perform best for a given context, and (2)an active query component, which strategically chooses when to request labels for data points, minimizing the overall labeling cost. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis for the regret and query complexity under both adversarial and stochastic settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on a diverse collection of benchmark classification tasks. Notably, CAMS requires substantially less labeling effort (less than 10%) compared to existing methods on CIFAR10 and DRIFT benchmarks, while achieving similar or better accuracy."
Poster,Contextual Bilevel Reinforcement Learning for Incentive Alignment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94858,"Vinzenz Thoma, Barna Pásztor, Andreas Krause, Giorgia Ramponi, Yifan Hu","The optimal policy in various real-world strategic decision-making problems depends both on the environmental configuration and exogenous events. For these settings, we introduce Contextual Bilevel Reinforcement Learning (CB-RL), a stochastic bilevel decision-making model, where the lower level consists of solving a contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP). CB-RL can be viewed as a Stackelberg Game where the leader and a random context beyond the leader’s control together decide the setup of many MDPs that potentially multiple followers best respond to. This framework extends beyond traditional bilevel optimization and finds relevance in diverse fields such as RLHF, tax design, reward shaping, contract theory and mechanism design. We propose a stochastic Hyper Policy Gradient Descent (HPGD) algorithm to solve CB-RL, and demonstrate its convergence. Notably, HPGD uses stochastic hypergradient estimates, based on observations of the followers’ trajectories. Therefore, it allows followers to use any training procedure and the leader to be agnostic of the specific algorithm, which aligns with various real-world scenarios. We further consider the setting when the leader can influence the training of followers and propose an accelerated algorithm. We empirically demonstrate the performance of our algorithm for reward shaping and tax design."
Poster,Contextual Decision-Making with Knapsacks Beyond the Worst Case,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96079,"Zhaohua Chen, Rui Ai, Mingwei Yang, Yuqi Pan, Chang Wang, Xiaotie Deng","We study the framework of a dynamic decision-making scenario with resource constraints.In this framework, an agent, whose target is to maximize the total reward under the initial inventory, selects an action in each round upon observing a random request, leading to a reward and resource consumptions that are further associated with an unknown random external factor.While previous research has already established an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ worst-case regret for this problem, this work offers two results that go beyond the worst-case perspective: one for the worst-case gap between benchmarks and another for logarithmic regret rates.We first show that an $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ distance between the commonly used fluid benchmark and the online optimum is unavoidable when the former has a degenerate optimal solution.On the algorithmic side, we merge the re-solving heuristic with distribution estimation skills and propose an algorithm that achieves an $\widetilde{O}(1)$ regret as long as the fluid LP has a unique and non-degenerate solution.Furthermore, we prove that our algorithm maintains a near-optimal $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret even in the worst cases and extend these results to the setting where the request and external factor are continuous.Regarding information structure, our regret results are obtained under two feedback models, respectively, where the algorithm accesses the external factor at the end of each round and at the end of a round only when a non-null action is executed."
Poster,Contextual Linear Optimization with Bandit Feedback,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93834,"Yichun Hu, Nathan Kallus, Xiaojie Mao, Yanchen Wu","Contextual linear optimization (CLO) uses predictive contextual features to reduce uncertainty in random cost coefficients and thereby improve average-cost performance. An example is the stochastic shortest path problem with random edge costs (e.g., traffic) and contextual features (e.g., lagged traffic, weather). Existing work on CLO assumes the data has fully observed cost coefficient vectors, but in many applications, we can only see the realized cost of a historical decision, that is, just one projection of the random cost coefficient vector, to which we refer as bandit feedback. We study a class of offline learning algorithms for CLO with bandit feedback, which we term induced empirical risk minimization (IERM), where we fit a predictive model to directly optimize the downstream performance of the policy it induces. We show a fast-rate regret bound for IERM that allows for misspecified model classes and flexible choices of the optimization estimate, and we develop computationally tractable surrogate losses. A byproduct of our theory of independent interest is fast-rate regret bound for IERM with full feedback and misspecified policy class. We compare the performance of different modeling choices numerically using a stochastic shortest path example and provide practical insights from the empirical results."
Poster,Contextual Multinomial Logit Bandits with General Value Functions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96796,"Mengxiao Zhang, Haipeng Luo","Contextual multinomial logit (MNL) bandits capture many real-world assortment recommendation problems such as online retailing/advertising. However, prior work has only considered (generalized) linear value functions, which greatly limits its applicability. Motivated by this fact, in this work, we consider contextual MNL bandits with a general value function class that contains the ground truth, borrowing ideas from a recent trend of studies on contextual bandits. Specifically, we consider both the stochastic and the adversarial settings, and propose a suite of algorithms, each with different computation-regret trade-off. When applied to the linear case, our results not only are the first ones with no dependence on a certain problem-dependent constant that can be exponentially large, but also enjoy other advantages such as computational efficiency, dimension-free regret bounds, or the ability to handle completely adversarial contexts and rewards."
Poster,Continual Audio-Visual Sound Separation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95301,"Weiguo Pian, Yiyang Nan, Shijian Deng, Shentong Mo, Yunhui Guo, Yapeng Tian","In this paper, we introduce a novel continual audio-visual sound separation task, aiming to continuously separate sound sources for new classes while preserving performance on previously learned classes, with the aid of visual guidance. This problem is crucial for practical visually guided auditory perception as it can significantly enhance the adaptability and robustness of audio-visual sound separation models, making them more applicable for real-world scenarios where encountering new sound sources is commonplace. The task is inherently challenging as our models must not only effectively utilize information from both modalities in current tasks but also preserve their cross-modal association in old tasks to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during audio-visual continual learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach named ContAV-Sep ($\textbf{Cont}$inual $\textbf{A}$udio-$\textbf{V}$isual Sound $\textbf{Sep}$aration). ContAV-Sep presents a novel Cross-modal Similarity Distillation Constraint (CrossSDC) to uphold the cross-modal semantic similarity through incremental tasks and retain previously acquired knowledge of semantic similarity in old models, mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting. The CrossSDC can seamlessly integrate into the training process of different audio-visual sound separation frameworks. Experiments demonstrate that ContAV-Sep can effectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting and achieve significantly better performance compared to other continual learning baselines for audio-visual sound separation. Code is available at: https://github.com/weiguoPian/ContAV-Sep_NeurIPS2024."
Poster,Continual Counting with Gradual Privacy Expiration,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94923,"Joel Daniel Andersson, Monika Henzinger, Rasmus Pagh, Teresa Steiner, Jalaj Upadhyay","Differential privacy with gradual expiration models the setting where data items arrive in a stream and at a given time $t$ the privacy loss guaranteed for a data item seen at time $(t-d)$ is $\epsilon g(d)$, where $g$ is a monotonically non-decreasing function. We study the fundamental *continual (binary) counting* problem where each data item consists of a bit and the algorithm needs to output at each time step the sum of all the bits streamed so far. For a stream of length $T$ and privacy *without* expiration continual counting is possible with maximum  (over all time steps) additive error $O(\log^2(T)/\varepsilon)$ and the best known lower bound is $\Omega(\log(T)/\varepsilon)$; closing this gap is a challenging open problem. We show that the situation is very different for privacy with gradual expiration by giving upper and lower bounds for a large set of expiration functions $g$. Specifically, our algorithm achieves an additive error of $O(\log(T)/\epsilon)$ for a large set of privacy expiration functions. We also give a lower bound that shows that if $C$ is the additive error of any $\epsilon$-DP algorithm for this problem, then the product of $C$ and the privacy expiration function after $2C$ steps must be $\Omega(\log(T)/\epsilon)$. Our algorithm matches this lower bound as its additive error is $O(\log(T)/\epsilon)$, even when $g(2C) = O(1)$.Our empirical evaluation shows that we achieve a slowly growing privacy loss that has significantly smaller empirical privacy loss for large values of $d$ than a natural baseline algorithm."
Poster,Continual Learning in the Frequency Domain,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94751,"RuiQi Liu, Boyu Diao, Libo Huang, Zijia An, Zhulin An, Yongjun Xu","Continual learning (CL) is designed to learn new tasks while preserving existing knowledge. Replaying samples from earlier tasks has proven to be an effective method to mitigate the forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. However, the current research on the training efficiency of rehearsal-based methods is insufficient, which limits the practical application of CL systems in resource-limited scenarios. The human visual system (HVS) exhibits varying sensitivities to different frequency components, enabling the efficient elimination of visually redundant information. Inspired by HVS, we propose a novel framework called Continual Learning in the Frequency Domain (CLFD). To our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize frequency domain features to enhance the performance and efficiency of CL training on edge devices. For the input features of the feature extractor, CLFD employs wavelet transform to map the original input image into the frequency domain, thereby effectively reducing the size of input feature maps. Regarding the output features of the feature extractor, CLFD selectively utilizes output features for distinct classes for classification, thereby balancing the reusability and interference of output features based on the frequency domain similarity of the classes across various tasks. Optimizing only the input and output features of the feature extractor allows for seamless integration of CLFD with various rehearsal-based methods. Extensive experiments conducted in both cloud and edge environments demonstrate that CLFD consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both precision and training efficiency. Specifically, CLFD can increase the accuracy of the SOTA CL method by up to 6.83% and reduce the training time by 2.6×."
Poster,Continual Learning with Global Alignment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96625,"Xueying Bai, Jinghuan Shang, Yifan Sun, Niranjan Balasubramanian","Continual learning aims to sequentially learn new tasks without forgetting previous tasks' knowledge (catastrophic forgetting). One factor that can cause forgetting is the interference between the gradients on losses from different tasks. When the gradients on the current task's loss are in opposing directions to those on previous tasks' losses, updating the model for the current task may cause performance degradation on previous tasks. In this paper, we first identify causes of the above interference, and hypothesize that correlations between data representations are a key factor of interference. We then propose a method for promoting appropriate correlations between arbitrary tasks' data representations (i.e., global alignment) in individual task learning. Specifically, we learn the data representation as a task-specific composition of pre-trained token representations shared across all tasks. Then the correlations between different tasks' data representations are grounded by correlations between pre-trained token representations. We explore different ways to learn such compositions. Without experience replay, our model achieves SOTA performance in continual learning tasks. It also achieves advanced class-incremental performance through task-incremental training."
Poster,Continual learning with the neural tangent ensemble,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93499,"Ari Benjamin, Christian-Gernot Pehle, Kyle Daruwalla","A natural strategy for continual learning is to weigh a Bayesian ensemble of fixed functions. This suggests that if a (single) neural network could be interpreted as an ensemble, one could design effective algorithms that learn without forgetting. To realize this possibility, we observe that a neural network classifier with N parameters can be interpreted as a weighted ensemble of N classifiers, and that in the lazy regime limit these classifiers are fixed throughout learning. We call these classifiers the *neural tangent experts* and show they output valid probability distributions over the labels. We then derive the likelihood and posterior probability of each expert given past data. Surprisingly,  the posterior updates for these experts are equivalent to a scaled and projected form of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) over the network weights. Away from the lazy regime, networks can be seen as ensembles of adaptive experts which improve over time. These results offer a new interpretation of neural networks as Bayesian ensembles of experts, providing a principled framework for understanding and mitigating catastrophic forgetting in continual learning settings."
