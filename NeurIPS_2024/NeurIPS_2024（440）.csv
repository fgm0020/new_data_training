Poster,VisionLLM v2: An End-to-End Generalist Multimodal Large Language Model for Hundreds of Vision-Language Tasks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93655,"Jiannan Wu, Muyan Zhong, Sen Xing, Zeqiang Lai, Zhaoyang Liu, Zhe Chen, Wenhai Wang, Xizhou Zhu, Lewei Lu, Tong Lu, Ping Luo, Yu Qiao, Jifeng Dai","We present VisionLLM v2, an end-to-end generalist multimodal large model (MLLM) that unifies visual perception, understanding, and generation within a single framework. Unlike traditional MLLMs limited to text output, VisionLLM v2 significantly broadens its application scope. It excels not only in conventional visual question answering (VQA) but also in open-ended, cross-domain vision tasks such as object localization, pose estimation, and image generation and editing. To this end, we propose a new information transmission mechanism termed ``super link'', as a medium to connect MLLM with task-specific decoders. It not only allows flexible transmission of task information and gradient feedback between the MLLM and multiple downstream decoders but also effectively resolves training conflicts in multi-tasking scenarios. In addition, to support the diverse range of tasks, we carefully collected and combed training data from hundreds of public vision and vision-language tasks. In this way, our model can be joint-trained end-to-end on hundreds of vision language tasks and generalize to these tasks using a set of shared parameters through different user prompts, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. We believe VisionLLM v2 will offer a new perspective on the generalization of MLLMs."
Poster,Vision Mamba Mender,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96306,"Jiacong Hu, Anda Cao, Zunlei Feng, Shengxuming Zhang, Yi Wang, Lingxiang Jia, Mingli Song","Mamba, a state-space model with selective mechanisms and hardware-aware architecture, has demonstrated outstanding performance in long sequence modeling tasks, particularly garnering widespread exploration and application in the field of computer vision. While existing works have mixed opinions of its application in visual tasks, the exploration of its internal workings and the optimization of its performance remain urgent and worthy research questions given its status as a novel model. Existing optimizations of the Mamba model, especially when applied in the visual domain, have primarily relied on predefined methods such as improving scanning mechanisms or integrating other architectures, often requiring strong priors and extensive trial and error. In contrast to these approaches, this paper proposes the Vision Mamba Mender, a systematic approach for understanding the workings of Mamba, identifying flaws within, and subsequently optimizing model performance. Specifically, we present methods for predictive correlation analysis of Mamba's hidden states from both internal and external perspectives, along with corresponding definitions of correlation scores, aimed at understanding the workings of Mamba in visual recognition tasks and identifying flaws therein. Additionally, tailored repair methods are proposed for identified external and internal state flaws to eliminate them and optimize model performance. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed methods on prevalent Mamba architectures, significantly enhancing Mamba's performance."
Poster,Vision Model Pre-training on Interleaved Image-Text Data via Latent Compression Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92974,"CHENYU YANG, Xizhou Zhu, Jinguo Zhu, Weijie Su, Junjie Wang, Xuan Dong, Wenhai Wang, Bin Li, Jie Zhou, Yu Qiao, Jifeng Dai","Recently, vision model pre-training has evolved from relying on manually annotated datasets to leveraging large-scale, web-crawled image-text data. Despite these advances, there is no pre-training method that effectively exploits the interleaved image-text data, which is very prevalent on the Internet. Inspired by the recent success of compression learning in natural language processing, we propose a novel vision model pre-training method called Latent Compression Learning (LCL) for interleaved image-text data. This method performs latent compression learning by maximizing the mutual information between the inputs and outputs of a causal attention model. The training objective can be decomposed into two basic tasks: 1) contrastive learning between visual representation and preceding context, and 2) generating subsequent text based on visual representation. Our experiments demonstrate that our method not only matches the performance of CLIP on paired pre-training datasets (e.g., LAION), but can also leverage interleaved pre-training data (e.g., MMC4) to learn robust visual representations from scratch, showcasing the potential of vision model pre-training with interleaved image-text data."
Poster,Vision Transformer Neural Architecture Search for Out-of-Distribution Generalization: Benchmark and Insights,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96829,"Sy-Tuyen Ho, Tuan Van Vo, Somayeh Ebrahimkhani, Ngai-Man (Man) Cheung","While Vision Transformer (ViT) have achieved success across various machine learning tasks, deploying them in real-world scenarios faces a critical challenge: generalizing under Out-of-Distribution (OoD) shifts. A crucial research gap remains in understanding how to design ViT architectures – both manually and automatically – to excel in OoD generalization. **To address this gap,** we introduce OoD-ViT-NAS, the first systematic benchmark for ViT Neural Architecture Search (NAS) focused on OoD generalization. This comprehensive benchmark includes 3,000 ViT architectures of varying model computational budgets evaluated on common large-scale OoD datasets. With this comprehensive benchmark at hand, we analyze the factors that contribute to the OoD generalization of ViT architecture. Our analysis uncovers several key insights. Firstly, we show that ViT architecture designs have a considerable impact on OoD generalization. Secondly, we observe that In-Distribution (ID) accuracy might not be a very good indicator of OoD accuracy. This underscores the risk that ViT architectures optimized for ID accuracy might not perform well under OoD shifts. Thirdly, we conduct the first study to explore NAS for ViT’s OoD robustness. Specifically, we study 9 Training-free NAS for their OoD generalization performance on our benchmark. We observe that existing Training-free NAS are largely ineffective in predicting OoD accuracy despite their effectiveness at predicting ID accuracy. Moreover, simple proxies like #Param or #Flop surprisingly outperform more complex Training-free NAS in predicting ViTs OoD accuracy. Finally, we study how ViT architectural attributes impact OoD generalization. We discover that increasing embedding dimensions of a ViT architecture generally can improve the OoD generalization. We show that ViT architectures in our benchmark exhibit a wide range of OoD accuracy, with up to 11.85% for some OoD shift, prompting the importance to study ViT architecture design for OoD. We firmly believe that our OoD-ViT-NAS benchmark and our analysis can catalyze and streamline important research on understanding how ViT architecture designs influence OoD generalization. **Our OoD-NAS-ViT benchmark and code are available at [https://hosytuyen.github.io/projects/OoD-ViT-NAS](https://hosytuyen.github.io/projects/OoD-ViT-NAS)**"
Poster,VisMin: Visual Minimal-Change Understanding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94495,"Rabiul Awal, Saba Ahmadi, LE ZHANG, Aishwarya Agrawal","Fine-grained understanding of objects, attributes, and relationships between objects is crucial for visual-language models (VLMs). To evaluate VLMs' fine-grained understanding, existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating VLMs' capability to distinguish between two very similar captions given an image. In this paper, our focus is on evaluating VLMs' capability to distinguish between two very similar images given a caption. To this end, we introduce a new, challenging benchmark termed Visual Minimal-Change Understanding (VisMin), which requires models to predict the correct image-caption match given two images and two captions. Importantly, the image pair (as well as the caption pair) contains minimal changes, i.e., between the two images (as well as between the two captions), only one aspect changes at a time from among the following possible types of changes: object, attribute, count, and spatial relation. These four types of minimal changes are specifically designed to test the models' understanding of objects, attributes of objects (such as color, material, shape), counts of objects, and spatial relationships between objects. To curate our benchmark, we built an automatic pipeline using large language models and diffusion models, followed by a rigorous 4-step verification process by human annotators. Empirical experiments reveal that current VLMs exhibit notable deficiencies in understanding spatial relationships and counting abilities. Furthermore, leveraging the automated nature of our data creation process, we generate a large-scale training dataset, which we use to finetune CLIP (a foundational VLM) and Idefics2 (a multimodal large language model). Our findings show that both these models benefit significantly from fine-tuning on this data, as evident by marked improvements in fine-grained understanding across a wide range of benchmarks. Additionally, such fine-tuning improves CLIP's general image-text alignment capabilities too. All resources including the benchmark, the training data, and the finetuned model checkpoints will be released."
Poster,Vista: A Generalizable Driving World Model with High Fidelity and Versatile Controllability,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95003,"Shenyuan Gao, Jiazhi Yang, Li Chen, Kashyap Chitta, Yihang Qiu, Andreas Geiger, Jun Zhang, Hongyang Li","World models can foresee the outcomes of different actions, which is of paramount importance for autonomous driving. Nevertheless, existing driving world models still have limitations in generalization to unseen environments, prediction fidelity of critical details, and action controllability for flexible application. In this paper, we present Vista, a generalizable driving world model with high fidelity and versatile controllability. Based on a systematic diagnosis of existing methods, we introduce several key ingredients to address these limitations. To accurately predict real-world dynamics at high resolution, we propose two novel losses to promote the learning of moving instances and structural information. We also devise an effective latent replacement approach to inject historical frames as priors for coherent long-horizon rollouts. For action controllability, we incorporate a versatile set of controls from high-level intentions (command, goal point) to low-level maneuvers (trajectory, angle, and speed) through an efficient learning strategy. After large-scale training, the capabilities of Vista can seamlessly generalize to different scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that Vista outperforms the most advanced general-purpose video generator in over 70% of comparisons and surpasses the best-performing driving world model by 55% in FID and 27% in FVD. Moreover, for the first time, we utilize the capacity of Vista itself to establish a generalizable reward for real-world action evaluation without accessing the ground truth actions."
Poster,Visual Anchors Are Strong Information Aggregators For Multimodal Large Language Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96811,"Haogeng Liu, Quanzeng You, Xiaotian Han, Yongfei Liu, Huaibo Huang, Ran He, Hongxia Yang","In the realm of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), vision-language connector plays a crucial role to link the pre-trained vision encoders with Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its importance, the vision-language connector has been relatively less explored. In this study, we aim to propose a strong vision-language connector that enables MLLM to simultaneously achieve high accuracy and low computation cost. We first reveal the existence of the visual anchors in Vision Transformer and propose a cost-effective search algorithm to progressively extract them. Building on these findings, we introduce the Anchor Former (AcFormer), a novel vision-language connector designed to leverage the rich prior knowledge obtained from these visual anchors during pretraining, guiding the aggregation of information. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces computational costs by nearly two-thirds, while simultaneously outperforming baseline methods. This highlights the effectiveness and efficiency of AcFormer."
Poster,Visual Autoregressive Modeling: Scalable Image Generation via Next-Scale Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94115,"Keyu Tian, Yi Jiang, Zehuan Yuan, BINGYUE PENG, Liwei Wang","We present Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR), a new generation paradigm that redefines the autoregressive learning on images as coarse-to-fine ""next-scale prediction"" or ""next-resolution prediction"", diverging from the standard raster-scan ""next-token prediction"". This simple, intuitive methodology allows autoregressive (AR) transformers to learn visual distributions fast and generalize well: VAR, for the first time, makes GPT-style AR models surpass diffusion transformers in image generation. On ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VAR significantly improve AR baseline by improving Frechet inception distance (FID) from 18.65 to 1.73, inception score (IS) from 80.4 to 350.2, with around 20x faster inference speed. It is also empirically verified that VAR outperforms the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) in multiple dimensions including image quality, inference speed, data efficiency, and scalability. Scaling up VAR models exhibits clear power-law scaling laws similar to those observed in LLMs, with linear correlation coefficients near -0.998 as solid evidence. VAR further showcases zero-shot generalization ability in downstream tasks including image in-painting, out-painting, and editing. These results suggest VAR has initially emulated the two important properties of LLMs: Scaling Laws and zero-shot task generalization. We have released all models and codes to promote the exploration of AR/VAR models for visual generation and unified learning."
Poster,Visual CoT: Advancing Multi-Modal Language Models with a Comprehensive Dataset and Benchmark for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97623,"Hao Shao, Shengju Qian, Han Xiao, Guanglu Song, ZHUOFAN ZONG, Letian Wang, Yu Liu, Hongsheng Li","Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various VQA tasks. However, they often lack interpretability and struggle with complex visual inputs, especially when the resolution of the input image is high or when the interested region that could provide key information for answering the question is small. To address these challenges, we collect and introduce the large-scale Visual CoT dataset comprising 438k question-answer pairs, annotated with intermediate bounding boxes highlighting key regions essential for answering the questions. Additionally, about 98k pairs of them are annotated with detailed reasoning steps. Importantly, we propose a multi-turn processing pipeline that dynamically focuses on visual inputs and provides interpretable thoughts. We also introduce the related benchmark to evaluate the MLLMs in scenarios requiring specific local region identification.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and shed light on better inference strategies. The Visual CoT dataset, benchmark, and pre-trained models are available on this [website](https://hao-shao.com/projects/viscot.html) to support further research in this area."
Poster,Visual Data Diagnosis and Debiasing with Concept Graphs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94773,"Rwiddhi Chakraborty, Yinong  O Wang, Jialu Gao, Runkai Zheng, Cheng Zhang, Fernando D De la Torre","The widespread success of deep learning models today is owed to the curation of extensive datasets significant in size and complexity. However, such models frequently pick up inherent biases in the data during the training process, leading to unreliable predictions. Diagnosing and debiasing datasets is thus a necessity to ensure reliable model performance. In this paper, we present ConBias, a novel framework for diagnosing and mitigating Concept co-occurrence Biases in visual datasets. ConBias represents visual datasets as knowledge graphs of concepts, enabling meticulous analysis of spurious concept co-occurrences to uncover concept imbalances across the whole dataset. Moreover, we show that by employing a novel clique-based concept balancing strategy, we can mitigate these imbalances, leading to enhanced performance on downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that data augmentation based on a balanced concept distribution augmented by ConBias improves generalization performance across multiple datasets compared to state-of-the-art methods."
