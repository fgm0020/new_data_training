Poster,Label Noise: Ignorance Is Bliss,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94205,"Yilun Zhu, Jianxin Zhang, Aditya Gangrade, Clay Scott","We establish a new theoretical framework for learning under multi-class, instance-dependent label noise.     This framework casts learning with label    noise as a form of domain adaptation, in particular, domain adaptation    under posterior drift.     We introduce the concept of \emph{relative signal strength} (RSS), a pointwise measure that quantifies the transferability from noisy to clean posterior.     Using RSS, we establish nearly matching upper and lower bounds on the excess risk.     Our theoretical findings support     the simple    \emph{Noise Ignorant Empirical Risk Minimization (NI-ERM)} principle,    which minimizes empirical risk while ignoring label noise.    Finally, we translate this theoretical insight into practice: by    using NI-ERM to fit a linear classifier on top of a self-supervised    feature extractor, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the    CIFAR-N data challenge."
Poster,LACIE: Listener-Aware Finetuning for Calibration in Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95152,"Elias Stengel-Eskin, Peter Hase, Mohit Bansal","When answering questions, large language models (LLMs) can convey not only an answer to the question, but a level of confidence about the answer being correct. This includes explicit markers of confidence (e.g. giving a numeric confidence score) as well as implicit markers, like using an authoritative tone or elaborating with additional knowledge of a subject. For LLMs to be trustworthy sources of knowledge, the confidence they convey should match their actual expertise on a topic; however, this is currently not the case, with most models tending towards overconfidence. To calibrate both implicit and explicit confidence markers, we introduce a pragmatic, listener-aware finetuning method (LACIE) that directly models the listener, considering not only whether an answer is right, but whether it will be accepted by a listener. Specifically, we cast calibration as a preference optimization problem, creating data via a two-agent speaker-listener game, where a speaker model’s outputs are judged by a simulated listener. We then finetune three different LLMs (Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B, Llama3-70B) with LACIE, and show that the models resulting from this multi-agent optimization are better calibrated on TriviaQA with respect to a simulated listener. Crucially, these trends transfer to human listeners, helping them correctly predict model correctness: we conduct a human evaluation where annotators accept or reject an LLM’s answers to trivia questions, finding that training with LACIE results in 47% fewer incorrect answers being accepted while maintaining the same level of acceptance for correct answers. Furthermore, LACIE generalizes to another dataset, resulting in a large increase in truthfulness on TruthfulQA when trained on TriviaQA. Our analysis indicates that LACIE leads to a better separation in confidence between correct and incorrect examples. Qualitatively, we find that a LACIE-trained model hedges more when uncertain and adopts implicit cues to signal certainty when it is correct, such as using an authoritative tone or including details. Finally, finetuning with our listener- aware method leads to an emergent increase in model abstention (e.g. saying “I don’t know”) for answers that are likely to be wrong, trading recall for precision."
Poster,LaKD: Length-agnostic Knowledge Distillation for Trajectory Prediction with Any Length Observations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94223,"Yuhang Li, Changsheng Li, Ruilin Lv, Rongqing Li, Ye Yuan, Guoren Wang","Trajectory prediction is a crucial technology to help systems avoid traffic accidents, ensuring safe autonomous driving. Previous methods typically use a fixed-length and sufficiently long trajectory of an agent as observations to predict its future trajectory. However, in real-world scenarios, we often lack the time to gather enough trajectory points before making predictions, e.g., when a car suddenly appears due to an obstruction, the system must make immediate predictions to prevent a collision. This poses a new challenge for trajectory prediction systems, requiring them to be capable of making accurate predictions based on observed trajectories of arbitrary lengths, leading to the failure of existing methods. In this paper, we propose a Length-agnostic Knowledge Distillation framework, named LaKD,  which can make accurate trajectory predictions, regardless of the length of observed data. Specifically, considering the fact that long trajectories, containing richer temporal information but potentially additional interference, may perform better or worse than short trajectories, we devise a dynamic length-agnostic knowledge distillation mechanism for exchanging information among trajectories of arbitrary lengths, dynamically determining the transfer direction based on prediction performance. In contrast to traditional knowledge distillation, LaKD employs a unique model that simultaneously serves as both the teacher and the student, potentially causing knowledge collision during the distillation process. Therefore, we design a dynamic soft-masking mechanism, where we first calculate the importance of neuron units and then apply soft-masking to them, so as to safeguard critical units from disruption during the knowledge distillation process. In essence, LaKD is a general and principled framework that can be naturally compatible with existing trajectory prediction models of different architectures. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, Argoverse 1, nuScenes and Argoverse 2, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."
Poster,LAM3D: Large Image-Point Clouds Alignment Model for 3D Reconstruction from Single Image,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96420,"Ruikai Cui, Xibin Song, Weixuan Sun, Senbo Wang, Weizhe Liu, Shenzhou Chen, Taizhang Shang, YANG LI, Nick Barnes, Hongdong Li, Pan Ji","Large Reconstruction Models have made significant strides in the realm of automated 3D content generation from single or multiple input images. Despite their success, these models often produce 3D meshes with geometric inaccuracies, stemming from the inherent challenges of deducing 3D shapes solely from image data. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, the Large Image and Point Cloud Alignment Model (LAM3D), which utilizes 3D point cloud data to enhance the fidelity of generated 3D meshes. Our methodology begins with the development of a point-cloud-based network that effectively generates precise and meaningful latent tri-planes, laying the groundwork for accurate 3D mesh reconstruction. Building upon this, our Image-Point-Cloud Feature Alignment technique processes a single input image, aligning to the latent tri-planes to imbue image features with robust 3D information. This process not only enriches the image features but also facilitates the production of high-fidelity 3D meshes without the need for multi-view input, significantly reducing geometric distortions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art high-fidelity 3D mesh reconstruction from a single image in just 6 seconds, and experiments on various datasets demonstrate its effectiveness."
Poster,Lambda: Learning Matchable Prior For Entity Alignment with Unlabeled Dangling Cases,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96250,"Hang Yin, Liyao Xiang, Dong Ding, Yuheng He, Yihan Wu, Pengzhi Chu, Xinbing Wang, Chenghu Zhou","We investigate the entity alignment (EA) problem with unlabeled dangling cases, meaning that partial entities have no counterparts in the other knowledge graph (KG), yet these entities are unlabeled. The problem arises when the source and target graphs are of different scales, and it is much cheaper to label the matchable pairs than the dangling entities. To address this challenge, we propose the framework \textit{Lambda} for dangling detection and entity alignment. Lambda features a GNN-based encoder called KEESA with a spectral contrastive learning loss for EA and a positive-unlabeled learning algorithm called iPULE for dangling detection. Our dangling detection module offers theoretical guarantees of unbiasedness, uniform deviation bounds, and convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that each component contributes to overall performances that are superior to baselines, even when baselines additionally exploit 30\% of dangling entities labeled for training."
Poster,Langevin Unlearning: A New Perspective of Noisy Gradient Descent for Machine Unlearning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96754,"Eli Chien, Haoyu Wang, Ziang Chen, Pan Li","Machine unlearning has raised significant interest with the adoption of laws ensuring the ``right to be forgotten''. Researchers have provided a probabilistic notion of approximate unlearning under a similar definition of Differential Privacy (DP), where privacy is defined as statistical indistinguishability to retraining from scratch. We propose Langevin unlearning, an unlearning framework based on noisy gradient descent with privacy guarantees for approximate unlearning problems. Langevin unlearning unifies the DP learning process and the privacy-certified unlearning process with many algorithmic benefits. These include approximate certified unlearning for non-convex problems, complexity saving compared to retraining, sequential and batch unlearning for multiple unlearning requests."
Poster,Language-Driven Interactive Traffic Trajectory Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96845,"Junkai XIA, Chenxin Xu, Qingyao Xu, Yanfeng Wang, Siheng Chen","Realistic trajectory generation with natural language control is pivotal for advancing autonomous vehicle technology. However, previous methods focus on individual traffic participant trajectory generation, thus failing to account for the complexity of interactive traffic dynamics. In this work, we propose InteractTraj, the first language-driven traffic trajectory generator that can generate interactive traffic trajectories. InteractTraj interprets abstract trajectory descriptions into concrete formatted interaction-aware numerical codes and learns a mapping between these formatted codes and the final interactive trajectories. To interpret language descriptions, we propose a language-to-code encoder with a novel interaction-aware encoding strategy. To produce interactive traffic trajectories, we propose a code-to-trajectory decoder with interaction-aware feature aggregation that synergizes vehicle interactions with the environmental map and the vehicle moves. Extensive experiments show our method demonstrates superior performance over previous SoTA methods, offering a more realistic generation of interactive traffic trajectories with high controllability via diverse natural language commands."
Poster,Language Generation in the Limit,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95986,"Jon Kleinberg, Sendhil Mullainathan","Although current large language models are complex, the most basic specifications of the underlying language generation problem itself are simple to state: given a finite set of training samples from an unknown language, produce valid new strings from the language that don't already appear in the training data. Here we ask what we can conclude about language generation using only this specification, without further assumptions. In particular, suppose that an adversary enumerates the strings of an unknown target language L that is known only to come from one of a possibly infinite list of candidates. A computational agent is trying to learn to generate from this language; we say that the agent generates from $L$ in the limit if after some finite point in the enumeration of $L$, the agent is able to produce new elements that come exclusively from $L$ and that have not yet been presented by the adversary. Our main result is that there is an agent that is able to generate in the limit for every countable list of candidate languages. This contrasts dramatically with negative results due to Gold and Angluin in a well-studied model of language learning where the goal is to identify an unknown language from samples; the difference between these results suggests that identifying a language is a fundamentally different problem than generating from it."
Poster,Language Grounded Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning with Human-interpretable Communication,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96086,"Huao Li, Hossein Nourkhiz Mahjoub, Behdad Chalaki, Vaishnav Tadiparthi, Kwonjoon Lee, Ehsan Moradi Pari, Charles Lewis, Katia Sycara","Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods have shown promise in enabling agents to learn a shared communication protocol from scratch and accomplish challenging team tasks. However, the learned language is usually not interpretable to humans or other agents not co-trained together, limiting its applicability in ad-hoc teamwork scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel computational pipeline that aligns the communication space between MARL agents with an embedding space of human natural language by grounding agent communications on synthetic data generated by embodied Large Language Models (LLMs) in interactive teamwork scenarios. Our results demonstrate that introducing language grounding not only maintains task performance but also accelerates the emergence of communication. Furthermore, the learned communication protocols exhibit zero-shot generalization capabilities in ad-hoc teamwork scenarios with unseen teammates and novel task states. This work presents a significant step toward enabling effective communication and collaboration between artificial agents and humans in real-world teamwork settings."
Poster,Language Model as Visual Explainer,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96068,"Xingyi Yang, Xinchao Wang","In this paper, we present Language Model as Visual Explainer (\texttt{LVX}), a systematic approach for interpreting the internal workings of vision models using a tree-structured linguistic explanation, without the need for model training. Central to our strategy is the collaboration between vision models and LLM to craft explanations. On one hand,  the LLM is harnessed to delineate hierarchical visual attributes, while concurrently,  a text-to-image API retrieves  images that are most aligned with these textual concepts. By mapping the collected texts and images  to the vision model's embedding space,  we construct a hierarchy-structured visual embedding tree. This tree is dynamically pruned and grown by querying the LLM using language templates, tailoring the explanation to the model.  Such a scheme allows us to seamlessly incorporate new attributes while eliminating undesired concepts based on the model's representations. When applied to testing samples, our method provides human-understandable explanations in the form of attribute-laden trees. Beyond explanation, we retrained the vision model by calibrating it on the generated concept hierarchy, allowing the model to incorporate the refined knowledge of visual attributes. To access the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce new benchmarks and conduct rigorous evaluations, demonstrating its plausibility, faithfulness, and stability."
