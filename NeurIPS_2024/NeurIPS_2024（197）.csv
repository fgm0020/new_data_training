Poster,Improved off-policy training of diffusion samplers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93194,"Marcin Sendera, Minsu Kim, Sarthak Mittal, Pablo Lemos, Luca Scimeca, Jarrid Rector-Brooks, Alexandre Adam, Yoshua Bengio, Nikolay Malkin","We study the problem of training diffusion models to sample from a distribution with a given unnormalized density or energy function. We benchmark several diffusion-structured inference methods, including simulation-based variational approaches and off-policy methods (continuous generative flow networks). Our results shed light on the relative advantages of existing algorithms while bringing into question some claims from past work. We also propose a novel exploration strategy for off-policy methods, based on local search in the target space with the use of a replay buffer, and show that it improves the quality of samples on a variety of target distributions. Our code for the sampling methods and benchmarks studied is made public at [this link](https://github.com/GFNOrg/gfn-diffusion) as a base for future work on diffusion models for amortized inference."
Poster,Improved Particle Approximation Error for Mean Field Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96483,Atsushi Nitanda,"Mean-field Langevin dynamics (MFLD) minimizes an entropy-regularized nonlinear convex functional defined over the space of probability distributions. MFLD has gained attention due to its connection with noisy gradient descent for mean-field two-layer neural networks. Unlike standard Langevin dynamics, the nonlinearity of the objective functional induces particle interactions, necessitating multiple particles to approximate the dynamics in a finite-particle setting. Recent works (Chen et al., 2022; Suzuki et al., 2023b) have demonstrated the uniform-in-time propagation of chaos for MFLD, showing that the gap between the particle system and its mean-field limit uniformly shrinks over time as the number of particles increases. In this work, we improve the dependence on logarithmic Sobolev inequality (LSI) constants in their particle approximation errors, which can exponentially deteriorate with the regularization coefficient. Specifically, we establish an LSI-constant-free particle approximation error concerning the objective gap by leveraging the problem structure in risk minimization. As the application, we demonstrate improved convergence of MFLD, sampling guarantee for the mean-field stationary distribution, and uniform-in-time Wasserstein propagation of chaos in terms of particle complexity."
Poster,Improved Regret for Bandit Convex Optimization with Delayed Feedback,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94556,"Yuanyu Wan, Chang Yao, Mingli Song, Lijun Zhang","We investigate bandit convex optimization (BCO) with delayed feedback, where only the loss value of the action is revealed under an arbitrary delay. Let $n,T,\bar{d}$ denote the dimensionality, time horizon, and average delay, respectively. Previous studies have achieved an $O(\sqrt{n}T^{3/4}+(n\bar{d})^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ regret bound for this problem, whose delay-independent part matches the regret of the classical non-delayed bandit gradient descent algorithm. However, there is a large gap between its delay-dependent part, i.e., $O((n\bar{d})^{1/3}T^{2/3})$, and an existing $\Omega(\sqrt{\bar{d}T})$ lower bound. In this paper, we illustrate that this gap can be filled in the worst case, where $\bar{d}$ is very close to the maximum delay $d$. Specifically, we first develop a novel algorithm, and prove that it enjoys a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{n}T^{3/4}+\sqrt{dT})$ in general. Compared with the previous result, our regret bound is better for $d=O((n\bar{d})^{2/3}T^{1/3})$, and the delay-dependent part is tight in the worst case. The primary idea is to decouple the joint effect of the delays and the bandit feedback on the regret by carefully incorporating the delayed bandit feedback with a blocking update mechanism. Furthermore, we show that the proposed algorithm can improve the regret bound to $O((nT)^{2/3}\log^{1/3}T+d\log T)$ for strongly convex functions. Finally, if the action sets are unconstrained, we demonstrate that it can be simply extended to achieve an $O(n\sqrt{T\log T}+d\log T)$ regret bound for strongly convex and smooth functions."
Poster,Improved Regret of Linear Ensemble Sampling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96524,"Harin Lee, Min-hwan Oh","In this work, we close the fundamental gap of theory and practice by providing an improved regret bound for linear ensemble sampling. We prove that with an ensemble size logarithmic in $T$, linear ensemble sampling can achieve a frequentist regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$, matching state-of-the-art results for randomized linear bandit algorithms, where $d$ and $T$ are the dimension of the parameter and the time horizon respectively. Our approach introduces a general regret analysis framework for linear bandit algorithms. Additionally, we reveal a significant relationship between linear ensemble sampling and Linear Perturbed-History Exploration (LinPHE), showing that LinPHE is a special case of linear ensemble sampling when the ensemble size equals $T$. This insight allows us to derive a new regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ for LinPHE, independent of the number of arms. Our contributions advance the theoretical foundation of ensemble sampling, bringing its regret bounds in line with the best known bounds for other randomized exploration algorithms."
Poster,Improved Sample Complexity Bounds for Diffusion Model Training,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95337,"Shivam Gupta, Aditya Parulekar, Eric Price, Zhiyang Xun","Diffusion models have become the most popular approach to deep generative modeling of images, largely due to their empirical performance and reliability. From a theoretical standpoint, a number of recent works [CCL+23, CCSW22, BBDD24] have studied the iteration complexity of sampling, assuming access to an accurate diffusion model. In this work, we focus on understanding the *sample complexity* of training such a model; how many samples are needed to learn an accurate diffusion model using a sufficiently expressive neural network? Prior work [BMR20] showed bounds polynomial in the dimension, desired Total Variation error, and Wasserstein error. We show an *exponential improvement* in the dependence on Wasserstein error and depth, along with improved dependencies on other relevant parameters."
Poster,Improved Sample Complexity for Multiclass PAC Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93856,"Steve Hanneke, Shay Moran, Qian Zhang","We aim to understand the optimal PAC sample complexity in multiclass learning. While finiteness of the Daniely-Shalev-Shwartz (DS) dimension has been shown to characterize the PAC learnability of a concept class [Brukhim, Carmon, Dinur, Moran, and Yehudayoff, 2022], there exist polylog factor gaps in the leading term of the sample complexity. In this paper, we reduce the gap in terms of the dependence on the error parameter to a single log factor and also propose two possible routes towards completely resolving the optimal sample complexity, each based on a key open question we formulate: one concerning list learning with bounded list size, the other concerning a new type of shifting for multiclass concept classes. We prove that a positive answer to either of the two questions would completely resolve the optimal sample complexity up to log factors of the DS dimension."
Poster,Improving Adaptivity via Over-Parameterization in Sequence Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94952,"Yicheng Li, Qian Lin","It is well known that eigenfunctions of a kernel play a crucial role in kernel regression.    Through several examples, we demonstrate that even with the same set of eigenfunctions, the order of these functions significantly impacts regression outcomes.    Simplifying the model by diagonalizing the kernel, we introduce an over-parameterized gradient descent in the realm of sequence model to capture the effects of various orders of a fixed set of eigen-functions.    This method is designed to explore the impact of varying eigenfunction orders.    Our theoretical results show that the over-parameterization gradient flow can adapt to the underlying structure of the signal and significantly outperform the vanilla gradient flow method.    Moreover, we also demonstrate that deeper over-parameterization can further enhance the generalization capability of the model.    These results not only provide a new perspective on the benefits of over-parameterization and but also offer insights into the adaptivity and generalization potential of neural networks beyond the kernel regime."
Poster,Improving Adversarial Robust Fairness via Anti-Bias Soft Label  Distillation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93884,"Shiji Zhao, Ranjie Duan, xizhewang, Xingxing Wei","Adversarial Training (AT) has been widely proved to be an effective method to improve the adversarial robustness against adversarial examples for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). As a variant of AT, Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) has demonstrated its superior performance in improving the robustness of small student models with the guidance of large teacher models. However, both AT and ARD encounter the robust fairness problem: these models exhibit strong robustness when facing part of classes (easy class), but weak robustness when facing others (hard class). In this paper, we give an in-depth analysis of the potential factors and argue that the smoothness degree of samples' soft labels for different classes (i.e., hard class or easy class) will affect the robust fairness of DNNs from both empirical observation and theoretical analysis. Based on the above finding, we propose an Anti-Bias Soft Label Distillation (ABSLD) method to mitigate the adversarial robust fairness problem within the framework of Knowledge Distillation (KD). Specifically, ABSLD adaptively reduces the student's error risk gap between different classes to achieve fairness by adjusting the class-wise smoothness degree of samples' soft labels during the training process, and the smoothness degree of soft labels is controlled by assigning different temperatures in KD to different classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ABSLD outperforms state-of-the-art AT, ARD, and robust fairness methods in the comprehensive metric (Normalized Standard Deviation) of robustness and fairness."
Poster,Improving Alignment and Robustness with Circuit Breakers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95761,"Andy Zou, Long Phan, Justin Wang, Derek Duenas, Maxwell Lin, Maksym Andriushchenko, J. Zico Kolter, Matt Fredrikson, Dan Hendrycks","AI systems can take harmful actions and are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. We present an approach, inspired by recent advances in representation engineering, that interrupts the models as they respond with harmful outputs with ""circuit breakers."" Existing techniques aimed at improving alignment, such as refusal training, are often bypassed. Techniques such as adversarial training try to plug these holes by countering specific attacks. As an alternative to refusal training and adversarial training, circuit-breaking directly controls the representations that are responsible for harmful outputs in the first place. Our technique can be applied to both text-only and multimodal language models to prevent the generation of harmful outputs without sacrificing utility -- even in the presence of powerful unseen attacks. Notably, while adversarial robustness in standalone image recognition remains an open challenge, circuit breakers allow the larger multimodal system to reliably withstand image ""hijacks"" that aim to produce harmful content. Finally, we extend our approach to AI agents, demonstrating considerable reductions in the rate of harmful actions when they are under attack. Our approach represents a significant step forward in the development of reliable safeguards to harmful behavior and adversarial attacks."
Poster,Improving Context-Aware Preference Modeling for Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96617,"Silviu Pitis, Ziang Xiao, Nicolas Le Roux, Alessandro Sordoni","While finetuning language models from pairwise preferences has proven remarkably effective, the underspecified nature of natural language presents critical challenges. Direct preference feedback is uninterpretable, difficult to provide where multidimensional criteria may apply, and often inconsistent, either because it is based on incomplete instructions or provided by diverse principals. To address these challenges, we consider the two-step preference modeling procedure that first resolves the under-specification by selecting a context, and then evaluates preference with respect to the chosen context. We decompose reward modeling error according to these two steps, which suggests that supervising context in addition to context-specific preference may be a viable approach to aligning models with diverse human preferences. For this to work, the ability of models to evaluate context-specific preference is critical. To this end, we contribute context-conditioned preference datasets and accompanying experiments that investigate the ability of language models to evaluate context-specific preference. Unlike past datasets, where context-specific preference is highly correlated with general preference, our ""preference reversal"" datasets disentangle context-specific and general preferences to isolate context-specific capabilities. We use our datasets to (1) show that existing preference models benefit from, but fail to fully consider, added context, (2) finetune a context-aware reward model with context-specific performance exceeding that of GPT-4 and Llama 3 70B, and (3) investigate the potential value of context-aware preference modeling."
