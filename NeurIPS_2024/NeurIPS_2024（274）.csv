Poster,Neural Flow Diffusion Models: Learnable Forward Process for Improved Diffusion Modelling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94656,"Grigory Bartosh, Dmitry Vetrov, Christian Andersson Naesseth","Conventional diffusion models typically relies on a fixed forward process, which implicitly defines complex marginal distributions over latent variables. This can often complicate the reverse process’ task in learning generative trajectories, and results in costly inference for diffusion models. To address these limitations, we introduce Neural Flow Diffusion Models (NFDM), a novel framework that enhances diffusion models by supporting a broader range of forward processes beyond the standard Gaussian. We also propose a novel parameterization technique for learning the forward process. Our framework provides an end-to-end, simulation-free optimization objective, effectively minimizing a variational upper bound on the negative log-likelihood. Experimental results demonstrate NFDM’s strong performance, evidenced by state-of-the-art likelihood estimation. Furthermore, we investigate NFDM’s capacity for learning generative dynamics with specific characteristics, such as deterministic straight lines trajectories, and demonstrate how the framework may be adopted for learning bridges between two distributions. The results underscores NFDM’s versatility and its potential for a wide range of applications."
Poster,NeuralFluid: Nueral Fluidic System Design and Control with Differentiable Simulation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95600,"Yifei Li, Yuchen Sun, Pingchuan Ma, Eftychios Sifakis, Tao Du, Bo Zhu, Wojciech Matusik","We present NeuralFluid, a novel framework to explore neural control and design of complex fluidic systems with dynamic solid boundaries. Our system features a fast differentiable Navier-Stokes solver with solid-fluid interface handling, a low-dimensional differentiable parametric geometry representation, a control-shape co-design algorithm, and gym-like simulation environments to facilitate various fluidic control design applications. Additionally, we present a benchmark of design, control, and learning tasks on high-fidelity, high-resolution dynamic fluid environments that pose challenges for existing differentiable fluid simulators. These tasks include designing the control of artificial hearts, identifying robotic end-effector shapes, and controlling a fluid gate. By seamlessly incorporating our differentiable fluid simulator into a learning framework, we demonstrate successful design, control, and learning results that surpass gradient-free solutions in these benchmark tasks."
Poster,NeuralFuse: Learning to Recover the Accuracy of Access-Limited Neural Network Inference in Low-Voltage Regimes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93664,"Hao-Lun Sun, Lei Hsiung, Nandhini Chandramoorthy, Pin-Yu Chen, Tsung-Yi Ho","Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become ubiquitous in machine learning, but their energy consumption remains problematically high. An effective strategy for reducing such consumption is supply-voltage reduction, but if done too aggressively, it can lead to accuracy degradation. This is due to random bit-flips in static random access memory (SRAM), where model parameters are stored. To address this challenge, we have developed NeuralFuse, a novel add-on module that handles the energy-accuracy tradeoff in low-voltage regimes by learning input transformations and using them to generate error-resistant data representations, thereby protecting DNN accuracy in both nominal and low-voltage scenarios. As well as being easy to implement, NeuralFuse can be readily applied to DNNs with limited access, such cloud-based APIs that are accessed remotely or non-configurable hardware. Our experimental results demonstrate that, at a 1% bit-error rate, NeuralFuse can reduce SRAM access energy by up to 24% while recovering accuracy by up to 57%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to addressing low-voltage-induced bit errors that requires no model retraining."
Poster,Neural Gaffer: Relighting Any Object via Diffusion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92953,"Haian Jin, Yuan Li, Fujun Luan, Yuanbo Xiangli, Sai Bi, Kai Zhang, Zexiang Xu, Jin Sun, Noah Snavely","Single-image relighting is a challenging task that involves reasoning about the complex interplay between geometry, materials, and lighting. Many prior methods either support only specific categories of images, such as portraits, or require special capture conditions, like using a flashlight. Alternatively, some methods explicitly decompose a scene into intrinsic components, such as normals and BRDFs, which can be inaccurate or under-expressive. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end 2D relighting diffusion model, called Neural Gaffer, that takes a single image of any object and can synthesize an accurate, high-quality relit image under any novel environmental lighting condition, simply by conditioning an image generator on a target environment map, without an explicit scene decomposition. Our method builds on a pre-trained diffusion model, and fine-tunes it on a synthetic relighting dataset, revealing and harnessing the inherent understanding of lighting present in the diffusion model. We evaluate our model on both synthetic and in-the-wild Internet imagery and demonstrate its advantages in terms of generalization and accuracy. Moreover, by combining with other generative methods, our model enables many downstream 2D tasks, such as text-based relighting and object insertion. Our model can also operate as a strong relighting prior for 3D tasks, such as relighting a radiance field."
Poster,Neural Isometries: Taming Transformations for Equivariant ML,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93912,"Thomas Mitchel, Michael Taylor, Vincent Sitzmann","Real-world geometry and 3D vision tasks are replete with challenging symmetries that defy tractable analytical expression. In this paper, we introduce Neural Isometries, an autoencoder framework which learns to map the observation space to a general-purpose latent space wherein encodings are related by isometries whenever their corresponding observations are geometrically related in world space. Specifically, we regularize the latent space such that maps between encodings preserve a learned inner product and commute with a learned functional operator, in the same manner as rigid-body transformations commute with the Laplacian. This approach forms an effective backbone for self-supervised representation learning, and we demonstrate that a simple off-the-shelf equivariant network operating in the pre-trained latent space can achieve results on par with meticulously-engineered, handcrafted networks designed to handle complex, nonlinear symmetries. Furthermore, isometric maps capture information about the respective transformations in world space, and we show that this allows us to regress camera poses directly from the coefficients of the maps between encodings of adjacent views of a scene."
Poster,Neural Krylov Iteration for Accelerating Linear System Solving,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94379,"Jian Luo, Jie Wang, Hong Wang, huanshuo dong, Zijie Geng, Hanzhu Chen, Yufei Kuang","Solving large-scale sparse linear systems is essential in fields like mathematics, science, and engineering. Traditional numerical solvers, mainly based on the Krylov subspace iteration algorithm, suffer from the low-efficiency problem, which primarily arises from the less-than-ideal iteration. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel method, namely **Neur**al **K**rylov **It**era**t**ion (**NeurKItt**), for accelerating linear system solving.Specifically, NeurKItt employs a neural operator to predict the invariant subspace of the linear system and then leverages the predicted subspace to accelerate linear system solving. To enhance the subspace prediction accuracy, we utilize QR decomposition for the neural operator outputs and introduce a novel projection loss function for training. NeurKItt benefits the solving by using the predicted subspace to guide the iteration process, significantly reducing the number of iterations.We provide extensive experiments and comprehensive theoretical analyses to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of NeurKItt. In our main experiments, NeurKItt accelerates the solving of linear systems across various settings and datasets, achieving up to a 5.5× speedup in computation time and a 16.1× speedup in the number of iterations."
Poster,Neural Localizer Fields for Continuous 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95149,"István Sárándi, Gerard Pons-Moll","With the explosive growth of available training data, single-image 3D human modeling is ahead of a transition to a data-centric paradigm.A key to successfully exploiting data scale is to design flexible models that can be supervised from various heterogeneous data sources produced by different researchers or vendors.To this end, we propose a simple yet powerful paradigm for seamlessly unifying different human pose and shape-related tasks and datasets.Our formulation is centered on the ability - both at training and test time - to query any arbitrary point of the human volume, and obtain its estimated location in 3D.We achieve this by learning a continuous neural field of body point localizer functions, each of which is a differently parameterized 3D heatmap-based convolutional point localizer (detector).For generating parametric output, we propose an efficient post-processing step for fitting SMPL-family body models to nonparametric joint and vertex predictions.With this approach, we can naturally exploit differently annotated data sources including mesh, 2D/3D skeleton and dense pose, without having to convert between them, and thereby train large-scale 3D human mesh and skeleton estimation models that outperform the state-of-the-art on several public benchmarks including 3DPW, EMDB, EHF, SSP-3D and AGORA by a considerable margin.We release our code and models to foster downstream research."
Poster,Neural Model Checking,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94345,"Mirco Giacobbe, Daniel Kroening, Abhinandan Pal, Michael Tautschnig","We introduce a machine learning approach to model checking temporal logic, with application to formal hardware verification. Model checking answers the question of whether every execution of a given system satisfies a desired temporal logic specification. Unlike testing, model checking provides formal guarantees. Its application is expected standard in silicon design and the EDA industry has invested decades into the development of performant symbolic model checking algorithms. Our new approach combines machine learning and symbolic reasoning by using neural networks as formal proof certificates for linear temporal logic. We train our neural certificates from randomly generated executions of the system and we then symbolically check their validity using satisfiability solving which, upon the affirmative answer, establishes that the system provably satisfies the specification. We leverage the expressive power of neural networks to represent proof certificates as well as the fact that checking a certificate is much simpler than finding one. As a result, our machine learning procedure for model checking is entirely unsupervised, formally sound, and practically effective. We experimentally demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art academic and commercial model checkers on a set of standard hardware designs written in SystemVerilog."
Poster,Neural network learns low-dimensional polynomials with SGD near the information-theoretic limit,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93503,"Jason Lee, Kazusato Oko, Taiji Suzuki, Denny Wu","We study the problem of gradient descent learning of a single-index target function $f_*(\boldsymbol{x}) = \textstyle\sigma_*\left(\langle\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{\theta}\rangle\right)$ under isotropic Gaussian data in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where the unknown link function $\sigma_*:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ has information exponent $p$ (defined as the lowest degree in the Hermite expansion). Prior works showed that gradient-based training of neural networks can learn this target with $n\gtrsim d^{\Theta(p)}$ samples, and such complexity is predicted to be necessary by the correlational statistical query lower bound. Surprisingly, we prove that a two-layer neural network optimized by an SGD-based algorithm (on the squared loss) learns $f_*$ with a complexity that is not governed by the information exponent. Specifically, for arbitrary polynomial single-index models, we establish a sample and runtime complexity of $n \simeq T = \Theta(d\cdot\mathrm{polylog} d)$, where $\Theta(\cdot)$ hides a constant only depending on the degree of $\sigma_*$; this dimension dependence matches the information theoretic limit up to polylogarithmic factors. More generally, we show that $n\gtrsim d^{(p_*-1)\vee 1}$ samples are sufficient to achieve low generalization error, where $p_* \le p$ is the \textit{generative exponent} of the link function. Core to our analysis is the reuse of minibatch in the gradient computation, which gives rise to higher-order information beyond correlational queries."
Poster,Neural Network Reparametrization for Accelerated Optimization in Molecular Simulations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95938,"Nima Dehmamy, Csaba Both, Jeet Mohapatra, Subhro Das, Tommi Jaakkola","We propose a novel approach to molecular simulations using neural network reparametrization, which offers a flexible alternative to traditional coarse-graining methods. Unlike conventional techniques that strictly reduce degrees of freedom, the complexity of the system can be adjusted in our model, sometimes increasing it to simplify the optimization process. Our approach also maintains continuous access to fine-grained modes and eliminates the need for force-matching, enhancing both the efficiency and accuracy of energy minimization.Importantly, our framework allows for the use of potentially arbitrary neural networks (e.g., Graph Neural Networks (GNN)) to perform the reparametrization, incorporating CG modes as needed. In fact, our experiments using very weak molecular forces (Lennard-Jones potential) the GNN-based model is the sole model to find the correct configuration. Similarly, in protein-folding scenarios, our GNN-based CG method consistently outperforms traditional optimization methods. It not only recovers the target structures more accurately but also achieves faster convergence to the deepest energy states.This work demonstrates significant advancements in molecular simulations by optimizing energy minimization and convergence speeds, offering a new, efficient framework for simulating complex molecular systems."
