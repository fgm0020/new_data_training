Poster,R$^2$-Gaussian: Rectifying Radiative Gaussian Splatting for Tomographic Reconstruction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94214,"Ruyi Zha, Tao Jun Lin, Yuanhao Cai, Jiwen Cao, Yanhao Zhang, Hongdong Li","3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has shown promising results in image rendering and surface reconstruction. However, its potential in volumetric reconstruction tasks, such as X-ray computed tomography, remains under-explored. This paper introduces R$^2$-Gaussian, the first 3DGS-based framework for sparse-view tomographic reconstruction. By carefully deriving X-ray rasterization functions, we discover a previously unknown \emph{integration bias} in the standard 3DGS formulation, which hampers accurate volume retrieval. To address this issue, we propose a novel rectification technique via refactoring the projection from 3D to 2D Gaussians. Our new method presents three key innovations: (1) introducing tailored Gaussian kernels, (2) extending rasterization to X-ray imaging, and (3) developing a CUDA-based differentiable voxelizer. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy and efficiency. Crucially, it delivers high-quality results in 4 minutes, which is 12$\times$ faster than NeRF-based methods and on par with traditional algorithms."
Poster,RadarOcc: Robust 3D Occupancy Prediction with 4D Imaging Radar,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96791,"Fangqiang Ding, Xiangyu Wen, Yunzhou Zhu, Yiming Li, Chris Xiaoxuan Lu","3D occupancy-based perception pipeline has significantly advanced autonomous driving by capturing detailed scene descriptions and demonstrating strong generalizability across various object categories and shapes. Current methods predominantly rely on LiDAR or camera inputs for 3D occupancy prediction. These methods are susceptible to adverse weather conditions, limiting the all-weather deployment of self-driving cars. To improve perception robustness, we leverage the recent advances in automotive radars and introduce a novel approach that utilizes 4D imaging radar sensors for 3D occupancy prediction. Our method, RadarOcc, circumvents the limitations of sparse radar point clouds by directly processing the 4D radar tensor, thus preserving essential scene details. RadarOcc innovatively addresses the challenges associated with the voluminous and noisy 4D radar data by employing Doppler bins descriptors, sidelobe-aware spatial sparsification, and range-wise self-attention mechanisms. To minimize the interpolation errors associated with direct coordinate transformations, we also devise a spherical-based feature encoding followed by spherical-to-Cartesian feature aggregation. We benchmark various baseline methods based on distinct modalities on the public K-Radar dataset. The results demonstrate RadarOcc's state-of-the-art performance in radar-based 3D occupancy prediction and promising results even when compared with LiDAR- or camera-based methods. Additionally, we present qualitative evidence of the superior performance of 4D radar in adverse weather conditions and explore the impact of key pipeline components through ablation studies."
Poster,Rad-NeRF: Ray-decoupled Training of Neural Radiance Field,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93705,"Lidong Guo, Xuefei Ning, Yonggan Fu, Tianchen Zhao, Zhuoliang Kang, Jincheng Yu, Yingyan (Celine) Lin, Yu Wang","Although the neural radiance field (NeRF) exhibits high-fidelity visualization on the rendering task, it still suffers from rendering defects, especially in complex scenes. In this paper, we delve into the reason for the unsatisfactory performance and conjecture that it comes from interference in the training process. Due to occlusions in complex scenes, a 3D point may be invisible to some rays. On such a point, training with those rays that do not contain valid information about the point might interfere with the NeRF training. Based on the above intuition, we decouple the training process of NeRF in the ray dimension softly and propose a Ray-decoupled Training Framework for neural rendering (Rad-NeRF). Specifically, we construct an ensemble of sub-NeRFs and train a soft gate module to assign the gating scores to these sub-NeRFs based on specific rays. The gate module is jointly optimized with the sub-NeRF ensemble to learn the preference of sub-NeRFs for different rays automatically. Furthermore, we introduce depth-based mutual learning to enhance the rendering consistency among multiple sub-NeRFs and mitigate the depth ambiguity. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that Rad-NeRF can enhance the rendering performance across a wide range of scene types compared with existing single-NeRF and multi-NeRF methods. With only 0.2% extra parameters, Rad-NeRF improves rendering performance by up to 1.5dB. Code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/Rad-NeRF."
Poster,RAGChecker: A Fine-grained Framework for Diagnosing Retrieval-Augmented Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97761,"Dongyu Ru, Lin Qiu, Xiangkun Hu, Tianhang Zhang, Peng Shi, Shuaichen Chang, Cheng Jiayang, Cunxiang Wang, Shichao Sun, Huanyu Li, Zizhao Zhang, Binjie Wang, Jiarong Jiang, Tong He, Zhiguo Wang, Pengfei Liu, Yue Zhang, Zheng Zhang","Despite Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promising capability in leveraging external knowledge, a comprehensive evaluation of RAG systems is still challenging due to the modular nature of RAG, evaluation of long-form responses and reliability of measurements. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained evaluation framework, RAGChecker, that incorporates a suite of diagnostic metrics for both the retrieval and generation modules. Meta evaluation verifies that RAGChecker has significantly better correlations with human judgments than other evaluation metrics. Using RAGChecker, we evaluate 8 RAG systems and conduct an in-depth analysis of their performance, revealing insightful patterns and trade-offs in the design choices of RAG architectures. The metrics of RAGChecker can guide researchers and practitioners in developing more effective RAG systems."
Poster,RAGraph: A General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning Framework,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96065,"Xinke Jiang, Rihong Qiu, Yongxin Xu, WentaoZhang, Yichen Zhu, Ruizhe Zhang, Yuchen Fang, Chu Xu, Junfeng Zhao, Yasha Wang","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential in interpreting relational data across various domains, yet, they often struggle to generalize to unseen graph data that differs markedly from training instances. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called General Retrieval-Augmented Graph Learning (RAGraph), which brings external graph data into the general graph foundation model to improve model generalization on unseen scenarios. On the top of our framework is a toy graph vector library that we established, which captures key attributes, such as features and task-specific label information. During inference, the RAGraph adeptly retrieves similar toy graphs based on key similarities in downstream tasks, integrating the retrieved data to enrich the learning context via the message-passing prompting mechanism. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that RAGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph learning methods in multiple tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification across both dynamic and static datasets. Furthermore, extensive testing confirms that RAGraph consistently maintains high performance without the need for task-specific fine-tuning, highlighting its adaptability, robustness, and broad applicability."
Poster,Rainbow Teaming: Open-Ended Generation of Diverse Adversarial Prompts,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95993,"Mikayel Samvelyan, Sharath Chandra Raparthy, Andrei Lupu, Eric Hambro, Aram Markosyan, Manish Bhatt, Yuning Mao, Minqi Jiang, Jack Parker-Holder, Jakob Foerster, Tim Rocktäschel, Roberta Raileanu","As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent across many real-world applications, understanding and enhancing their robustness to adversarial attacks is of paramount importance. Existing methods for identifying adversarial prompts tend to focus on specific domains, lack diversity, or require extensive human annotations. To address these limitations, we present Rainbow Teaming, a novel black-box approach for producing a diverse collection of adversarial prompts. Rainbow Teaming casts adversarial prompt generation as a quality-diversity problem and uses open-ended search to generate prompts that are both effective and diverse. Focusing on the safety domain, we use Rainbow Teaming to target various state-of-the-art LLMs, including the Llama 2 and Llama 3 models. Our approach reveals hundreds of effective adversarial prompts, with an attack success rate exceeding 90% across all tested models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prompts generated by Rainbow Teaming are highly transferable and that fine-tuning models with synthetic data generated by our method significantly enhances their safety without sacrificing general performance or helpfulness. We additionally explore the versatility of Rainbow Teaming by applying it to question answering and cybersecurity, showcasing its potential to drive robust open-ended self-improvement in a wide range of applications."
Poster,RAMP: Boosting Adversarial Robustness Against Multiple $l_p$ Perturbations for Universal Robustness,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93300,"Enyi Jiang, Gagandeep Singh","Most existing works focus on improving robustness against adversarial attacks bounded by a single $l_p$ norm using adversarial training (AT). However, these AT models' multiple-norm robustness (union accuracy) is still low, which is crucial since in the real-world an adversary is not necessarily bounded by a single norm. The tradeoffs among robustness against multiple $l_p$ perturbations and accuracy/robustness make obtaining good union and clean accuracy challenging. We design a logit pairing loss to improve the union accuracy by analyzing the tradeoffs from the lens of distribution shifts. We connect natural training (NT) with AT via gradient projection, to incorporate useful information from NT into AT, where we empirically and theoretically show it moderates the accuracy/robustness tradeoff. We propose a novel training framework \textbf{RAMP}, to boost the robustness against multiple $l_p$ perturbations. \textbf{RAMP} can be easily adapted for robust fine-tuning and full AT. For robust fine-tuning, \textbf{RAMP} obtains a union accuracy up to $53.3\%$ on CIFAR-10, and $29.1\%$ on ImageNet. For training from scratch, \textbf{RAMP} achieves a union accuracy of $44.6\%$ and good clean accuracy of $81.2\%$ on ResNet-18 against AutoAttack on CIFAR-10. Beyond multi-norm robustness \textbf{RAMP}-trained models achieve superior \textit{universal robustness}, effectively generalizing against a range of unseen adversaries and natural corruptions."
Poster,RandNet-Parareal: a time-parallel PDE solver using Random Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96326,"Guglielmo Gattiglio, Lyudmila Grigoryeva, Massimiliano Tamborrino","Parallel-in-time (PinT) techniques have been proposed to solve systems of time-dependent differential equations by parallelizing the temporal domain. Among them, Parareal computes the solution sequentially using an inaccurate (fast) solver, and then ``corrects'' it using an accurate (slow) integrator that runs in  parallel across temporal subintervals. This work introduces RandNet-Parareal, a novel method to learn the discrepancy between the coarse and fine solutions using random neural networks (RandNets). RandNet-Parareal achieves speed gains up to x125 and x22 compared to the fine solver run serially and Parareal, respectively. Beyond theoretical guarantees of RandNets as universal approximators, these models are quick to train, allowing the PinT solution of partial differential equations on a spatial mesh of up to $10^5$ points with minimal overhead, dramatically increasing the scalability of existing PinT approaches. RandNet-Parareal's numerical performance is illustrated on systems of real-world significance, such as the viscous Burgers' equation, the Diffusion-Reaction equation, the two- and three-dimensional Brusselator, and the shallow water equation."
Poster,Random Cycle Coding: Lossless Compression of Cluster Assignments via Bits-Back Coding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94749,"Daniel Severo, Ashish Khisti, Alireza Makhzani","We present an optimal method for encoding cluster assignments of arbitrary data sets. Our method, Random Cycle Coding (RCC), encodes data sequentially and sends assignment information as cycles of the permutation defined by the order of encoded elements. RCC does not require any training and its worst-case complexity scales quasi-linearly with the size of the largest cluster. We characterize the achievable bit rates as a function of cluster sizes and number of elements, showing RCC consistently outperforms previous methods while requiring less compute and memory resources. Experiments show RCC can save up to $2$ bytes per element when applied to vector databases, and removes the need for assigning integer ids to identify vectors, translating to savings of up to $70\%$ in vector database systems for similarity search applications."
Poster,Random Function Descent,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93048,"Felix Benning, Leif Döring","Classical worst-case optimization theory neither explains the success of optimization in machine learning, nor does it help with step size selection. In this paper we demonstrate the viability and advantages of replacing the classical 'convex function' framework with a 'random function' framework. With complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^3d^3)$, where $n$ is the number of steps and $d$ the number of dimensions, Bayesian optimization with gradients has not been viable in large dimension so far. By bridging the gap between Bayesian optimization (i.e. random function optimization theory) and classical optimization we establish viability. Specifically, we use a 'stochastic Taylor approximation' to rediscover gradient descent, which is scalable in high dimension due to $\mathcal{O}(nd)$ complexity. This rediscovery yields a specific step size schedule we call Random Function Descent (RFD). The advantage of this random function framework is that RFD is scale invariant and that it provides a theoretical foundation for common step size heuristics such as gradient clipping and gradual learning rate warmup."
