Poster,SAND: Smooth imputation of sparse and noisy functional data with Transformer networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95514,"Ju-Sheng Hong, Junwen Yao, Jonas Mueller, Jane-Ling Wang","Although the transformer architecture has come to dominate other models for text and image data, its application to irregularly-spaced longitudinal data has been limited. We introduce a variant of the transformer that enables it to more smoothly impute such functional data. We augment the vanilla transformer with a simple module we call SAND (self-attention on derivatives), which naturally encourages smoothness by modeling the sub-derivative of the imputed curve. On the theoretical front, we prove the number of hidden nodes required by a network with SAND to achieve an $\epsilon$ prediction error bound for functional imputation. Extensive experiments over various types of functional data demonstrate that transformers with SAND produce better imputations than both their standard counterparts as well as transformers augmented with alternative approaches to encode the inductive bias of smoothness. SAND also outperforms standard statistical methods for functional imputation like kernel smoothing and PACE."
Poster,SARAD: Spatial Association-Aware Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis for Multivariate Time Series,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94119,"Zhihao Dai, Ligang He, Shuanghua Yang, Matthew Leeke","Anomaly detection in time series data is fundamental to the design, deployment, and evaluation of industrial control systems. Temporal modeling has been the natural focus of anomaly detection approaches for time series data. However, the focus on temporal modeling can obscure or dilute the spatial information that can be used to capture complex interactions in multivariate time series. In this paper, we propose SARAD, an approach that leverages spatial information beyond data autoencoding errors to improve the detection and diagnosis of anomalies. SARAD trains a Transformer to learn the spatial associations, the pairwise inter-feature relationships which ubiquitously characterize such feedback-controlled systems. As new associations form and old ones dissolve, SARAD applies subseries division to capture their changes over time. Anomalies exhibit association descending patterns, a key phenomenon we exclusively observe and attribute to the disruptive nature of anomalies detaching anomalous features from others. To exploit the phenomenon and yet dismiss non-anomalous descent, SARAD performs anomaly detection via autoencoding in the association space. We present experimental results to demonstrate that SARAD achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing robust anomaly detection and a nuanced understanding of anomalous events."
Poster,SARDet-100K: Towards Open-Source Benchmark and ToolKit for Large-Scale SAR Object Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94539,"Yuxuan Li, Xiang Li, Weijie Li, Qibin Hou, Li Liu, Ming-Ming Cheng, Jian Yang","Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection has gained significant attention recently due to its irreplaceable all-weather imaging capabilities. However, this research field suffers from both limited public datasets (mostly comprising <2K images with only mono-category objects) and inaccessible source code. To tackle these challenges, we establish a new benchmark dataset and an open-source method for large-scale SAR object detection. Our dataset, SARDet-100K, is a result of intense surveying, collecting, and standardizing 10 existing SAR detection datasets, providing a large-scale and diverse dataset for research purposes. To the best of our knowledge, SARDet-100K is the first COCO-level large-scale multi-class SAR object detection dataset ever created. With this high-quality dataset, we conducted comprehensive experiments and uncovered a crucial challenge in SAR object detection: the substantial disparities between the pretraining on RGB datasets and finetuning on SAR datasets in terms of both data domain and model structure. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Multi-Stage with Filter Augmentation (MSFA) pretraining framework that tackles the problems from the perspective of data input, domain transition, and model migration. The proposed MSFA method significantly enhances the performance of SAR object detection models while demonstrating exceptional generalizability and flexibility across diverse models. This work aims to pave the way for further advancements in SAR object detection. The dataset and code is available at \url{https://github.com/zcablii/SARDet_100K}."
Poster,Satformer: Accurate and Robust Traffic Data Estimation for Satellite Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94867,"Liang Qin, Xiyuan Liu, Wenting Wei, Liang Chengbin, Huaxi Gu","The operations and maintenance of satellite networks heavily depend on traffic measurements. Due to the large-scale and highly dynamic nature of satellite networks, global measurement encounters significant challenges in terms of complexity and overhead. Estimating global network traffic data from partial traffic measurements is a promising solution. However, the majority of current estimation methods concentrate on low-rank linear decomposition, which is unable to accurately estimate. The reason lies in its inability to capture the intricate nonlinear spatio-temporal relationship found in large-scale, highly dynamic traffic data. This paper proposes Satformer, an accurate and robust method for estimating traffic data in satellite networks. In Satformer, we innovatively incorporate an adaptive sparse spatio-temporal attention mechanism. In the mechanism, more attention is paid to specific local regions of the input tensor to improve the model's sensitivity on details and patterns. This method enhances its capability to capture nonlinear spatio-temporal relationships. Experiments on small, medium, and large-scale satellite networks datasets demonstrate that Satformer outperforms mathematical and neural baseline methods notably. It provides substantial improvements in reducing errors and maintaining robustness, especially for larger networks. The approach shows promise for deployment in actual systems."
Poster,SaulLM-54B & SaulLM-141B: Scaling Up Domain Adaptation for the Legal Domain,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95446,"Pierre Colombo, Telmo Pessoa Pires, Malik Boudiaf, Rui Melo, Gabriel Hautreux, Etienne Malaboeuf, Johanne Charpentier, Dominic Culver, Michael Desa","In this paper, we introduce SaulLM-medium and SaulLM-large, two large language models (LLMs) families tailored for the legal sector. These models, which feature architectures of 54 billion and 140 billion parameters, respectively, are based on the Mixtral architecture. The development of SaulLM-54B and SaulLM-140B is guided by large-scale domain adaptation,  divided into strategies: (1) the exploitation of continued pretaining involving a legal corpus that includes over $400$ billion tokens, (2) the implementation of a specialized legal instruction-following protocol, and (3) the alignment of model outputs with human preferences in legal interpretations. The integration of synthetically generated data in the second and third steps enhances the models' capabilities in interpreting and processing legal texts, effectively reaching state-of-the-art performance and outperforming all previous open-source models on LegalBench Instruct. This research thoroughly explores the trade-offs involved in domain-specific adaptation at this scale, offering insights that may inform future studies on domain adaptation using strong decoder models. Building upon SaulLM-7B, this study refines the approach to produce an LLM better equipped for legal tasks and domains. Additionally, we release base, instruct and aligned versions on top of SaulLM-medium and SaulLM-large under the MIT License to facilitate reuse and collaborative research."
Poster,SCAFFLSA: Taming Heterogeneity in Federated Linear Stochastic Approximation and TD Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95816,"Paul Mangold, Sergey Samsonov, Safwan Labbi, Ilya Levin, REDA ALAMI, Alexey Naumov, Eric Moulines","In this paper, we analyze the sample and communication complexity of the federated linear stochastic approximation (FedLSA) algorithm. We explicitly quantify the effects of local training with agent heterogeneity. We show that the communication complexity of FedLSA scales polynomially with the inverse of the desired accuracy ϵ. To overcome this, we propose SCAFFLSA a new variant of FedLSA that uses control variates to correct for client drift, and establish its sample and communication complexities. We show that for statistically heterogeneous agents, its communication complexity scales logarithmically with the desired accuracy, similar to Scaffnew. An important finding is that, compared to the existing results for Scaffnew, the sample complexity scales with the inverse of the number of agents, a property referred to as linear speed-up. Achieving this linear speed-up requires completely new theoretical arguments. We apply the proposed method to federated temporal difference learning with linear function approximation and analyze the corresponding complexity improvements."
Poster,Scalable and Effective Arithmetic Tree Generation for Adder and Multiplier Designs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96566,"Yao Lai, Jinxin Liu, David Z. Pan, Ping Luo","Across a wide range of hardware scenarios, the computational efficiency and physical size of the arithmetic units significantly influence the speed and footprint of the overall hardware system. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of prior arithmetic design techniques proves inadequate, as they do not sufficiently optimize speed and area, resulting in increased latency and larger module size. To boost computing performance, this work focuses on the two most common and fundamental arithmetic modules, adders and multipliers. We cast the design tasks as single-player tree generation games, leveraging reinforcement learning techniques to optimize their arithmetic tree structures. This tree generation formulation allows us to efficiently navigate the vast search space and discover superior arithmetic designs that improve computational efficiency and hardware size within just a few hours. Our proposed method, **ArithTreeRL**, achieves significant improvements for both adders and multipliers. For adders, our approach discovers designs of 128-bit adders that achieve Pareto optimality in theoretical metrics. Compared with PrefixRL, it reduces delay and size by up to 26% and 30%, respectively. For multipliers, compared to RL-MUL, our method enhances speed and reduces size by as much as 49% and 45%. Additionally, ArithTreeRL's flexibility and scalability enable seamless integration into 7nm technology. We believe our work will offer valuable insights into hardware design, further accelerating speed and reducing size through the refined search space and our tree generation methodologies."
Poster,Scalable Bayesian Optimization via Focalized Sparse Gaussian Processes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95382,"Yunyue Wei, Vincent Zhuang, Saraswati Soedarmadji, Yanan Sui","Bayesian optimization is an effective technique for black-box optimization, but its applicability is typically limited to low-dimensional and small-budget problems due to the cubic complexity of computing the Gaussian process (GP) surrogate. While various approximate GP models have been employed to scale Bayesian optimization to larger sample sizes, most suffer from overly-smooth estimation and focus primarily on problems that allow for large online samples.  In this work, we argue that Bayesian optimization algorithms with sparse GPs can more efficiently allocate their representational power to relevant regions of the search space. To achieve this, we propose focalized GP, which leverages a novel variational loss function to achieve stronger local prediction, as well as FocalBO, which hierarchically optimizes the focalized GP acquisition function over progressively smaller search spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that FocalBO can efficiently leverage large amounts of offline and online data to achieve state-of-the-art performance on robot morphology design and to control a 585-dimensional musculoskeletal system."
Poster,Scalable Constrained Policy Optimization for Safe Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93564,"Lijun Zhang, Lin Li, Wei Wei, Huizhong Song, Yaodong Yang, Jiye Liang","A challenging problem in seeking to bring multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) techniques into real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and drone swarms, is how to control multiple agents safely and cooperatively to accomplish tasks. Most existing safe MARL methods learn the centralized value function by introducing a global state to guide safety cooperation. However, the global coupling arising from agents’ safety constraints and the exponential growth of the state-action space size limit their applicability in instant communication or computing resource-constrained systems and larger multi-agent systems. In this paper, we develop a novel scalable and theoretically-justified multi-agent constrained policy optimization method. This method utilizes the rigorous bounds of the trust region method and the bounds of the truncated advantage function to provide a new local policy optimization objective for each agent. Also, we prove that the safety constraints and the joint policy improvement can be met when each agent adopts a sequential update scheme to optimize a $\kappa$-hop policy. Then, we propose a practical algorithm called Scalable MAPPO-Lagrangian (Scal-MAPPO-L). The proposed method’s effectiveness is verified on a collection of benchmark tasks, and the results support our theory that decentralized training with local interactions can still improve reward performance and satisfy safe constraints."
Poster,Scalable DBSCAN with Random Projections,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94318,"HaoChuan Xu, Ninh Pham","We present sDBSCAN, a scalable density-based clustering algorithm in high dimensions with cosine distance. sDBSCAN leverages recent advancements in random projections given a significantly large number of random vectors to quickly identify core points and their neighborhoods, the primary hurdle of density-based clustering. Theoretically, sDBSCAN preserves the DBSCAN’s clustering structure under mild conditions with high probability. To facilitate sDBSCAN, we present sOPTICS, a scalable visual tool to guide the parameter setting of sDBSCAN. We also extend sDBSCAN and sOPTICS to L2, L1, χ2, and Jensen-Shannon distances via random kernel features. Empirically, sDBSCAN is significantly faster and provides higher accuracy than competitive DBSCAN variants on real-world million-point data sets. On these data sets, sDBSCAN and sOPTICS run in a few minutes, while the scikit-learn counterparts and other clustering competitors demand several hours orcannot run on our hardware due to memory constraints. Our code is available at https://github.com/NinhPham/sDbscan."
