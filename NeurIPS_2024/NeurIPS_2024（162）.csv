Poster,FUGAL: Feature-fortified Unrestricted Graph Alignment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95090,"Aditya Bommakanti, Harshith Vonteri, Konstantinos Skitsas, Sayan Ranu, Davide Mottin, Panagiotis Karras","The necessity to align two graphs, minimizing a structural distance metric, is prevalent in biology, chemistry, recommender systems, and social network analysis. Due to the problem’s NP-hardness, prevailing graph alignment methods follow a modular and mediated approach, solving the problem by restricting to the domain of intermediary graph representations or products like embeddings, spectra, and graph signals. Restricting the problem to this intermediate space may distort the original problem and are hence predisposed to miss high-quality solutions. In this paper, we propose an unrestricted method, FUGAL, which finds a permutation matrix that maps one graph to another by directly operating on their adjacency matrices with judicious constraint relaxation. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that FUGAL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art graph alignment methods in accuracy across all benchmark datasets without encumbering efficiency."
Poster,FUG: Feature-Universal Graph Contrastive Pre-training for Graphs with Diverse Node Features,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94892,"Jitao Zhao, Di Jin, Meng Ge, Lianze Shan, Xin Wang, Dongxiao He, Zhiyong Feng","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), known for their effective graph encoding, are extensively used across various fields. Graph self-supervised pre-training, which trains GNN encoders without manual labels to generate high-quality graph representations, has garnered widespread attention. However, due to the inherent complex characteristics in graphs, GNNs encoders pre-trained on one dataset struggle to directly adapt to others that have different node feature shapes. This typically necessitates either model rebuilding or data alignment. The former results in non-transferability as each dataset need to rebuild a new model, while the latter brings serious knowledge loss since it forces features into a uniform shape by preprocessing such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To address this challenge, we propose a new Feature-Universal Graph contrastive pre-training strategy (FUG) that naturally avoids the need for model rebuilding and data reshaping. Specifically, inspired by discussions in existing work on the relationship between contrastive Learning and PCA, we conducted a theoretical analysis and discovered that PCA's optimization objective is a special case of that in contrastive Learning. We designed an encoder with contrastive constraints to emulate PCA's generation of basis transformation matrix, which is utilized to losslessly adapt features in different datasets. Furthermore, we introduced a global uniformity constraint to replace negative sampling, reducing the time complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, and by explicitly defining positive samples, FUG avoids the substantial memory requirements of data augmentation. In cross domain experiments, FUG has a performance close to the re-trained new models. The source code is available at: https://github.com/hedongxiao-tju/FUG."
Poster,Full-Atom Peptide Design with Geometric Latent Diffusion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95784,"Xiangzhe Kong, Yinjun Jia, Wenbing Huang, Yang Liu","Peptide design plays a pivotal role in therapeutics, allowing brand new possibility to leverage target binding sites that are previously undruggable. Most existing methods are either inefficient or only concerned with the target-agnostic design of 1D sequences. In this paper, we propose a generative model for full-atom Peptide design with Geometric LAtent Diffusion (PepGLAD) given the binding site. We first establish a benchmark consisting of both 1D sequences and 3D structures from Protein Data Bank (PDB) and literature for systematic evaluation. We then identify two major challenges of leveraging current diffusion-based models for peptide design: the full-atom geometry and the variable binding geometry. To tackle the first challenge, PepGLAD derives a variational autoencoder that first encodes full-atom residues of variable size into fixed-dimensional latent representations, and then decodes back to the residue space after conducting the diffusion process in the latent space. For the second issue, PepGLAD explores a receptor-specific affine transformation to convert the 3D coordinates into a shared standard space, enabling better generalization ability across different binding shapes. Experimental Results show that our method not only improves diversity and binding affinity significantly in the task of sequence-structure co-design, but also excels at recovering reference structures for binding conformation generation."
Poster,Full-Distance Evasion of Pedestrian Detectors in the Physical World,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93824,"Zhi Cheng, Zhanhao Hu, Yuqiu Liu, Jianmin Li, Hang Su, Xiaolin Hu","Many studies have proposed attack methods to generate adversarial patterns for evading pedestrian detection, alarming the computer vision community about the need for more attention to the robustness of detectors. However, adversarial patterns optimized by these methods commonly have limited performance at medium to long distances in the physical world. To overcome this limitation, we identify two main challenges. First, in existing methods, there is commonly an appearance gap between simulated distant adversarial patterns and their physical world counterparts, leading to incorrect optimization. Second, there exists a conflict between adversarial losses at different distances, which causes difficulties in optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a Full Distance Attack (FDA) method. Our physical world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our FDA patterns across various detection models like YOLOv5, Deformable-DETR, and Mask RCNN.

Poster,"Fully Distributed, Flexible Compositional Visual Representations via Soft Tensor Products",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93635,"Bethia Sun, Maurice Pagnucco, Yang Song","Since the inception of the classicalist vs. connectionist debate, it has been argued that the ability to systematically combine  symbol-like entities into compositional representations is crucial for human intelligence. In connectionist systems, the field of disentanglement has gained prominence for its ability to produce explicitly compositional representations; however, it relies on a fundamentally *symbolic, concatenative* representation of compositional structure that clashes with the *continuous, distributed* foundations of deep learning. To resolve this tension, we extend Smolensky's Tensor Product Representation (TPR) and introduce *Soft TPR*, a representational form that encodes compositional structure in an inherently *distributed, flexible* manner, along with *Soft TPR Autoencoder*, a theoretically-principled architecture designed specifically to learn Soft TPRs.  Comprehensive evaluations in the visual representation learning domain demonstrate that the Soft TPR framework consistently outperforms conventional disentanglement alternatives -- achieving state-of-the-art disentanglement, boosting representation learner convergence, and delivering superior sample efficiency and low-sample regime performance in downstream tasks. These findings highlight the promise of a *distributed* and *flexible* approach to representing compositional structure by potentially enhancing alignment with the core principles of deep learning over the conventional symbolic approach."
Poster,Fully Explicit Dynamic Gaussian Splatting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94164,"Junoh Lee, Changyeon Won, Hyunjun Jung, Inhwan Bae, Hae-Gon Jeon","3D Gaussian Splatting has shown fast and high-quality rendering results in static scenes by leveraging dense 3D prior and explicit representations. Unfortunately, the benefits of the prior and representation do not involve novel view synthesis for dynamic motions. Ironically, this is because the main barrier is the reliance on them, which requires increasing training and rendering times to account for dynamic motions. In this paper, we design Explicit 4D Gaussian Splatting (Ex4DGS).Our key idea is to firstly separate static and dynamic Gaussians during training, and to explicitly sample positions and rotations of the dynamic Gaussians at sparse timestamps. The sampled positions and rotations are then interpolated to represent both spatially and temporally continuous motions of objects in dynamic scenes as well as reducing computational cost. Additionally, we introduce a progressive training scheme and a point-backtracking technique that improves Ex4DGS's convergence. We initially train Ex4DGS using short timestamps and progressively extend timestamps, which makes it work well with a few point clouds. The point-backtracking is used to quantify the cumulative error of each Gaussian over time, enabling the detection and removal of erroneous Gaussians in dynamic scenes. Comprehensive experiments on various scenes demonstrate the state-of-the-art rendering quality from our method, achieving fast rendering of 62 fps on a single 2080Ti GPU."
Poster,Fully Unconstrained Online Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96172,"Ashok Cutkosky, Zak Mhammedi","We provide a technique for OLO that obtains regret $G\|w_\star\|\sqrt{T\log(\|w_\star\|G\sqrt{T})} + \|w_\star\|^2 + G^2$ on $G$-Lipschitz losses for any comparison point $w_\star$ without knowing either $G$ or $\|w_\star\|$. Importantly, this matches the optimal bound $G\|w_\star\|\sqrt{T}$ available with such knowledge (up to logarithmic factors), unless either $\|w_\star\|$ or $G$ is so large that even $G\|w_\star\|\sqrt{T}$ is roughly linear in $T$. Thus, at a  high level it matches the optimal bound in all cases in which one can achieve sublinear regret."
Poster,Functional Bilevel Optimization for Machine Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94248,"Ieva Petrulionytė, Julien Mairal, Michael Arbel","In this paper, we introduce a new functional point of view on bilevel optimization problems for machine learning, where the inner objective is minimized over a function space. These types of problems are most often solved by using methods developed in the parametric setting, where the inner objective is strongly convex with respect to the parameters of the prediction function. The functional point of view does not rely on this assumption and notably allows using over-parameterized neural networks as the inner prediction function. We propose scalable and efficient algorithms for the functional bilevel optimization problem and illustrate the benefits of our approach on instrumental regression and reinforcement learning tasks."
Poster,Functional Gradient Flows for Constrained Sampling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93866,"Shiyue Zhang, Longlin Yu, Ziheng Cheng, Cheng Zhang","Recently, through a unified gradient flow perspective of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI), particle-based variational inference methods (ParVIs) have been proposed that tend to combine the best of both worlds. While typical ParVIs such as Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) approximate the gradient flow within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), many attempts have been made recently to replace RKHS with more expressive function spaces, such as neural networks. While successful, these methods are mainly designed for sampling from unconstrained domains. In this paper, we offer a general solution to constrained sampling by introducing a boundary condition for the gradient flow which would confine the particles within the specific domain. This allows us to propose a new functional gradient ParVI method for constrained sampling, called *constrained functional gradient flow* (CFG), with provable continuous-time convergence in total variation (TV). We also present novel numerical strategies to handle the boundary integral term arising from the domain constraints. Our theory and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework."
Poster,Functionally Constrained Algorithm Solves Convex Simple Bilevel Problem,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95326,"Huaqing Zhang, Lesi Chen, Jing Xu, Jingzhao Zhang","This paper studies simple bilevel problems, where a convex upper-level function is minimized over the optimal solutions of a convex lower-level problem. We first show the fundamental difficulty of simple bilevel problems, that the approximate optimal value of such problems is not obtainable by first-order zero-respecting algorithms. Then we follow recent works to pursue the weak approximate solutions. For this goal, we propose a novel method by reformulating them into functionally constrained problems. Our method achieves near-optimal rates for both smooth and nonsmooth problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first near-optimal algorithm that works under standard assumptions of smoothness or Lipschitz continuity for the objective functions."
