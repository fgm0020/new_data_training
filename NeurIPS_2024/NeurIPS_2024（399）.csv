Poster,The Benefits of Balance: From Information Projections to Variance Reduction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93207,"Lang Liu, Ronak Mehta, Soumik Pal, Zaid Harchaoui","Data balancing across multiple modalities and sources appears in various forms in foundation models in machine learning and AI, e.g., in CLIP and DINO. We show that data balancing across modalities and sources actually offers an unsuspected benefit: variance reduction. We present a non-asymptotic statistical bound that quantifies this variance reduction effect and relates it to the eigenvalue decay of Markov operators. Furthermore, we describe how various forms of data balancing in contrastive multimodal learning and self-supervised clustering can be better understood, and even improved upon, owing to our variance reduction viewpoint."
Poster,The Best of Both Worlds: On the Dilemma of Out-of-distribution Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96211,"Qingyang Zhang, Qiuxuan Feng, Joey Tianyi Zhou, Yatao Bian, Qinghua Hu, Changqing Zhang","Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for model trustworthiness which aims to sensitively identity semantic OOD samples and robustly generalize for covariate-shifted OOD samples. However, we discover that the superior OOD detection performance of state-of-the-art methods is achieved by secretly sacrificing the OOD generalization ability. The classification accuracy frequently collapses catastrophically when even slight noise is encountered. Such a phenomenon violates the motivation of trustworthiness and significantly limits the model's deployment in the real world. What is the hidden reason behind such a limitation? In this work, we theoretically demystify the ""\textit{sensitive-robust}"" dilemma that lies in previous OOD detection methods. Consequently, a theory-inspired algorithm is induced to overcome such a dilemma. By decoupling the uncertainty learning objective from a Bayesian perspective, the conflict between OOD detection and OOD generalization is naturally harmonized and a dual-optimized performance could be expected. Empirical studies show that our method achieves superior performance on commonly used benchmarks. To our best knowledge, this work is the first principled OOD detection method that achieves state-of-the-art OOD detection performance without sacrificing OOD generalization ability.

Poster,The Challenges of the Nonlinear Regime for Physics-Informed Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95966,"Andrea Bonfanti, Giuseppe Bruno, Cristina Cipriani","The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) viewpoint is widely employed to analyze the training dynamics of overparameterized Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). However, unlike the case of linear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), we show how the NTK perspective falls short in the nonlinear scenario. Specifically, we establish that the NTK yields a random matrix at initialization that is not constant during training, contrary to conventional belief. Another significant difference from the linear regime is that, even in the idealistic infinite-width limit, the Hessian does not vanish and hence it cannot be disregarded during training. This motivates the adoption of second-order optimization methods. We explore the convergence guarantees of such methods in both linear and nonlinear cases, addressing challenges such as spectral bias and slow convergence. Every theoretical result is supported by numerical examples with both linear and nonlinear PDEs, and we highlight the benefits of second-order methods in benchmark test cases."
Poster,The Closeness of In-Context Learning and Weight Shifting for Softmax Regression,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95116,"Shuai Li, Zhao Song, Yu Xia, Tong Yu, Tianyi Zhou","Large language models (LLMs) are known for their exceptional performance in natural language processing, making them highly effective in many human life-related tasks. The attention mechanism in the Transformer architecture is a critical component of LLMs, as it allows the model to selectively focus on specific input parts. The softmax unit, which is a key part of the attention mechanism, normalizes the attention scores. Hence, the performance of LLMs in various NLP tasks depends significantly on the crucial role played by the attention mechanism with the softmax unit.In-context learning is one of the celebrated abilities of recent LLMs. Without further parameter updates, Transformers can learn to predict based on few in-context examples. However, the reason why Transformers becomes in-context learners is not well understood.Recently, in-context learning has been studied from a mathematical perspective with simplified linear self-attention without softmax unit. Based on a linear regression formulation $\min_x\| Ax  - b \|_2$, existing works show linear Transformers' capability of learning linear functions in context. The capability of Transformers with softmax unit approaching full Transformers, however, remains unexplored.In this work, we study the in-context learning based on a softmax regression formulation $\min_{x} \| \langle \exp(Ax), {\bf 1}_n \rangle^{-1} \exp(Ax) - b \|_2$. We show the upper bounds of the data transformations induced by a single self-attention layer with softmax unit and by gradient-descent on a $\ell_2$ regression loss for softmax prediction function.Our theoretical results imply that when training self-attention-only Transformers for fundamental regression tasks, the models learned by gradient-descent and Transformers show great similarity."
Poster,The Collusion of Memory and Nonlinearity in Stochastic Approximation With Constant Stepsize,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94766,"Dongyan Lucy Huo, Yixuan Zhang, Yudong Chen, Qiaomin Xie","In this work, we investigate stochastic approximation (SA) with Markovian data and nonlinear updates under constant stepsize $\alpha>0$. Existing work has primarily focused on either i.i.d. data or linear update rules. We take a new perspective and carefully examine the simultaneous presence of Markovian dependency of data and nonlinear update rules, delineating how the interplay between these two structures leads to complications that are not captured by prior techniques. By leveraging the smoothness and recurrence properties of the SA updates, we develop a fine-grained analysis of the correlation between the SA iterates $\theta_k$ and Markovian data $x_k$. This enables us to overcome the obstacles in existing analysis and establish for the first time the weak convergence of the joint process $(x_k, \theta_k)$. Furthermore, we present a precise characterization of the asymptotic bias of the SA iterates, given by $\mathbb{E}[\theta_\infty]-\theta^\ast=\alpha(b_\textup{m}+b_\textup{n}+b_\textup{c})+\mathcal{O}(\alpha^{3/2})$. Here, $b_\textup{m}$ is associated with the Markovian noise, $b_\textup{n}$ is tied to the nonlinearity of the SA operator, and notably, $b_\textup{c}$ represents a multiplicative interaction between the Markovian noise and the nonlinearity of the operator, which is absent in previous works. As a by-product of our analysis, we derive finite-time bounds on higher moment $\mathbb{E}[||\theta_k-\theta^\ast||^{2p}]$ and present non-asymptotic geometric convergence rates for the iterates, along with a Central Limit Theorem."
Poster,The Dormant Neuron Phenomenon in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Value Factorization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96673,"Haoyuan Qin, Chennan Ma, Deng, Zhengzhu Liu, Songzhu Mei, Xinwang Liu, Cheng Wang, Siqi Shen","In this work, we study the dormant neuron phenomenon in multi-agent reinforcement learning value factorization, where the mixing network suffers from reduced network expressivity caused by an increasing number of inactive neurons. We demonstrate the presence of the dormant neuron phenomenon across multiple environments and algorithms, and show that this phenomenon negatively affects the learning process. We show that dormant neurons correlates with the existence of over-active neurons, which have large activation scores. To address the dormant neuron issue, we propose ReBorn, a simple but effective method that transfers the weights from over-active neurons to dormant neurons. We theoretically show that this method can ensure the learned action preferences are not forgotten after the weight-transferring procedure, which increases learning effectiveness. Our extensive experiments reveal that ReBorn achieves promising results across various environments and improves the performance of multiple popular value factorization approaches. The source code of ReBorn is available in \url{https://github.com/xmu-rl-3dv/ReBorn}."
Poster,The Edge-of-Reach Problem in Offline Model-Based Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96730,"Anya Sims, Cong Lu, Jakob Foerster, Yee Whye Teh","Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to train agents from pre-collected datasets. However, this comes with the added challenge of estimating the value of behaviors not covered in the dataset. Model-based methods offer a potential solution by training an approximate dynamics model, which then allows collection of additional synthetic data via rollouts in this model. The prevailing theory treats this approach as online RL in an approximate dynamics model, and any remaining performance gap is therefore understood as being due to dynamics model errors. In this paper, we analyze this assumption and investigate how popular algorithms perform as the learned dynamics model is improved. In contrast to both intuition and theory, if the learned dynamics model is replaced by the true error-free dynamics, existing model-based methods completely fail. This reveals a key oversight: The theoretical foundations assume sampling of full horizon rollouts in the learned dynamics model; however, in practice, the number of model-rollout steps is aggressively reduced to prevent accumulating errors. We show that this truncation of rollouts results in a set of edge-of-reach states at which we are effectively ""bootstrapping from the void."" This triggers pathological value overestimation and complete performance collapse. We term this the edge-of-reach problem. Based on this new insight, we fill important gaps in existing theory, and reveal how prior model-based methods are primarily addressing the edge-of-reach problem, rather than model-inaccuracy as claimed. Finally, we propose Reach-Aware Value Learning (RAVL), a simple and robust method that directly addresses the edge-of-reach problem and hence - unlike existing methods - does not fail as the dynamics model is improved. Since world models will inevitably improve, we believe this is a key step towards future-proofing offline RL."
Poster,The Elephant in the Room: Towards A Reliable Time-Series Anomaly Detection Benchmark,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97690,"Qinghua Liu, John Paparrizos","Time-series anomaly detection is a fundamental task across scientific fields and industries. However, the field has long faced the ``elephant in the room:'' critical issues including flawed datasets, biased evaluation measures, and inconsistent benchmarking practices that have remained largely ignored and unaddressed.  We introduce the TSB-AD to systematically tackle these issues in the following three aspects: (i) Dataset Integrity: with 1070 high-quality time series from a diverse collection of 40 datasets (doubling the size of the largest collection and four times the number of existing curated datasets), we provide the first large-scale, heterogeneous, meticulously curated dataset that combines the effort of human perception and model interpretation; (ii) Measure Reliability: by revealing issues and biases in evaluation measures, we identify the most reliable and accurate measure, namely, VUS-PR for anomaly detection in time series to address concerns from the community; and (iii) Comprehensive Benchmarking: with a broad spectrum of 40 detection algorithms, from statistical methods to the latest foundation models, we perform a comprehensive evaluation that includes a thorough hyperparameter tuning and a unified setup for a fair and reproducible comparison. Our findings challenge the conventional wisdom regarding the superiority of advanced neural network architectures, revealing that simpler architectures and statistical methods often yield better performance. The promising performance of neural networks on multivariate cases and foundation models on point anomalies highlights the need for further advancements in these methods. We open-source the benchmark at https://github.com/TheDatumOrg/TSB-AD to promote further research."
Poster,"The Empirical Impact of Neural Parameter Symmetries, or Lack Thereof",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93573,"Derek Lim, Theo Putterman, Robin Walters, Haggai Maron, Stefanie Jegelka","Many algorithms and observed phenomena in deep learning appear to be affected by parameter symmetries --- transformations of neural network parameters that do not change the underlying neural network function. These include linear mode connectivity, model merging, Bayesian neural network inference, metanetworks, and several other characteristics of optimization or loss-landscapes. However, theoretical analysis of the relationship between parameter space symmetries and these phenonmena is difficult. In this work, we empirically investigate the impact of neural parameter symmetries by introducing new neural network architectures that have reduced parameter space symmetries. We develop two methods, with some provable guarantees, of modifying standard neural networks to reduce parameter space symmetries.  With these new methods, we conduct a comprehensive experimental study consisting of multiple tasks aimed at assessing the effect of removing parameter symmetries. Our experiments reveal several interesting observations on the empirical impact of parameter symmetries; for instance, we observe linear mode connectivity between our networks without alignment of weight spaces, and we find that our networks allow for faster and more effective Bayesian neural network training."
Poster,The Evolution of Statistical Induction Heads: In-Context Learning Markov Chains,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93487,"Ezra Edelman, Nikolaos Tsilivis, Benjamin Edelman, Eran Malach, Surbhi Goel","Large language models have the ability to generate text that mimics patterns in their inputs. We introduce a simple Markov Chain sequence modeling task in order to study how this in-context learning capability emerges. In our setting, each example is sampled from a Markov chain drawn from a prior distribution over Markov chains. Transformers trained on this task form \emph{statistical induction heads} which compute accurate next-token probabilities given the bigram statistics of the context. During the course of training, models pass through multiple phases: after an initial stage in which predictions are uniform, they learn to sub-optimally predict using in-context single-token statistics (unigrams); then, there is a rapid phase transition to the correct in-context bigram solution. We conduct an empirical and theoretical investigation of this multi-phase process, showing how successful learning results from the interaction between the transformer's layers, and uncovering evidence that the presence of the simpler unigram solution may delay formation of the final bigram solution. We examine how learning is affected by varying the prior distribution over Markov chains, and consider the generalization of our in-context learning of Markov chains (ICL-MC) task to $n$-grams for $n > 2$."
