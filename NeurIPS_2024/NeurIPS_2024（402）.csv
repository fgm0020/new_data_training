Poster,The Iterative Optimal Brain Surgeon: Faster Sparse Recovery by Leveraging Second-Order Information,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93373,"Diyuan Wu, Ionut-Vlad Modoranu, Mher Safaryan, Denis Kuznedelev, Dan Alistarh","The rising footprint of machine learning has led to a focus on imposing model sparsity as a means of reducing computational and memory costs. For deep neural networks (DNNs), the state-of-the-art accuracy-vs-sparsity is achieved by heuristics inspired by the classical Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) framework [LeCun et al., 1989, Hassibi and Stork, 1992, Hassibi et al., 1993], which leverages loss curvature information to make better pruning decisions. Yet, these results still lack a solid theoretical understanding, and it is unclear whether they can be improved by leveraging connections to the wealth of work on sparse recovery algorithms. In this paper, we draw new connections between these two areas and present new sparse recovery algorithms inspired by the OBS framework that come with theoretical guarantees under reasonable assumptions and have strong practical performance. Specifically, our work starts from the observation that we can leverage curvature information in OBS-like fashion upon the projection step of classic iterative sparse recovery algorithms such as IHT. We show for the first time that this leads both to improved convergence bounds in well-behaved settings and to stronger practical convergence. Furthermore, we present extensions of this approach to training accurate sparse DNNs, and validate it experimentally at scale."
Poster,The Ladder in Chaos: Improving Policy Learning by Harnessing the Parameter Evolving Path in A Low-dimensional Space,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96705,"Hongyao Tang, Min Zhang, Chen Chen, Jianye Hao","Knowing the learning dynamics of policy is significant to unveiling the mysteries of Reinforcement Learning (RL). It is especially crucial yet challenging to Deep RL, from which the remedies to notorious issues like sample inefficiency and learning instability could be obtained. In this paper, we study how the policy networks of typical DRL agents evolve during the learning process by empirically investigating several kinds of temporal change for each policy parameter. In popular MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite (DMC) environments, we find common phenomena for TD3 and RAD agents: (1) the activity of policy network parameters is highly asymmetric and policy networks advance monotonically along a very limited number of major parameter directions; (2) severe detours occur in parameter update and harmonic-like changes are observed for all minor parameter directions. By performing a novel temporal SVD along the policy learning path, the major and minor parameter directions are identified as the columns of the right unitary matrix associated with dominant and insignificant singular values respectively. Driven by the discoveries above, we propose a simple and effective method, called Policy Path Trimming and Boosting (PPTB), as a general plug-in improvement to DRL algorithms. The key idea of PPTB is to trim the policy learning path by canceling the policy updates in minor parameter directions, and boost the learning path by encouraging the advance in major directions. In experiments, we demonstrate that our method improves the learning performance of TD3, RAD, and DoubleDQN regarding scores and efficiency in MuJoCo, DMC, and MinAtar tasks respectively."
Poster,The Limits of Differential Privacy in Online Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96120,"Bo Li, Wei Wang, Peng Ye","Differential privacy (DP) is a formal notion that restricts the privacy leakage of an algorithm when running on sensitive data, in which privacy-utility trade-off is one of the central problems in private data analysis. In this work, we investigate the fundamental limits of differential privacy in online learning algorithms and present evidence that separates three types of constraints: no DP, pure DP, and approximate DP. We first describe a hypothesis class that is online learnable under approximate DP but not online learnable under pure DP under the adaptive adversarial setting. This indicates that approximate DP must be adopted when dealing with adaptive adversaries. We then prove that any private online learner must make an infinite number of mistakes for almost all hypothesis classes. This essentially generalizes previous results and shows a strong separation between private and non-private settings since a finite mistake bound is always attainable (as long as the class is online learnable) when there is no privacy requirement."
Poster,The Limits of Transfer Reinforcement Learning with Latent Low-rank Structure,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93563,"Tyler Sam, Yudong Chen, Christina Yu","Many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are too costly to use in practice due to the large sizes $S,A$ of the problem's state and action space. To resolve this issue, we study transfer RL with latent low rank structure. We consider the problem of transferring a latent low rank representation when the source and target MDPs have transition kernels with Tucker rank $(S, d, A)$, $(S ,S , d), (d, S , A )$, or $(d , d , d )$. In each setting, we introduce the transfer-ability coefficient $\alpha$ that measures the difficulty of representational transfer. Our algorithm learns latent representations in each source MDP and then exploits the linear structure to remove the dependence on $S , A $, or $SA $ in the target MDP regret bound. We complement our positive results with information theoretic lower bounds that show our algorithms (excluding the ($d, d, d$) setting) are minimax-optimal with respect to $\alpha$."
Poster,The Mamba in the Llama: Distilling and Accelerating Hybrid Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93289,"Junxiong Wang, Daniele Paliotta, Avner May, Alexander Rush, Tri Dao","Linear RNN architectures, like Mamba, can be competitive with Transformer models in language modeling while having advantageous deployment characteristics. Given the focus on training large-scale Transformer models, we consider the challenge of converting these pretrained models for deployment. We demonstrate that it is feasible to distill large Transformers into linear RNNs by reusing the linear projection weights from attention layers with academic GPU resources. The resulting hybrid model, which incorporates a quarter of the attention layers, achieves performance comparable to the original Transformer in chat benchmarks and outperforms open-source hybrid Mamba models trained from scratch with trillions of tokens in both chat benchmarks and general benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates the inference speed of Mamba and hybrid models. Overall we show how, with limited computation resources, we can remove many of the original attention layers and generate from the resulting model more efficiently. Our top-performing model, distilled from Llama3-8B-Instruct, achieves a 29.61 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2 against GPT-4 and 7.35 on MT-Bench, surpassing the best 8B scale instruction-tuned linear RNN model.  We also find that the distilled model has natural length extrapolation, showing almost perfect accuracy in the needle-in-a-haystack test at 20x the distillation length. Code and pre-trained checkpoints are open-sourced at [MambaInLlama](https://github.com/jxiw/MambaInLlama) for distillation and [SpeculativeMamba](https://github.com/itsdaniele/speculative\_mamba) for speculative decoding."
Poster,The Many Faces of Optimal Weak-to-Strong Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92972,"Mikael Møller Høgsgaard, Kasper Green Larsen, Markus Engelund Mathiasen","Boosting is an extremely successful idea, allowing one to combine multiple low accuracy classifiers into a much more accurate voting classifier. In this work, we present a new and surprisingly simple Boosting algorithm that obtains a provably optimal sample complexity. Sample optimal Boosting algorithms have only recently been developed, and our new algorithm has the fastest runtime among all such algorithms and is the simplest to describe: Partition your training data into 5 disjoint pieces of equal size, run AdaBoost on each, and combine the resulting classifiers via a majority vote. In addition to this theoretical contribution, we also perform the first empirical comparison of the proposed sample optimal Boosting algorithms. Our pilot empirical study suggests that our new algorithm might outperform previous algorithms on large data sets."
Poster,The Map Equation Goes Neural: Mapping Network Flows with Graph Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94570,"Christopher Blöcker, Chester Tan, Ingo Scholtes","Community detection is an essential tool for unsupervised data exploration and revealing the organisational structure of networked systems. With a long history in network science, community detection typically relies on objective functions, optimised with custom-tailored search algorithms, but often without leveraging recent advances in deep learning. Recently, first works have started incorporating such objectives into loss functions for deep graph clustering and pooling. We consider the map equation, a popular information-theoretic objective function for unsupervised community detection, and express it in differentiable tensor form for optimisation through gradient descent. Our formulation turns the map equation compatible with any neural network architecture, enables end-to-end learning, incorporates node features, and chooses the optimal number of clusters automatically, all without requiring explicit regularisation. Applied to unsupervised graph clustering tasks, we achieve competitive performance against state-of-the-art deep graph clustering baselines in synthetic and real-world datasets."
Poster,The Minimax Rate of HSIC Estimation for Translation-Invariant Kernels,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95630,"Florian Kalinke, Zoltan Szabo","Kernel techniques are among the most influential approaches in data science and statistics. Under mild conditions, the reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated to a kernel is capable of encoding the independence of $M\ge2$ random variables. Probably the most widespread independence measure relying on kernels is the so-called Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC; also referred to as distance covariance in the statistics literature). Despite various existing HSIC estimators designed since its introduction close to two decades ago, the fundamental question of the rate at which HSIC can be estimated is still open. In this work, we prove that the minimax optimal rate of HSIC estimation on $\mathbb{R}^d$ for Borel measures containing the Gaussians with continuous bounded translation-invariant  characteristic  kernels  is $\mathcal{O}\left(n^{-1/2}\right)$. Specifically, our result implies the optimality in the minimax sense of many of the most-frequently used estimators (including the U-statistic, the V-statistic, and the Nyström-based one) on $\mathbb{R}^d$."
Poster,The motion planning neural circuit in goal-directed navigation as Lie group operator search,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95206,"Junfeng Zuo, Ying Nian Wu, Si Wu, Wenhao Zhang","The information processing in the brain and embodied agents form a sensory-action loop to interact with the world. An important step in the loop is motion planning which selects motor actions based on the current world state and task need. In goal-directed navigation, the brain chooses and generates motor actions to bring the current state into the goal state. It is unclear about the neural circuit mechanism of motor action selection, nor its underlying theory. The present study formulates the motion planning as a Lie group operator search problem, and uses the 1D rotation group as an example to provide insight into general operator search in neural circuits. We found the abstract group operator search can be implemented by a two-layer feedforward circuit utilizing circuit motifs of connection phase shift, nonlinear activation function, and pooling, similar to Drosophila's goal-directed navigation neural circuits. And the computational complexity of the feedforward circuit can be even lower than common signal processing algorithms in certain conditions. We also provide geometric interpretations of circuit computation in the group representation space. The feedforward motion planning circuit is further combined with sensory and motor circuit modules into a full circuit of the sensory-action loop implementing goal-directed navigation. Our work for the first time links the abstract operator search with biological neural circuits."
