Poster,Predictive Attractor Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93788,"Ramy Mounir, Sudeep Sarkar","Sequential memory, the ability to form and accurately recall a sequence of events or stimuli in the correct order, is a fundamental prerequisite for biological and artificial intelligence as it underpins numerous cognitive functions (e.g., language comprehension, planning, episodic memory formation, etc.) However, existing methods of sequential memory suffer from catastrophic forgetting, limited capacity, slow iterative learning procedures, low-order Markov memory, and, most importantly, the inability to represent and generate multiple valid future possibilities stemming from the same context. Inspired by biologically plausible neuroscience theories of cognition, we propose Predictive Attractor Models (PAM), a novel sequence memory architecture with desirable generative properties. PAM is a streaming model that learns a sequence in an online, continuous manner by observing each input only once. Additionally, we find that PAM avoids catastrophic forgetting by uniquely representing past context through lateral inhibition in cortical minicolumns, which prevents new memories from overwriting previously learned knowledge. PAM generates future predictions by sampling from a union set of predicted possibilities; this generative ability is realized through an attractor model trained alongside the predictor. We show that PAM is trained with local computations through Hebbian plasticity rules in a biologically plausible framework. Other desirable traits (e.g., noise tolerance, CPU-based learning, capacity scaling) are discussed throughout the paper. Our findings suggest that PAM represents a significant step forward in the pursuit of biologically plausible and computationally efficient sequential memory models, with broad implications for cognitive science and artificial intelligence research.

Poster,Predictor-Corrector Enhanced Transformers with Exponential Moving Average Coefficient Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94940,"Bei Li, Tong Zheng, Rui Wang, Jiahao Liu, 清妍 郭, Junliang Guo, Xu Tan, Tong Xiao, JingBo Zhu, Jingang Wang, Xunliang Cai","Residual networks, as discrete approximations of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), have inspired significant advancements in neural network design, including multistep methods, high-order methods, and multi-particle dynamical systems. The precision of the solution to ODEs significantly affects parameter optimization, thereby impacting model performance. In this work, we present a series of advanced explorations of Transformer architecture design to minimize the error compared to the true ``solution.'' First, we introduce a predictor-corrector learning framework to minimize truncation errors, which consists of a high-order predictor and a multistep corrector. Second, we propose an exponential moving average-based coefficient learning method to strengthen our higher-order predictor. Extensive experiments on large-scale machine translation, abstractive summarization, language modeling, and natural language understanding benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach. On the WMT'14 English-German and English-French tasks, our model achieved BLEU scores of 30.95 and 44.27, respectively. Furthermore, on the OPUS multilingual machine translation task, our model surpasses a robust 3.8B DeepNet by an average of 2.9 SacreBLEU, using only 1/3 parameters. Notably, it also beats LLama models by 5.7 accuracy points on the LM Harness Evaluation."
Poster,Preference Alignment with Flow Matching,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96042,"Minu Kim, Yongsik Lee, Sehyeok Kang, Jihwan Oh, Song Chong, Se-Young Yun","We present Preference Flow Matching (PFM), a new framework for preference alignment that streamlines the integration of preferences into an arbitrary class of pre-trained models. Existing alignment methods require fine-tuning pre-trained models, which presents challenges such as scalability, inefficiency, and the need for model modifications, especially with black-box APIs like GPT-4. In contrast, PFM utilizes flow matching techniques to directly learn from preference data, thereby reducing the dependency on extensive fine-tuning of pre-trained models. By leveraging flow-based models, PFM transforms less preferred data into preferred outcomes, and effectively aligns model outputs with human preferences without relying on explicit or implicit reward function estimation, thus avoiding common issues like overfitting in reward models. We provide theoretical insights that support our method’s alignment with standard preference alignment objectives. Experimental results indicate the practical effectiveness of our method, offering a new direction in aligning a pre-trained model to preference. Our code is available at https://github.com/jadehaus/preference-flow-matching."
Poster,Preference-based Pure Exploration,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95864,"Apurv Shukla, Debabrota Basu","We study the preference-based pure exploration problem for bandits with vector-valued rewards and a set of preferences imposed over them. Specifically, we aim to identify the most preferred policy over a set of arms according to the preferences induced on the reward vectors by an ordering cone $C$. First, to quantify the impact of preferences, we derive a novel lower bound on the sample complexity for identifying the most preferred arm with confidence level $1-\delta$. Our lower bound shows that how the geometry of the preferences and reward vectors changes the hardness of this problem. We further explicate this geometry for Gaussian distributions of rewards, and provide a convex reformulation of the lower bound solvable with linear programming. Then, we leverage this convex reformulation of the lower bound to design the Track and Stop with Preferences (TSwP) algorithm that identifies the most preferred policy. Finally, we derive a new concentration result for vector-valued rewards, and show that TSwP achieves a matching sample complexity upper bound."
Poster,Preference Learning Algorithms Do Not Learn Preference Rankings,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94675,"Angelica Chen, Sadhika Malladi, Lily Zhang, Xinyi Chen, Qiuyi (Richard) Zhang, Rajesh Ranganath, Kyunghyun Cho","Preference learning algorithms (e.g., RLHF and DPO) are frequently used to steer LLMs to produce generations that are more preferred by humans, but our understanding of their inner workings is still limited. In this work, we study the conventional wisdom that preference learning trains models to assign higher likelihoods to more preferred outputs than less preferred outputs, measured via *ranking accuracy*.Surprisingly, we find that most state-of-the-art preference-tuned models achieve a ranking accuracy of less than 60% on common preference datasets. We furthermore derive the *idealized ranking accuracy* that a preference-tuned LLM would achieve if it optimized the DPO or RLHF objective perfectly. We demonstrate that existing models exhibit a significant *alignment gap* -- *i.e.*, a gap between the observed and idealized ranking accuracies. We attribute this discrepancy to the DPO objective, which is empirically and theoretically ill-suited to correct even mild ranking errors in the reference model, and derive a simple and efficient formula for quantifying the difficulty of learning a given preference datapoint.Finally, we demonstrate that ranking accuracy strongly correlates with the empirically popular win rate metric when the model is close to the reference model used in the objective, shedding further light on the differences between on-policy (e.g., RLHF) and off-policy (e.g., DPO) preference learning algorithms."
Poster,Preference Learning of Latent Decision Utilities with a Human-like Model of Preferential Choice,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93675,"Sebastiaan De Peuter, Shibei Zhu, Yujia Guo, Andrew Howes, Samuel Kaski","Preference learning methods make use of models of human choice in order to infer the latent utilities that underlie human behavior. However, accurate modeling of human choice behavior is challenging due to a range of context effects that arise from how humans contrast and evaluate options. Cognitive science has proposed several models that capture these intricacies but, due to their intractable nature, work on preference learning has, in practice, had to rely on tractable but simplified variants of the well-known Bradley-Terry model. In this paper, we take one state-of-the-art intractable cognitive model and propose a tractable surrogate that is suitable for deployment in preference learning.  We then introduce a mechanism for fitting the surrogate to human data and extend it to account for data that cannot be explained by the original cognitive model. We demonstrate on large-scale human data that this model produces significantly better inferences on static and actively elicited data than existing Bradley-Terry variants. We further show in simulation that when using this model for preference learning, we can significantly improve utility in a range of real-world tasks."
Poster,Preferential Normalizing Flows,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93389,"Petrus Mikkola, Luigi Acerbi, Arto Klami","Eliciting a high-dimensional probability distribution from an expert via noisy judgments is notoriously challenging, yet useful for many applications, such as prior elicitation and reward modeling. We introduce a method for eliciting the expert's belief density as a normalizing flow based solely on preferential questions such as comparing or ranking alternatives. This allows eliciting in principle arbitrarily flexible densities, but flow estimation is susceptible to the challenge of collapsing or diverging probability mass that makes it difficult in practice. We tackle this problem by introducing a novel functional prior for the flow, motivated by a decision-theoretic argument, and show empirically that the belief density can be inferred as the function-space maximum a posteriori estimate. We demonstrate our method by eliciting multivariate belief densities of simulated experts, including the prior belief of a general-purpose large language model over a real-world dataset."
Poster,PrefPaint: Aligning Image Inpainting Diffusion Model with Human Preference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94203,"Kendong Liu, Zhiyu Zhu, Chuanhao Li, Hui LIU, Huanqiang Zeng, Junhui Hou","In this paper, we make the first attempt to align diffusion models for image inpainting with human aesthetic standards via a reinforcement learning framework, significantly improving the quality and visual appeal of inpainted images. Specifically, instead of directly measuring the divergence with paired images, we train a reward model with the dataset we construct, consisting of nearly 51,000 images annotated with human preferences. Then, we adopt a reinforcement learning process to fine-tune the distribution of a pre-trained diffusion model for image inpainting in the direction of higher reward. Moreover, we theoretically deduce the upper bound on the error of the reward model, which illustrates the potential confidence of reward estimation throughout the reinforcement alignment process, thereby facilitating accurate regularization.Extensive experiments on inpainting comparison and downstream tasks, such as image extension and 3D reconstruction, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing significant improvements in the alignment of inpainted images with human preference compared with state-of-the-art methods. This research not only advances the field of image inpainting but also provides a framework for incorporating human preference into the iterative refinement of generative models based on modeling reward accuracy, with broad implications for the design of visually driven AI applications.

Poster,Pre-trained Gaussian Processes for Bayesian Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/98319,"Zi Wang, George Dahl, Kevin Swersky, Chansoo Lee, Zachary Nado, Justin Gilmer, Jasper Snoek, Zoubin Ghahramani","Bayesian optimization (BO) has become a popular strategy for global optimization of expensive real-world functions. Contrary to a common expectation that BO is suited to optimizing black-box functions, it actually requires domain knowledge about those functions to deploy BO successfully. Such domain knowledge often manifests in Gaussian process (GP) priors that specify initial beliefs on functions. However, even with expert knowledge, it is non-trivial to quantitatively define a prior. This is especially true for hyperparameter tuning problems on complex machine learning models, where landscapes of tuning objectives are often difficult to comprehend. We seek an alternative practice for setting these functional priors. In particular, we consider the scenario where we have data from similar functions that allow us to pre-train a tighter distribution a priori. We detail what pre-training entails for GPs using a KL divergence based loss function, and propose a new pre-training based BO framework named HyperBO. Theoretically, we show bounded posterior predictions and near-zero regrets for HyperBO without assuming the ""ground truth"" GP prior is known. To verify our approach in realistic setups, we collect a large multi-task hyperparameter tuning dataset by training tens of thousands of configurations of near-state-of-the-art deep learning models on popular image and text datasets, as well as a protein sequence dataset. Our results show that on average, HyperBO is able to locate good hyperparameters at least 3 times more efficiently than the best competing methods on both our new tuning dataset and existing multi-task BO benchmarks."
Poster,Pre-trained Large Language Models Use Fourier Features to Compute Addition,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94033,"Tianyi Zhou, Deqing Fu, Vatsal Sharan, Robin Jia","Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive mathematical reasoning capabilities, yet how they compute basic arithmetic, such as addition, remains unclear. This paper shows that pre-trained LLMs add numbers using Fourier features---dimensions in the hidden state that represent numbers via a set of features sparse in the frequency domain. Within the model, MLP and attention layers use Fourier features in complementary ways: MLP layers primarily approximate the magnitude of the answer using low-frequency features, while attention layers primarily perform modular addition (e.g., computing whether the answer is even or odd) using high-frequency features.Pre-training is crucial for this mechanism: models trained from scratch to add numbers only exploit low-frequency features, leading to lower accuracy.Introducing pre-trained token embeddings to a randomly initialized model rescues its performance.Overall, our analysis demonstrates that appropriate pre-trained representations (e.g., Fourier features) can unlock the ability of Transformers to learn precise mechanisms for algorithmic tasks."
