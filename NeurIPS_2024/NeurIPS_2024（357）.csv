Poster,Scaling White-Box Transformers for Vision,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93129,"Jinrui Yang, Xianhang Li, Druv Pai, Yuyin Zhou, Yi Ma, Yaodong Yu, Cihang Xie","CRATE, a white-box transformer architecture designed to learn compressed and sparse representations, offers an intriguing alternative to standard vision transformers (ViTs) due to its inherent mathematical interpretability. Despite extensive investigations into the scaling behaviors of language and vision transformers, the scalability of CRATE remains an open question which this paper aims to address. Specifically, we propose CRATE-$\alpha$, featuring strategic yet minimal modifications to the sparse coding block in the CRATE architecture design, and a light training recipe designed to improve the scalability of CRATE.Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CRATE-$\alpha$ can effectively scale with larger model sizes and datasets. For example, our CRATE-$\alpha$-B substantially outperforms the prior best CRATE-B model accuracy on ImageNet classification by 3.7%, achieving an accuracy of 83.2%. Meanwhile, when scaling further, our CRATE-$\alpha$-L obtains an ImageNet classification accuracy of 85.1%. More notably, these model performance improvements are achieved while preserving, and potentially even enhancing the interpretability of learned CRATE models, as we demonstrate through showing that the learned token representations of increasingly larger trained CRATE-$\alpha$ models yield increasingly higher-quality unsupervised object segmentation of images."
Poster,Scanning Trojaned Models Using Out-of-Distribution Samples,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93781,"Hossein Mirzaei, Ali Ansari, Bahar Dibaei Nia, Mojtaba Nafez, Moein Madadi, Sepehr Rezaee, Zeinab Taghavi, Arad Maleki, Kian Shamsaie, Mahdi Hajialilue, Jafar Habibi, Mohammad Sabokrou, Mohammad Hossein Rohban","Scanning for trojan (backdoor) in deep neural networks is crucial due to their significant real-world applications. There has been an increasing focus on developing effective general trojan scanning methods across various trojan attacks. Despite advancements, there remains a shortage of methods that perform effectively without preconceived assumptions about the backdoor attack method. Additionally, we have observed that current methods struggle to identify classifiers trojaned using adversarial training. Motivated by these challenges, our study introduces a novel scanning method named TRODO (TROjan scanning by Detection of adversarial shifts in Out-of-distribution samples). TRODO leverages the concept of ""blind spots""—regions where trojaned classifiers erroneously identify out-of-distribution (OOD) samples as in-distribution (ID). We scan for these blind spots by adversarially shifting OOD samples towards in-distribution. The increased likelihood of perturbed OOD samples being classified as ID serves as a signature for trojan detection. TRODO is both trojan and label mapping agnostic, effective even against adversarially trained trojaned classifiers. It is applicable even in scenarios where training data is absent, demonstrating high accuracy and adaptability across various scenarios and datasets, highlighting its potential as a robust trojan scanning strategy."
Poster,SCaR: Refining Skill Chaining for Long-Horizon Robotic Manipulation via Dual Regularization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95151,"Zixuan Chen, Ze Ji, Jing Huo, Yang Gao","Long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks typically involve a series of interrelated sub-tasks spanning multiple execution stages. Skill chaining offers a feasible solution for these tasks by pre-training the skills for each sub-task and linking them sequentially. However, imperfections in skill learning or disturbances during execution can lead to the accumulation of errors in skill chaining process, resulting in execution failures. In this paper, we investigate how to achieve stable and smooth skill chaining for long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks. Specifically, we propose a novel skill chaining framework called Skill Chaining via Dual Regularization (SCaR). This framework applies dual regularization to sub-task skill pre-training and fine-tuning, which not only enhances the intra-skill dependencies within each sub-task skill but also reinforces the inter-skill dependencies between sequential sub-task skills, thus ensuring smooth skill chaining and stable long-horizon execution. We evaluate the SCaR framework on two representative long-horizon robotic manipulation simulation benchmarks: IKEA furniture assembly and kitchen organization. Additionally, we conduct a simple real-world validation in tabletop robot pick-and-place tasks. The experimental results show that, with the support of SCaR, the robot achieves a higher success rate in long-horizon tasks compared to relevant baselines and demonstrates greater robustness to perturbations."
Poster,SceneCraft: Layout-Guided 3D Scene Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96143,"Xiuyu Yang, Yunze Man, Junkun Chen, Yu-Xiong Wang","The creation of complex 3D scenes tailored to user specifications has been a tedious and challenging task with traditional 3D modeling tools. Although some pioneering methods have achieved automatic text-to-3D generation, they are generally limited to small-scale scenes with restricted control over the shape and texture. We introduce SceneCraft, a novel method for generating detailed indoor scenes that adhere to textual descriptions and spatial layout preferences provided by users. Central to our method is a rendering-based technique, which converts 3D semantic layouts into multi-view 2D proxy maps. Furthermore, we design a semantic and depth conditioned diffusion model to generate multi-view images, which are used to learn a neural radiance field (NeRF) as the final scene representation. Without the constraints of panorama image generation, we surpass previous methods in supporting complicated indoor space generation beyond a single room, even as complicated as a whole multi-bedroom apartment with irregular shapes and layouts. Through experimental analysis, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in complex indoor scene generation with diverse textures, consistent geometry, and realistic visual quality."
Poster,SceneDiffuser: Efficient and Controllable Driving Simulation Initialization and Rollout,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94590,"Max Jiang, Yijing Bai, Andre Cornman, Christopher Davis, XIUKUN HUANG, Hong Jeon, Sakshum Kulshrestha, John Lambert, Shuangyu Li, Xuanyu Zhou, Carlos Fuertes, Chang Yuan, Mingxing Tan, Yin Zhou, Dragomir Anguelov","Simulation with realistic and interactive agents represents a key task for autonomous vehicle (AV) software development in order to test AV performance in prescribed, often long-tail scenarios. In this work, we propose SceneDiffuser, a scene-level diffusion prior for traffic simulation. We present a singular framework that unifies two key stages of simulation: scene initialization and scene rollout. Scene initialization refers to generating the initial layout for the traffic in a scene, and scene rollout refers to closed-loop simulation for the behaviors of the agents. While diffusion has been demonstrated to be effective in learning realistic, multimodal agent distributions, two open challenges remain: controllability and closed-loop inference efficiency and realism. To this end, to address controllability challenges, we propose generalized hard constraints, a generalized inference-time constraint mechanism that is simple yet effective. To improve closed-loop inference quality and efficiency, we propose amortized diffusion, a novel diffusion denoising paradigm that amortizes the physical cost of denoising over future simulation rollout steps, reducing the cost of per physical rollout step to a single denoising function evaluation, while dramatically reducing closed-loop errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the Waymo Open Dataset, where we are able to generate distributionally realistic scenes, while obtaining competitive performance in the Sim Agents Challenge, surpassing the state-of-the-art in many realism attributes."
Poster,Scene Graph Disentanglement and Composition for Generalizable Complex Image Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92965,"Yunnan Wang, Ziqiang Li, Wenyao Zhang, Zequn Zhang, Baao Xie, Xihui Liu, Wenjun Zeng, Xin Jin","There has been exciting progress in generating images from natural language or layout conditions. However, these methods struggle to faithfully reproduce complex scenes due to the insufficient modeling of multiple objects and their relationships. To address this issue, we leverage the scene graph, a powerful structured representation, for complex image generation. Different from the previous works that directly use scene graphs for generation, we employ the generative capabilities of variational autoencoders and diffusion models in a generalizable manner, compositing diverse disentangled visual clues from scene graphs. Specifically, we first propose a Semantics-Layout Variational AutoEncoder (SL-VAE) to jointly derive (layouts, semantics) from the input scene graph, which allows a more diverse and reasonable generation in a one-to-many mapping. We then develop a Compositional Masked Attention (CMA) integrated with a diffusion model, incorporating (layouts, semantics) with fine-grained attributes as generation guidance. To further achieve graph manipulation while keeping the visual content consistent, we introduce a Multi-Layered Sampler (MLS) for an ""isolated"" image editing effect. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms recent competitors based on text, layout, or scene graph, in terms of generation rationality and controllability."
Poster,Scene Graph Generation with Role-Playing Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93060,"Guikun Chen, Jin Li, Wenguan Wang","Current approaches for open-vocabulary scene graph generation (OVSGG) use vision-language models such as CLIP and follow a standard zero-shot pipeline – computing similarity between the query image and the text embeddings for each category (i.e., text classifiers). In this work, we argue that the text classifiers adopted by existing OVSGG methods, i.e., category-/part-level prompts, are scene-agnostic as they remain unchanged across contexts. Using such fixed text classifiers not only struggles to model visual relations with high variance, but also falls short in adapting to distinct contexts. To plug these intrinsic shortcomings, we devise SDSGG, a scene-specific description based OVSGG framework where the weights of text classifiers are adaptively adjusted according to the visual content. In particular, to generate comprehensive and diverse descriptions oriented to the scene, an LLM is asked to play different roles (e.g., biologist and engineer) to analyze and discuss the descriptive features of a given scene from different views. Unlike previous efforts simply treating the generated descriptions as mutually equivalent text classifiers, SDSGG is equipped with an advanced renormalization mechanism to adjust the influence of each text classifier based on its relevance to the presented scene (this is what the term “specific” means). Furthermore, to capture the complicated interplay between subjects and objects, we propose a new lightweight module called mutual visual adapter. It refines CLIP’s ability to recognize relations by learning an interaction-aware semantic space. Extensive experiments on prevalent benchmarks show that SDSGG significantly outperforms top-leading methods."
Poster,Schedule Your Edit: A Simple yet Effective Diffusion Noise Schedule for Image Editing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94668,"Haonan Lin, Yan Chen, Jiahao Wang, Wenbin An, Mengmeng Wang, Feng Tian, Yong Liu, Guang Dai, Jingdong Wang, QianYing Wang","Text-guided diffusion models have significantly advanced image editing, enabling high-quality and diverse modifications driven by text prompts. However, effective editing requires inverting the source image into a latent space, a process often hindered by prediction errors inherent in DDIM inversion. These errors accumulate during the diffusion process, resulting in inferior content preservation and edit fidelity, especially with conditional inputs. We address these challenges by investigating the primary contributors to error accumulation in DDIM inversion and identify the singularity problem in traditional noise schedules as a key issue. To resolve this, we introduce the *Logistic Schedule*, a novel noise schedule designed to eliminate singularities, improve inversion stability, and provide a better noise space for image editing. This schedule reduces noise prediction errors, enabling more faithful editing that preserves the original content of the source image. Our approach requires no additional retraining and is compatible with various existing editing methods. Experiments across eight editing tasks demonstrate the Logistic Schedule's superior performance in content preservation and edit fidelity compared to traditional noise schedules, highlighting its adaptability and effectiveness.

Poster,Schrodinger Bridge Flow for Unpaired Data Translation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96877,"Valentin De Bortoli, Iryna Korshunova, Andriy Mnih, Arnaud Doucet","Mass transport problems arise in many areas of machine learning whereby one wants to compute a map transporting one distribution to another. Generative modeling techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Denoising Diffusion Models (DMMs) have been successfully adapted to solve such transport problems, resulting in CycleGAN and Bridge Matching respectively. However, these methods do not approximate Optimal Transport (OT) maps, which are known to have desirable properties. Existing techniques approximating OT maps for high-dimensional data-rich problems, including DDMs-based Rectified Flow and Schrodinger bridge procedures, require fully training a DDM-type model at each iteration, or use mini-batch techniques which can introduce significant errors. We propose a novel algorithm to compute the Schrodinger bridge, a dynamic entropy-regularized version of OT, that eliminates the need to train multiple DDMs-like models. This algorithm corresponds to a discretization of a flow of path measures, referred to as the Schrodinger Bridge Flow, whose only stationary point is the Schrodinger bridge. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a variety of unpaired data translation tasks."
Poster,Schur Nets: exploiting local structure for equivariance in higher order graph neural networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95836,"QINGQI ZHANG, Ruize Xu, Risi Kondor","Recent works have shown that extending the message passing paradigm to subgraphs communicating with other subgraphs, especially via higher order messages, can boost the expressivity of graph neural networks. In such architectures, to faithfully account for local structure such as cycles, the local operations must be equivariant to the automorphism group of the local environment. However, enumerating the automorphism groups of all subgraphs of interest and finding appropriate equivariant operations for each one of them separately is generally not feasible. In this paper we propose a solution to this problem based on spectral graph theory that bypasses having to determine the automorphism group entirely and constructs a basis for equivariant operations directly from the graph Laplacian. We show that this approach can boost the performance of GNNs on some standard benchmarks."
