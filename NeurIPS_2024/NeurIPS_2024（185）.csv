Poster,High-Resolution Image Harmonization with Adaptive-Interval Color Transformation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93954,"Quanling Meng, Liu Qinglin, Zonglin Li, Xiangyuan Lan, Shengping Zhang, Liqiang Nie","Existing high-resolution image harmonization methods typically rely on global color adjustments or the upsampling of parameter maps. However, these methods ignore local variations, leading to inharmonious appearances. To address this problem, we propose an Adaptive-Interval Color Transformation method (AICT), which predicts pixel-wise color transformations and adaptively adjusts the sampling interval to model local non-linearities of the color transformation at high resolution. Specifically, a parameter network is first designed to generate multiple position-dependent 3-dimensional lookup tables (3D LUTs), which use the color and position of each pixel to perform pixel-wise color transformations. Then, to enhance local variations adaptively, we separate a color transform into a cascade of sub-transformations using two 3D LUTs to achieve the non-uniform sampling intervals of the color transform. Finally, a global consistent weight learning method is proposed to predict an image-level weight for each color transform, utilizing global information to enhance the overall harmony. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AICT achieves state-of-the-art performance with a lightweight architecture. The code is available at https://github.com/aipixel/AICT."
Poster,Hints-In-Browser: Benchmarking Language Models for Programming Feedback Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97759,"Nachiket Kotalwar, Alkis Gotovos, Adish Singla","Generative AI and large language models hold great promise in enhancing programming education by generating individualized feedback and hints for learners. Recent works have primarily focused on improving the quality of generated feedback to achieve human tutors' quality. While quality is an important performance criterion, it is not the only criterion to optimize for real-world educational deployments. In this paper, we benchmark language models for programming feedback generation across several performance criteria, including quality, cost, time, and data privacy. The key idea is to leverage recent advances in the new paradigm of in-browser inference that allow running these models directly in the browser, thereby providing direct benefits across cost and data privacy. To boost the feedback quality of small models compatible with in-browser inference engines, we develop a fine-tuning pipeline based on GPT-4 generated synthetic data. We showcase the efficacy of fine-tuned Llama3-8B and Phi3-3.8B 4-bit quantized models using WebLLM's in-browser inference engine on three different Python programming datasets. We will release the full implementation along with a web app and datasets to facilitate further research on in-browser language models."
Poster,HippoRAG: Neurobiologically Inspired Long-Term Memory for Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94043,"Bernal Jimenez Gutierrez, Yiheng Shu, Yu Gu, Michihiro Yasunaga, Yu Su","In order to thrive in hostile and ever-changing natural environments, mammalian brains evolved to store large amounts of knowledge about the world and continually integrate new information while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Despite the impressive accomplishments, large language models (LLMs), even with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), still struggle to efficiently and effectively integrate a large amount of new experiences after pre-training. In this work, we introduce HippoRAG, a novel retrieval framework inspired by the hippocampal indexing theory of human long-term memory to enable deeper and more efficient knowledge integration over new experiences. HippoRAG synergistically orchestrates LLMs, knowledge graphs, and the Personalized PageRank algorithm to mimic the different roles of neocortex and hippocampus in human memory. We compare HippoRAG with existing RAG methods on multi-hop question answering (QA) and show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods remarkably, by up to 20%. Single-step retrieval with HippoRAG achieves comparable or better performance than iterative retrieval like IRCoT while being 10-20 times cheaper and 6-13 times faster, and integrating HippoRAG into IRCoT brings further substantial gains. Finally, we show that our method can tackle new types of scenarios that are out of reach of existing methods."
Poster,Historical Test-time Prompt Tuning for Vision Foundation Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94515,"Jingyi Zhang, Jiaxing Huang, Xiaoqin Zhang, Ling Shao, Shijian Lu","Test-time prompt tuning, which learns prompts online with unlabelled test samples during the inference stage, has demonstrated great potential by learning effective prompts on-the-fly without requiring any task-specific annotations. However, its performance often degrades clearly along the tuning process when the prompts are continuously updated with the test data flow, and the degradation becomes more severe when the domain of test samples changes continuously. We propose HisTPT, a Historical Test-time Prompt Tuning technique that memorizes the useful knowledge of the learnt test samples and enables robust test-time prompt tuning with the memorized knowledge. HisTPT introduces three types of knowledge banks, namely, local knowledge bank, hard-sample knowledge bank, and global knowledge bank, each of which works with different mechanisms for effective knowledge memorization and test-time prompt optimization. In addition, HisTPT features an adaptive knowledge retrieval mechanism that regularizes the prediction of each test sample by adaptively retrieving the memorized knowledge. Extensive experiments show that HisTPT achieves superior prompt tuning performance consistently while handling different visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection) and test samples from continuously changing domains."
Poster,HLM-Cite: Hybrid Language Model Workflow for Text-based Scientific Citation Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95366,"Qianyue Hao, Jingyang Fan, Fengli Xu, Jian Yuan, Yong Li","Citation networks are critical infrastructures of modern science, serving as intricate webs of past literature and enabling researchers to navigate the knowledge production system. To mine information hiding in the link space of such networks, predicting which previous papers (candidates) will a new paper (query) cite is a critical problem that has long been studied. However, an important gap remains unaddressed: the roles of a paper's citations vary significantly, ranging from foundational knowledge basis to superficial contexts. Distinguishing these roles requires a deeper understanding of the logical relationships among papers, beyond simple edges in citation networks. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) with textual reasoning capabilities offers new possibilities for discerning these relationships, but there are two major challenges. First, in practice, a new paper may select its citations from gigantic existing papers, where the combined texts far exceed the context length of LLMs. Second, logical relationships between papers are often implicit, and directly prompting an LLM to predict citations may lead to results based primarily on surface-level textual similarities, rather than the deeper logical reasoning required. In this paper, we introduce the novel concept of core citation, which identifies the critical references that go beyond superficial mentions. Thereby, we elevate the citation prediction task from a simple binary classification to a more nuanced problem: distinguishing core citations from both superficial citations and non-citations. To address this, we propose $\textbf{HLM-Cite}$, a $\textbf{H}$ybrid $\textbf{L}$anguage $\textbf{M}$odel workflow for citation prediction, which combines embedding and generative LMs. We design a curriculum finetune procedure to adapt a pretrained text embedding model to coarsely retrieve high-likelihood core citations from vast candidate sets and then design an LLM agentic workflow to rank the retrieved papers through one-shot reasoning, revealing the implicit relationships among papers. With the two-stage pipeline, we can scale the candidate sets to 100K papers, vastly exceeding the size handled by existing methods. We evaluate HLM-Cite on a dataset across 19 scientific fields, demonstrating a 17.6\% performance improvement comparing SOTA methods. Our code is open-source at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/H-LM for reproducibility."
Poster,HOI-Swap: Swapping Objects in Videos with Hand-Object Interaction Awareness,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95885,"Zihui (Sherry) Xue, Romy Luo, Changan Chen, Kristen Grauman","We study the problem of precisely swapping objects in videos, with a focus on those interacted with by hands, given one user-provided reference object image. Despite the great advancements that diffusion models have made in video editing recently, these models often fall short in handling the intricacies of hand-object interactions (HOI), failing to produce realistic edits---especially when object swapping results in object shape or functionality changes. To bridge this gap, we present HOI-Swap, a novel diffusion-based video editing framework trained in a self-supervised manner.  Designed in two stages, the first stage focuses on object swapping in a single frame with HOI awareness; the model learns to adjust the interaction patterns, such as the hand grasp, based on changes in the object's properties. The second stage extends the single-frame edit across the entire sequence; we achieve controllable motion alignment with the original video by: (1) warping a new sequence from the stage-I edited frame based on sampled motion points and (2) conditioning video generation on the warped sequence. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that HOI-Swap significantly outperforms existing methods, delivering high-quality video edits with realistic HOIs."
Poster,Hollowed Net for On-Device Personalization of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95300,"Wonguk Cho, Seokeon Choi, Debasmit Das, Matthias Reisser, Taesup Kim, Sungrack Yun, Fatih Porikli","Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have enabled the personalization of these models to generate custom images from textual prompts. This paper presents an efficient LoRA-based personalization approach for on-device subject-driven generation, where pre-trained diffusion models are fine-tuned with user-specific data on resource-constrained devices. Our method, termed Hollowed Net, enhances memory efficiency during fine-tuning by modifying the architecture of a diffusion U-Net to temporarily remove a fraction of its deep layers, creating a hollowed structure. This approach directly addresses on-device memory constraints and substantially reduces GPU memory requirements for training, in contrast to previous methods that primarily focus on minimizing training steps and reducing the number of parameters to update. Additionally, the personalized Hollowed Net can be transferred back into the original U-Net, enabling inference without additional memory overhead. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that our approach not only reduces training memory to levels as low as those required for inference but also maintains or improves personalization performance compared to existing methods."
Poster,Homology Consistency Constrained Efficient Tuning for Vision-Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93196,"Huatian Zhang, Lei Zhang, Yongdong Zhang, Zhendong Mao","Efficient transfer learning has shown remarkable performance in tuning large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) toward downstream tasks with limited data resources. The key challenge of efficient transfer lies in adjusting image-text alignment to be task-specific while preserving pre-trained general knowledge. However, existing methods adjust image-text alignment merely on a set of observed samples, e.g., data set and external knowledge base, which cannot guarantee to keep the correspondence of general concepts between image and text latent manifolds without being disrupted and thereby a weak generalization of the adjusted alignment. In this work, we propose a Homology Consistency (HC) constraint for efficient transfer on VLMs, which explicitly constrains the correspondence of image and text latent manifolds through structural equivalence based on persistent homology in downstream tuning. Specifically, we build simplicial complex on the top of data to mimic the topology of latent manifolds, then track the persistence of the homology classes of topological features across multiple scales, and guide the directions of persistence tracks in image and text manifolds to coincide each other, with a deviating perturbation additionally. For practical application, we tailor the implementation of our proposed HC constraint for two main paradigms of adapter tuning. Extensive experiments on few-shot learning over 11 datasets and domain generalization demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method."
Poster,HonestLLM: Toward an Honest and Helpful Large Language Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96003,"Gao Chujie, Siyuan Wu, Yue Huang, Dongping Chen, Qihui Zhang, Zhengyan Fu, Yao Wan, Lichao Sun, Xiangliang Zhang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various industries and applications, owing to their exceptional generative capabilities. Nevertheless, honesty and helpfulness, which ensure safe and useful real-world deployments, have been considered as the longstanding cornerstones in practice. In this paper, we first established comprehensive principles for honesty LLM and further created the HoneSet with 930 queries across six categories, which is designed to evaluate LLMs’ ability to maintain honesty. Then, we improved the honesty and helpfulness of LLMs in both training-free and fine-tuning settings. Specifically, we propose a training-free method named Curiosity-Driven Prompting, which enables LLMs to express their internal confusion and uncertainty about the given query and then optimize their responses. Moreover, we also propose a two-stage fine-tuning approach, inspired by curriculum learning, to enhance the honesty and helpfulness of LLMs. The method first teaches LLMs to distinguish between honest and dishonest, and then LLMs are trained to learn to respond more helpfully. Experimental results demonstrated that both of the two proposed methods improve the helpfulness of LLMs while making them maintain honesty. Our research has paved the way for more reliable and trustworthy LLMs in real-world applications."
Poster,Honor Among Bandits: No-Regret Learning for Online Fair Division,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95386,"Ariel Procaccia, Ben Schiffer, Shirley Zhang","We consider the problem of online fair division of indivisible goods to players when there are a finite number of types of goods and player values are drawn from distributions with unknown means. Our goal is to maximize social welfare subject to allocating the goods fairly in expectation. When a player's value for an item is unknown at the time of allocation, we show that this problem reduces to a variant of (stochastic) multi-armed bandits, where there exists an arm for each player's value for each type of good. At each time step, we choose a distribution over arms which determines how the next item is allocated. We consider two sets of fairness constraints for this problem: envy-freeness in expectation and proportionality in expectation. Our main result is the design of an explore-then-commit algorithm that achieves $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret while maintaining either fairness constraint. This result relies on unique properties fundamental to fair-division constraints that allow faster rates of learning, despite the restricted action space."
