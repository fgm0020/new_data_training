Poster,Reproducibility Study Of Learning Fair Graph Representations Via Automated Data Augmentations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/99350,"Thijmen Nijdam, Juell Sprott, Taiki Papandreou-Lazos, Jurgen de Heus","In this study, we undertake a reproducibility analysis of ""Learning Fair Graph Representations Via Automated Data Augmentations"" by Ling et al. (2022). We assess the validity of the original claims focused on node classification tasks and explore the performance of the Graphair framework in link prediction tasks. Our investigation reveals that we can partially reproduce one of the original three claims and fully substantiate the other two. Additionally, we broaden the application of Graphair from node classification to link prediction across various datasets. Our findings indicate that, while Graphair demonstrates a comparable fairness-accuracy trade-off to baseline models for mixed dyadic-level fairness, it has a superior trade-off for subgroup dyadic-level fairness. These findings underscore Graphair’s potential for wider adoption in graph-based learning. Our code base can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/juellsprott/graphair-reproducibility."
Poster,"Reproducibility study of “LICO: Explainable Models with Language-Image Consistency""",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/99344,"Luan Fletcher, Robert van der Klis, Martin Sedlacek, Stefan Vasilev, Christos Athanasiadis","The growing reproducibility crisis in machine learning has brought forward a need for careful examination of research findings. This paper investigates the claims made by Lei et al. (2023) regarding their proposed method, LICO, for enhancing post-hoc interpretability techniques and improving image classification performance. LICO leverages natural language supervision from a vision-language model to enrich feature representations and guide the learning process. We conduct a comprehensive reproducibility study, employing (Wide) ResNets and established interpretability methods like Grad-CAM and RISE. We were mostly unable to reproduce the authors' results. In particular, we did not find that LICO consistently led to improved classification performance or improvements in quantitative and qualitative measures of interpretability. Thus, our findings highlight the importance of rigorous evaluation and transparent reporting in interpretability research."
Poster,"Reproducibility study of ""Robust Fair Clustering: A Novel Fairness Attack and Defense Framework""",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/99339,"Lucas Ponticelli, Vincent Loos, Eren Kocadag, Kacper Bartosik","This reproducibility study examines ""Robust Fair Clustering: A Novel Fairness Attack and Defense Framework"" by Chhabra et al. (2023), an innovative work in fair clustering algorithms. Our study focuses on validating the original paper's claims concerning the susceptibility of state-of-the-art fair clustering models to adversarial attacks and the efficacy of the proposed Consensus Fair Clustering (CFC) defence mechanism. We employ a similar experimental framework but extend our investigations by using additional datasets. Our findings confirm the original paper's claims, reinforcing the vulnerability of fair clustering models to adversarial attacks and the robustness of the CFC mechanism."
Poster,"Reproducibility Study of ""Robust Fair Clustering: A Novel Fairness Attack and Defense Framework""",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/99342,"Iason Skylitsis, Zheng Feng, Idries Nasim, Camille Niessink","Clustering algorithms play a pivotal role in various societal applications, where fairness is paramount to prevent adverse impacts on individuals. In this study, we revisit the robustness of fair clustering algorithms against adversarial attacks, affirming previous research findings that highlighted their susceptibility and the resilience of the Consensus Fair Clustering (CFC) model. Beyond reproducing these critical results, our work extends the original analysis by refining the codebase for enhanced experimentation, introducing additional metrics and datasets to deepen the evaluation of fairness and clustering quality, and exploring novel attack strategies, including targeted attacks on new metrics and a combined approach for balance and entropy as well as an ablation study. These contributions validate the original claims about the vulnerability and resilience of fair clustering algorithms and broaden the research landscape by offering a more comprehensive toolkit for assessing adversarial robustness in fair clustering."
Poster,Reproducibility Study on Adversarial Attacks Against Robust Transformer Trackers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/99343,"Fatemeh Nourilenjan Nokabadi, Christian Gagné, Jean-Francois Lalonde","New transformer networks have been integrated into object tracking pipelines and have demonstrated strong performance on the latest benchmarks. This paper focuses on understanding how transformer trackers behave under adversarial attacks and how different attacks perform on tracking datasets as their parameters change. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of existing adversarial attacks on object trackers with transformer and non-transformer backbones. We experimented on 7 different trackers, including 3 that are transformer-based, and 4 which leverage other architectures. These trackers are tested against 4 recent attack methods to assess their performance and robustness on VOT2022ST, UAV123 and GOT10k datasets. Our empirical study focuses on evaluating adversarial robustness of object trackers based on bounding box versus binary mask predictions, and attack methods at different levels of perturbations. Interestingly, our study found that altering the perturbation level may not significantly affect the overall object tracking results after the attack. Similarly, the sparsity and imperceptibility of the attack perturbations may remain stable against perturbation level shifts. By applying a specific attack on all transformer trackers, we show that new transformer trackers having a stronger cross-attention modeling achieve a greater adversarial robustness on tracking datasets, such as VOT2022ST and GOT10k. Our results also indicate the necessity for new attack methods to effectively tackle the latest types of transformer trackers.

Poster,Reprogramming Pretrained Target-Specific Diffusion Models for Dual-Target Drug Design,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94717,"Xiangxin Zhou, Jiaqi Guan, Yijia Zhang, Xingang Peng, Liang Wang, Jianzhu Ma","Dual-target therapeutic strategies have become a compelling approach and attracted significant attention due to various benefits, such as their potential in overcoming drug resistance in cancer therapy. Considering the tremendous success that deep generative models have achieved in structure-based drug design in recent years, we formulate dual-target drug design as a generative task and curate a novel dataset of potential target pairs based on synergistic drug combinations. We propose to design dual-target drugs with diffusion models that are trained on single-target protein-ligand complex pairs. Specifically, we align two pockets in 3D space with protein-ligand binding priors and build two complex graphs with shared ligand nodes for SE(3)-equivariant composed message passing, based on which we derive a composed drift in both 3D and categorical probability space in the generative process. Our algorithm can well transfer the knowledge gained in single-target pretraining to dual-target scenarios in a zero-shot manner. We also repurpose linker design methods as strong baselines for this task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with various baselines."
Poster,Repurposing Language Models into Embedding Models: Finding the Compute-Optimal Recipe,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93887,"Albert Q. Jiang, Alicja Ziarko, Bartosz Piotrowski, Wenda Li, Mateja Jamnik, Piotr Miłoś","Text embeddings are essential for tasks such as document retrieval, clustering, and semantic similarity assessment. In this paper, we study how to contrastively train text embedding models in a compute-optimal fashion, given a suite of pretrained decoder-only language models. Our innovation is an algorithm that produces optimal configurations of model sizes, data quantities, and fine-tuning methods for text-embedding models at different computational budget levels. The resulting recipe, which we obtain through extensive experiments, can be used by practitioners to make informed design choices for their embedding models. Specifically, our findings suggest that full fine-tuning and Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning produce optimal models at lower and higher computational budgets respectively."
Poster,Reranking Laws for Language Generation: A Communication-Theoretic Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93420,"António Farinhas, Haau-Sing Li, André Martins","To ensure large language models (LLMs) are used safely, one must reduce their propensity to hallucinate or to generate unacceptable answers. A simple and often used strategy is to first let the LLM generate multiple hypotheses and then employ a reranker to choose the best one. In this paper, we draw a parallel between this strategy and the use of redundancy to decrease the error rate in noisy communication channels. We conceptualize the generator as a sender transmitting multiple descriptions of a message through parallel noisy channels. The receiver decodes the message by ranking the (potentially corrupted) descriptions and selecting the one found to be most reliable. We provide conditions under which this protocol is asymptotically error-free (i.e., yields an acceptable answer almost surely) even in scenarios where the reranker is imperfect (governed by Mallows or Zipf-Mandelbrot models) and the channel distributions are statistically dependent. We use our framework to obtain reranking laws which we validate empirically on two real-world tasks using LLMs: text-to-code generation with DeepSeek-Coder 7B and machine translation of medical data with TowerInstruct 13B."
Poster,"[Re] Reproducibility Study of “Explaining Temporal Graph Models Through an Explorer-Navigator Framework""",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/99341,"Helia Ghasemi, Christina Isaicu, Jesse Wonnink, Andreas Berentzen","This paper seeks to reproduce and extend the results of the paper “Explaining Temporal Graph Models Through an Explorer-Navigator Framework” by (Xia et al., 2023). The main contribution of the original authors is a novel explainer for temporal graph networks, the Temporal GNN Explainer (T-GNNExplainer), which finds a subset of preceding events that “explain” a prediction made by a temporal graph model. The explorer is tested on two temporal graph models that are trained on two real-world and two synthetic datasets. The explorer is evaluated using a newly proposed metric for explanatory graph models. The authors compare the performance of their explorer to three baseline explainer methods, either adapted from a GNN explainer or developed by the authors. The authors claim that T-GNNExplainer achieves superior performance compared to the baselines when evaluated with their proposed metric. This work reproduces the original experiments by using the code (with minor adjustments), model specifications, and hyperparameters provided by the original authors. To evaluate the robustness of these claims, the method was extended to one new dataset (MOOC). Results show that the T-GNNexplainer performs best on some, but not all metrics as reported in the original findings. We conclude that the main lines of this paper hold up even though all results are less pronounced than claimed. Results show that the T-GNNExplainer does not perform similarly across different T-GNN models, precise dataset specifications are needed to obtain high performance, and there are simpler, less computationally costly explainer methods (like PBONE) that could offer competitive results."
Poster,ResAD: A Simple Framework for Class Generalizable Anomaly Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92956,"Xincheng Yao, Zixin Chen, Chao Gao, Guangtao Zhai, Chongyang Zhang","This paper explores the problem of class-generalizable anomaly detection, where the objective is to train one unified AD model that can generalize to detect anomalies in diverse classes from different domains without any retraining or fine-tuning on the target data. Because normal feature representations vary significantly across classes, this will cause the widely studied one-for-one AD models to be poorly classgeneralizable (i.e., performance drops dramatically when used for new classes). In this work, we propose a simple but effective framework (called ResAD) that can be directly applied to detect anomalies in new classes. Our main insight is to learn the residual feature distribution rather than the initial feature distribution. In this way, we can significantly reduce feature variations. Even in new classes, the distribution of normal residual features would not remarkably shift from the learned distribution. Therefore, the learned model can be directly adapted to new classes. ResAD consists of three components: (1) a Feature Converter that converts initial features into residual features; (2) a simple and shallow Feature Constraintor that constrains normal residual features into a spatial hypersphere for further reducing feature variations and maintaining consistency in feature scales among different classes; (3) a Feature Distribution Estimator that estimates the normal residual feature distribution, anomalies can be recognized as out-of-distribution. Despite the simplicity, ResAD can achieve remarkable anomaly detection results when directly used in new classes. The code is available at https://github.com/xcyao00/ResAD."
