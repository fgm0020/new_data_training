Poster,A Non-parametric Direct Learning Approach to Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimation under Unmeasured Confounding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94455,"Xinhai Zhang, Xingye Qiao","In many social, behavioral, and biomedical sciences, treatment effect estimation is a crucial step in understanding the impact of an intervention, policy, or treatment. In recent years, an increasing emphasis has been placed on heterogeneity in treatment effects, leading to the development of various methods for estimating Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE). These approaches hinge on a crucial identifying condition of no unmeasured confounding, an assumption that is not always guaranteed in observational studies or randomized control trials with non-compliance. In this paper, we proposed a general framework for estimating CATE with a possible unmeasured confounder using Instrumental Variables. We also construct estimators that exhibit greater efficiency and robustness against various scenarios of model misspecification. The efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated through simulation studies and a real data example."
Poster,A Novel Unified Architecture for Low-Shot Counting by Detection and Segmentation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93724,"Jer Pelhan, Alan Lukezic, Vitjan Zavrtanik, Matej Kristan","Low-shot object counters estimate the number of objects in an image using few or no annotated exemplars. Objects are localized by matching them to prototypes, which are constructed by unsupervised image-wide object appearance aggregation.Due to potentially diverse object appearances, the existing approaches often lead to overgeneralization and false positive detections.Furthermore, the best-performing methods train object localization by a surrogate loss, that predicts a unit Gaussian at each object center. This loss is sensitive to annotation error, hyperparameters and does not directly optimize the detection task, leading to suboptimal counts.We introduce GeCo, a novel low-shot counter that achieves accurate object detection, segmentation, and count estimation in a unified architecture.GeCo robustly generalizes the prototypes across objects appearances through a novel dense object query formulation. In addition, a novel counting loss is proposed, that directly optimizes the detection task and avoids the issues of the standard surrogate loss. GeCo surpasses the leading few-shot detection-based counters by $\sim$25\% in the total count MAE, achieves superior detection accuracy and sets a new solid state-of-the-art result across all low-shot counting setups. The code will be available on GitHub."
Poster,ANT: Adaptive Noise Schedule for Time Series Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96850,"Seunghan Lee, Kibok Lee, Taeyoung Park","Advances in diffusion models for generative artificial intelligence have recently propagated to the time series (TS) domain, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. However, prior works on TS diffusion models often borrow the framework of existing works proposed in other domains without considering the characteristics of TS data, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, wepropose Adaptive Noise schedule for Time series diffusion models (ANT), which automatically predetermines proper noise schedules for given TS datasets based on their statistics representing non-stationarity. Our intuition is that an optimal noise schedule should satisfy the following desiderata: 1) It linearly reduces the non-stationarity of TS data so that all diffusion steps are equally meaningful, 2) the data is corrupted to the random noise at the final step, and 3) the number of steps is sufficiently large. The proposed method is practical for use in that it eliminates the necessity of finding the optimal noise schedule with a small additional cost to compute the statistics for given datasets, which can be done offline before training. We validate the effectiveness of our method across various tasks, including TS forecasting, refinement, and generation, on datasets from diverse domains. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/seunghan96/ANT."
Poster,Antigen-Specific Antibody Design via Direct Energy-based Preference Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95910,"Xiangxin Zhou, Dongyu Xue, Ruizhe Chen, Zaixiang Zheng, Liang Wang, Quanquan Gu","Antibody design, a crucial task with significant implications across various disciplines such as therapeutics and biology, presents considerable challenges due to its intricate nature. In this paper, we tackle antigen-specific antibody sequence-structure co-design as an optimization problem towards specific preferences, considering both rationality and functionality. Leveraging a pre-trained conditional diffusion model that jointly models sequences and structures of antibodies with equivariant neural networks, we propose direct energy-based preference optimization to guide the generation of antibodies with both rational structures and considerable binding affinities to given antigens. Our method involves fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion model using a residue-level decomposed energy preference. Additionally, we employ gradient surgery to address conflicts between various types of energy, such as attraction and repulsion. Experiments on RAbD benchmark show that our approach effectively optimizes the energy of generated antibodies and achieves state-of-the-art performance in designing high-quality antibodies with low total energy and high binding affinity simultaneously, demonstrating the superiority of our approach."
Poster,Any2Graph: Deep End-To-End Supervised Graph Prediction With An Optimal Transport Loss,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93336,"Paul Krzakala, Junjie Yang, Rémi Flamary, Florence d&#x27;Alché-Buc, Charlotte Laclau, Matthieu Labeau","We propose Any2graph, a generic framework for end-to-end Supervised Graph Prediction (SGP) i.e. a deep learning model that predicts an entire graph for any kind of input. The framework is built on a novel Optimal Transport loss, the Partially-Masked Fused Gromov-Wasserstein, that exhibits all necessary properties (permutation invariance, differentiability and scalability) and is designed to handle any-sized graphs. Numerical experiments showcase the versatility of the approach that outperform existing competitors on a novel challenging synthetic dataset and a variety of real-world tasks such as map construction from satellite image (Sat2Graph) or molecule prediction from fingerprint (Fingerprint2Graph)."
Poster,Any2Policy: Learning Visuomotor Policy with Any-Modality,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96353,"Yichen Zhu, Zhicai Ou, Feifei Feng, Jian Tang","Humans can communicate and observe media with different modalities, such as texts, sounds, and images. For robots to be more generalizable embodied agents, they should be capable of following instructions and perceiving the world with adaptation to diverse modalities. Current robotic learning methodologies often focus on single-modal task specification and observation, thereby limiting their ability to process rich multi-modal information. Addressing this limitation, we present an end-to-end general-purpose multi-modal system named Any-to-Policy Embodied Agents. This system empowers robots to handle tasks using various modalities, whether in combinations like text-image, audio-image, text-point cloud, or in isolation. Our innovative approach involves training a versatile modality network that adapts to various inputs and connects with policy networks for effective control. Because of the lack of existing multi-modal robotics datasets for evaluation, we assembled a comprehensive real-world dataset encompassing 30 robotic tasks. Each task in this dataset is richly annotated across multiple modalities, providing a robust foundation for assessment. We conducted extensive validation of our proposed unified modality embodied agent using several simulation benchmarks, including Franka Kitchen, Meta-World, and Maniskill2, as well as in our real-world settings. Our experiments showcase the promising capability of building embodied agents that can adapt to diverse multi-modal in a unified framework."
Poster,AnyFit: Controllable Virtual Try-on for Any Combination of Attire Across Any Scenario,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94439,"Yuhan Li, Hao Zhou, Wenxiang Shang, Ran Lin, Xuanhong Chen, Bingbing Ni","While image-based virtual try-on has made significant strides, emerging approaches still fall short of delivering high-fidelity and robust fitting images across various scenarios, as their models suffer from issues of ill-fitted garment styles and quality degrading during the training process, not to mention the lack of support for various combinations of attire. Therefore, we first propose a lightweight, scalable, operator known as Hydra Block for attire combinations. This is achieved through a parallel attention mechanism that facilitates the feature injection of multiple garments from conditionally encoded branches into the main network. Secondly, to significantly enhance the model's robustness and expressiveness in real-world scenarios, we evolve its potential across diverse settings by synthesizing the residuals of multiple models, as well as implementing a mask region boost strategy to overcome the instability caused by information leakage in existing models. Equipped with the above design, AnyFit surpasses all baselines on high-resolution benchmarks and real-world data by a large gap, excelling in producing well-fitting garments replete with photorealistic and rich details. Furthermore, AnyFit’s impressive performance on high-fidelity virtual try-ons in any scenario from any image, paves a new path for future research within the fashion community."
Poster,AP-Adapter: Improving Generalization of Automatic Prompts on Unseen Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96696,"Yuchen Fu, Zhiwei Jiang, Yuliang Liu, Cong Wang, Zexuan Deng, Zhaoling Chen, Qing Gu","Recent advancements in Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) for text-to-image generation have streamlined user input while ensuring high-quality image output. However, most APO methods are trained assuming a fixed text-to-image model, which is impractical given the emergence of new models. To address this, we propose a novel task, model-generalized automatic prompt optimization (MGAPO), which trains APO methods on a set of known models to enable generalization to unseen models during testing. MGAPO presents significant challenges. First, we experimentally confirm the suboptimal performance of existing APO methods on unseen models. We then introduce a two-stage prompt optimization method, AP-Adapter. In the first stage, a large language model is used to rewrite the prompts. In the second stage, we propose a novel method to construct an enhanced representation space by leveraging inter-model differences. This space captures the characteristics of multiple domain models, storing them as domain prototypes. These prototypes serve as anchors to adjust prompt representations, enabling generalization to unseen models. The optimized prompt representations are subsequently used to generate conditional representations for controllable image generation. We curate a multi-modal, multi-model dataset that includes multiple diffusion models and their corresponding text-image data, and conduct experiments under a model generalization setting. The experimental results demonstrate the AP-Adapter's ability to enable the automatic prompts to generalize well to previously unseen diffusion models, generating high-quality images."
Poster,A Pairwise Pseudo-likelihood Approach for Matrix Completion with Informative Missingness,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94648,"Jiangyuan Li, Jiayi Wang, Raymond K. W. Wong, Kwun Chuen Gary Chan","While several recent matrix completion methods are developed to deal with non-uniform observation probabilities across matrix entries, very few allow the missingness to depend on the mostly unobserved matrix measurements, which is generally ill-posed. We aim to tackle a subclass of these ill-posed settings, characterized by a flexible separable observation probability assumption that can depend on the matrix measurements. We propose a regularized pairwise pseudo-likelihood approach for matrix completion and prove that the proposed estimator can asymptotically recover the low-rank parameter matrix up to an identifiable equivalence class of a constant shift and scaling, at a near-optimal asymptotic convergence rate of the standard well-posed (non-informative missing) setting, while effectively mitigating the impact of informative missingness. The efficacy of our method is validated via numerical experiments, positioning it as a robust tool for matrix completion to mitigate data bias."
Poster,Apathetic or Empathetic? Evaluating LLMs' Emotional Alignments with Humans,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93520,"Jen-Tse Huang, Man Ho LAM, Eric John Li, Shujie Ren, Wenxuan Wang, Wenxiang Jiao, Zhaopeng Tu, Michael R Lyu","Evaluating Large Language Models’ (LLMs) anthropomorphic capabilities has become increasingly important in contemporary discourse. Utilizing the emotion appraisal theory from psychology, we propose to evaluate the empathy ability of LLMs, i.e., how their feelings change when presented with specific situations. After a careful and comprehensive survey, we collect a dataset containing over 400 situations that have proven effective in eliciting the eight emotions central to our study. Categorizing the situations into 36 factors, we conduct a human evaluation involving more than 1,200 subjects worldwide. With the human evaluation results as references, our evaluation includes seven LLMs, covering both commercial and open-source models, including variations in model sizes, featuring the latest iterations, such as GPT-4, Mixtral-8x22B, and LLaMA-3.1. We find that, despite several misalignments, LLMs can generally respond appropriately to certain situations. Nevertheless, they fall short in alignment with the emotional behaviors of human beings and cannot establish connections between similar situations. Our collected dataset of situations, the human evaluation results, and the code of our testing framework, i.e., EmotionBench, are publicly available at https://github.com/CUHK-ARISE/EmotionBench."
