Poster,Towards Multi-dimensional Explanation Alignment for Medical Classification,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96768,"Lijie Hu, Songning Lai, Wenshuo Chen, Hongru Xiao, Hongbin Lin, Lu Yu, Jingfeng ZHANG, Di Wang","The lack of interpretability in the field of medical image analysis has significant ethical and legal implications. Existing interpretable methods in this domain encounter several challenges, including dependency on specific models, difficulties in understanding and visualization, and issues related to efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called Med-MICN (Medical Multi-dimensional Interpretable Concept Network). Med-MICN provides interpretability alignment for various angles, including neural symbolic reasoning, concept semantics, and saliency maps, which are superior to current interpretable methods. Its advantages include high prediction accuracy, interpretability across multiple dimensions, and automation through an end-to-end concept labeling process that reduces the need for extensive human training effort when working with new datasets. To demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of Med-MICN, we apply it to four benchmark datasets and compare it with baselines. The results clearly demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our Med-MICN."
Poster,Towards Multi-Domain Learning for Generalizable Video Anomaly Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92985,"MyeongAh Cho, Taeoh Kim, Minho Shim, Dongyoon Wee, Sangyoun Lee","Most of the existing Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) studies have been conducted within single-domain learning, where training and evaluation are performed on a single dataset. However, the criteria for abnormal events differ across VAD datasets, making it problematic to apply a single-domain model to other domains. In this paper, we propose a new task called Multi-Domain learning forVAD (MDVAD) to explore various real-world abnormal events using multiple datasets for a general model. MDVAD involves training on datasets from multiple domains simultaneously, and we experimentally observe that Abnormal Conflicts between domains hinder learning and generalization. The task aims to address two key objectives: (i) better distinguishing between general normal and abnormal events across multiple domains, and (ii) being aware of ambiguous abnormal conflicts. This paper is the first to tackle abnormal conflict issue and introduces a new benchmark, baselines, and evaluation protocols for MDVAD. As baselines, we propose a framework with Null(Angular)-Multiple Instance Learning and an Abnormal Conflict classifier. Through experiments on a MDVAD benchmark composed of six VAD datasets and using four different evaluation protocols, we reveal abnormal conflicts and demonstrate that the proposed baseline effectively handles these conflicts, showing robustness and adaptability across multiple domains."
Poster,Towards Neuron Attributions in Multi-Modal Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93962,"Junfeng Fang, Zac Bi, Ruipeng Wang, Houcheng Jiang, Yuan Gao, Kun Wang, An Zhang, Jie Shi, Xiang Wang, Tat-Seng Chua","As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, demystifying their internal mechanisms becomes increasingly vital. Neuron attribution, which attributes LLM outputs to specific neurons to reveal the semantic properties they learn, has emerged as a key interpretability approach. However, while neuron attribution has made significant progress in deciphering text-only LLMs, its application to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) remains less explored. To address this gap, we propose a novel Neuron Attribution method tailored for MLLMs, termed NAM. Specifically, NAM not only reveals the modality-specific semantic knowledge learned by neurons within MLLMs, but also highlights several intriguing properties of neurons, such as cross-modal invariance and semantic sensitivity. These properties collectively elucidate the inner workings mechanism of MLLMs, providing a deeper understanding of how MLLMs process and generate multi-modal content. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate the efficacy of NAM and the valuable insights it offers. Furthermore, leveraging NAM, we introduce a multi-modal knowledge editing paradigm, underscoring the practical significance of our approach for downstream applications of MLLMs."
Poster,Towards Next-Generation Logic Synthesis: A Scalable Neural Circuit Generation Framework,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94631,"Zhihai Wang, Jie Wang, Qingyue Yang, Yinqi Bai, Xing Li, Lei Chen, Jianye Hao, Mingxuan Yuan, Bin Li, Yongdong Zhang, Feng Wu","Logic Synthesis (LS) aims to generate an optimized logic circuit satisfying a given functionality, which generally consists of circuit translation and optimization. It is a challenging and fundamental combinatorial optimization problem in integrated circuit design. Traditional LS approaches rely on manually designed heuristics to tackle the LS task, while machine learning recently offers a promising approach towards next-generation logic synthesis by neural circuit generation and optimization. In this paper, we first revisit the application of differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) methods to circuit generation and found from extensive experiments that existing DNAS methods struggle to exactly generate circuits, scale poorly to large circuits, and exhibit high sensitivity to hyper-parameters. Then we provide three major insights for these challenges from extensive empirical analysis: 1) DNAS tends to overfit to too many skip-connections, consequently wasting a significant portion of the network's expressive capabilities; 2) DNAS suffers from the structure bias between the network architecture and the circuit inherent structure, leading to inefficient search; 3) the learning difficulty of different input-output examples varies significantly, leading to severely imbalanced learning. To address these challenges in a systematic way, we propose a novel regularized triangle-shaped circuit network generation framework, which leverages our key insights for completely accurate and scalable circuit generation. Furthermore, we propose an evolutionary algorithm assisted by reinforcement learning agent restarting technique for efficient and effective neural circuit optimization. Extensive experiments on four different circuit benchmarks demonstrate that our method can precisely generate circuits with up to 1200 nodes. Moreover, our synthesized circuits significantly outperform the state-of-the-art results from several competitive winners in IWLS 2022 and 2023 competitions."
Poster,Towards Next-Level Post-Training Quantization of Hyper-Scale Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96493,"Junhan Kim, Chungman Lee, Eulrang Cho, Kyungphil Park, Ho-young Kim, Joonyoung Kim, Yongkweon Jeon","With the increasing complexity of generative AI models, post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a promising solution for deploying hyper-scale models on edge devices such as mobile and TVs.Existing PTQ schemes, however, consume considerable time and resources, which could be a bottleneck in real situations where frequent model updates and multiple hyperparameter tunings are required.As a cost-effective alternative, learning-free PTQ schemes have been proposed. However, the performance is somewhat limited because they cannot consider the inter-layer dependency within the attention module, which is a significant feature of Transformers.In this paper, we thus propose a novel PTQ algorithm that balances accuracy and efficiency.The key idea of the proposed algorithm called aespa is to perform quantization layer-wise for efficiency while targeting attention-wise reconstruction to consider the cross-layer dependency.Through extensive experiments on various language models and complexity analysis, we demonstrate that aespa is accurate and efficient in quantizing Transformer models. The code will be available at https: //github.com/SamsungLabs/aespa."
Poster,Towards Open Respiratory Acoustic Foundation Models: Pretraining and Benchmarking,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97457,"Yuwei Zhang, Tong Xia, Jing Han, Yu Wu, Georgios Rizos, Yang Liu, Mohammed Mosuily, J Ch, Cecilia Mascolo","Respiratory audio, such as coughing and breathing sounds, has predictive power for a wide range of healthcare applications, yet is currently under-explored. The main problem for those applications arises from the difficulty in collecting large labeled task-specific data for model development. Generalizable respiratory acoustic foundation models pretrained with unlabeled data would offer appealing advantages and possibly unlock this impasse.  However, given the safety-critical nature of healthcare applications, it is pivotal to also ensure openness and replicability for any proposed foundation model solution. To this end, we introduce OPERA, an OPEn Respiratory Acoustic foundation model pretraining and benchmarking system, as the first approach answering this need. We curate large-scale respiratory audio datasets ($\sim$136K samples, over 400 hours), pretrain three pioneering foundation models, and build a benchmark consisting of 19 downstream respiratory health tasks for evaluation. Our pretrained models demonstrate superior performance (against existing acoustic models pretrained with general audio on 16 out of 19 tasks) and generalizability (to unseen datasets and new respiratory audio modalities). This highlights the great promise of respiratory acoustic foundation models and encourages more studies using OPERA as an open resource to accelerate research on respiratory audio for health. The system is accessible from https://github.com/evelyn0414/OPERA."
Poster,Towards Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation Without Semantic Labels,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94555,"Heeseong Shin, Chaehyun Kim, Sunghwan Hong, Seokju Cho, Anurag Arnab, Paul Hongsuck Seo, Seungryong Kim","Large-scale vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated impressive open-vocabulary capabilities for image-level tasks, excelling in recognizing what objects are present. However, they struggle with pixel-level recognition tasks like semantic segmentation, which require understanding where the objects are located. In this work, we propose a novel method, PixelCLIP, to adapt the CLIP image encoder for pixel-level understanding by guiding the model on where, which is achieved using unlabeled images and masks generated from vision foundation models such as SAM and DINO. To address the challenges of leveraging masks without semantic labels, we devise an online clustering algorithm using learnable class names to acquire general semantic concepts. PixelCLIP shows significant performance improvements over CLIP and competitive results compared to caption-supervised methods in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation."
Poster,Towards Principled Graph Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95605,"Luis Müller, Daniel Kusuma, Blai Bonet, Christopher Morris","The expressive power of graph learning architectures based on the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman ($k$-WL) hierarchy is well understood. However, such architectures often fail to deliver solid predictive performance on real-world tasks, limiting their practical impact. In contrast, global attention-based models such as graph transformers demonstrate strong performance in practice, but comparing their expressive power with the $k$-WL hierarchy remains challenging, particularly since these architectures rely on positional or structural encodings for their expressivity and predictive performance. To address this, we show that the recently proposed Edge Transformer, a global attention model operating on node pairs instead of nodes, has 3-WL expressive power when provided with the right tokenization. Empirically, we demonstrate that the Edge Transformer surpasses other theoretically aligned architectures regarding predictive performance while not relying on positional or structural encodings."
Poster,Towards Reliable Model Selection for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation: An Empirical Study and A Certified Baseline,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97487,"Dapeng Hu, Romy Luo, Jian Liang, Chuan Sheng Foo","Selecting appropriate hyperparameters is crucial for unlocking the full potential of advanced unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods in unlabeled target domains. Although this challenge remains under-explored, it has recently garnered increasing attention with the proposals of various model selection methods. Reliable model selection should maintain performance across diverse UDA methods and scenarios, especially avoiding highly risky worst-case selections—selecting the model or hyperparameter with the worst performance in the pool.\textit{Are existing model selection methods reliable and versatile enough for different UDA tasks?} In this paper, we provide a comprehensive empirical study involving 8 existing model selection approaches to answer this question. Our evaluation spans 12 UDA methods across 5 diverse UDA benchmarks and 5 popular UDA scenarios.Surprisingly, we find that none of these approaches can effectively avoid the worst-case selection. In contrast, a simple but overlooked ensemble-based selection approach, which we call EnsV, is both theoretically and empirically certified to avoid the worst-case selection, ensuring high reliability. Additionally, EnsV is versatile for various practical but challenging UDA scenarios, including validation of open-partial-set UDA and source-free UDA.Finally, we call for more attention to the reliability of model selection in UDA: avoiding the worst-case is as significant as achieving peak selection performance and should not be overlooked when developing new model selection methods.

Poster,Towards Robust Multimodal Sentiment Analysis with Incomplete Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93751,"Haoyu Zhang, Wenbin Wang, Tianshu Yu","The field of Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) has recently witnessed an emerging direction seeking to tackle the issue of data incompleteness. Recognizing that the language modality typically contains dense sentiment information, we consider it as the dominant modality and present an innovative Language-dominated Noise-resistant Learning Network (LNLN) to achieve robust MSA. The proposed LNLN features a dominant modality correction (DMC) module and dominant modality based multimodal learning (DMML) module, which enhances the model's robustness across various noise scenarios by ensuring the quality of dominant modality representations. Aside from the methodical design, we perform comprehensive experiments under random data missing scenarios, utilizing diverse and meaningful settings on several popular datasets (e.g., MOSI, MOSEI, and SIMS), providing additional uniformity, transparency, and fairness compared to existing evaluations in the literature. Empirically, LNLN consistently outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating superior performance across these challenging and extensive evaluation metrics."
