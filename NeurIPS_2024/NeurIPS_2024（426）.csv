Poster,Understanding the Limits of Vision Language Models Through the Lens of the Binding Problem,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95266,"Declan Campbell, Sunayana Rane, Tyler Giallanza, Camillo Nicolò De Sabbata, Kia Ghods, Amogh Joshi, Alexander Ku, Steven Frankland, Tom Griffiths, Jonathan D Cohen, Taylor Webb","Recent work has documented striking heterogeneity in the performance of state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), including both multimodal language models and text-to-image models. These models are able to describe and generate a diverse array of complex, naturalistic images, yet they exhibit surprising failures on basic multi-object reasoning tasks -- such as counting, localization, and simple forms of visual analogy -- that humans perform with near perfect accuracy. To better understand this puzzling pattern of successes and failures, we turn to theoretical accounts of the binding problem in cognitive science and neuroscience, a fundamental problem that arises when a shared set of representational resources must be used to represent distinct entities (e.g., to represent multiple objects in an image), necessitating the use of serial processing to avoid interference. We find that many of the puzzling failures of state-of-the-art VLMs can be explained as arising due to the binding problem, and that these failure modes are strikingly similar to the limitations exhibited by rapid, feedforward processing in the human brain."
Poster,Understanding the Role of Equivariance in Self-supervised Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95444,"Yifei Wang, Kaiwen Hu, Sharut Gupta, Ziyu Ye, Yisen Wang, Stefanie Jegelka","Contrastive learning has been a leading paradigm for self-supervised learning, but it is widely observed that it comes at the price of sacrificing useful features (\eg colors) by being invariant to data augmentations. Given this limitation, there has been a surge of interest in equivariant self-supervised learning (E-SSL) that learns features to be augmentation-aware. However, even for the simplest rotation prediction method, there is a lack of rigorous understanding of why, when, and how E-SSL learns useful features for downstream tasks. To bridge this gap between practice and theory, we establish an information-theoretic perspective to understand the generalization ability of E-SSL. In particular, we identify a critical explaining-away effect in E-SSL that creates a synergy between the equivariant and classification tasks. This synergy effect encourages models to extract class-relevant features to improve its equivariant prediction, which, in turn, benefits downstream tasks requiring semantic features. Based on this perspective, we theoretically analyze the influence of data transformations and reveal several principles for practical designs of E-SSL. Our theory not only aligns well with existing E-SSL methods but also sheds light on new directions by exploring the benefits of model equivariance. We believe that a theoretically grounded understanding on the role of equivariance would inspire more principled and advanced designs in this field.

Poster,Understanding the Transferability of Representations via Task-Relatedness,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96511,"Akshay Mehra, Yunbei Zhang, Jihun Hamm","The growing popularity of transfer learning due to the availability of models pre-trained on vast amounts of data, makes it imperative to understand when the knowledge of these pre-trained models can be transferred to obtain high-performing models on downstream target tasks. However, the exact conditions under which transfer learning succeeds in a cross-domain cross-task setting are still poorly understood. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel analysis that analyzes the transferability of the representations of pre-trained models to downstream tasks in terms of their relatedness to a given reference task. Our analysis leads to an upper bound on transferability in terms of task-relatedness, quantified using the difference between the class priors, label sets, and features of the two tasks.Our experiments using state-of-the-art pre-trained models show the effectiveness of task-relatedness in explaining transferability on various vision and language tasks. The efficient computability of task-relatedness even without labels of the target task and its high correlation with the model's accuracy after end-to-end fine-tuning on the target task makes it a useful metric for transferability estimation. Our empirical results of using task-relatedness on the problem of selecting the best pre-trained model from a model zoo for a target task highlight its utility for practical problems."
Poster,Understanding Transformer Reasoning Capabilities via Graph Algorithms,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96239,"Clayton Sanford, Bahare Fatemi, Ethan Hall, Anton Tsitsulin, Mehran Kazemi, Jonathan Halcrow, Bryan Perozzi, Vahab Mirrokni","Which transformer scaling regimes are able to perfectly solve different classes of algorithmic problems?   While tremendous empirical advances have been attained by transformer-based neural networks, a theoretical understanding of their algorithmic reasoning capabilities in realistic parameter regimes is lacking.  We investigate this question in terms of the network’s depth, width, and number of extra tokens for algorithm execution.  Our novel representational hierarchy separates 9 algorithmic reasoning problems into classes solvable by transformers in different realistic parameter scaling regimes.  We prove that logarithmic depth is necessary and sufficient for tasks like graph connectivity, while single-layer transformers with small embedding dimensions can solve contextual retrieval tasks. We also support our theoretical analysis with ample empirical evidence using the GraphQA benchmark.  These results show that transformers excel at many graph reasoning tasks, even outperforming specialized graph neural networks."
Poster,Understanding Transformers via N-Gram Statistics,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94849,Timothy Nguyen,"Transformer based large-language models (LLMs) display extreme proficiency with language yet a precise understanding of how they work remains elusive. One way of demystifying transformer predictions would be to describe how they depend on their context in terms of simple template functions. This paper takes a first step in this direction by considering families of functions (i.e. rules) formed out of simple N-gram based statistics of the training data. By studying how well these rulesets approximate transformer predictions, we obtain a variety of novel discoveries: a simple method to detect overfitting during training without using a holdout set, a quantitative measure of how transformers progress from learning simple to more complex statistical rules over the course of training, a model-variance criterion governing when transformer predictions tend to be described by N-gram rules, and insights into how well transformers can be approximated by N-gram rulesets in the limit where these rulesets become increasingly complex. In this latter direction, we find that for 79% and 68% of LLM next-token distributions on TinyStories and Wikipedia, respectively, their top-1 predictions agree with those provided by our N-gram rulesets."
Poster,Understanding Visual Feature Reliance through the Lens of Complexity,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95422,"Thomas Fel, Louis Béthune, Andrew Lampinen, Thomas Serre, Katherine Hermann","Recent studies suggest that deep learning models' inductive bias towards favoring simpler features may be an origin of shortcut learning. Yet, there has been limited focus on understanding the complexities of the myriad features that models learn. In this work, we introduce a new metric for quantifying feature complexity, based on V-information and capturing whether a feature requires complex computational transformations to be extracted. Using this V-information metric, we analyze the complexities of 10,000 features—represented as directions in the penultimate layer—that were extracted from a standard ImageNet-trained vision model. Our study addresses four key questions:First, we ask what features look like as a function of complexity, and find a spectrum of simple-to-complex features present within the model. Second, we ask when features are learned during training. We find that simpler features dominate early in training, and more complex features emerge gradually. Third, we investigate where within the network simple and complex features ""flow,"" and find that simpler features tend to bypass the visual hierarchy via residual connections. Fourth, we explore the connection between features' complexity and their importance for driving the network's decision. We find that complex features tend to be less important. Surprisingly, important features become accessible at earlier layers during training, like a ""sedimentation process,"" allowing the model to build upon these foundational elements."
Poster,Unelicitable Backdoors via Cryptographic Transformer Circuits,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94589,"Andis Draguns, Andrew Gritsevskiy, Sumeet Motwani, Christian Schroeder de Witt","The rapid proliferation of open-source language models significantly increases the risks of downstream backdoor attacks. These backdoors can introduce dangerous behaviours during model deployment and can evade detection by conventional cybersecurity monitoring systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of backdoors in transformer models, that, in contrast to prior art, are unelicitable in nature. Unelicitability prevents the defender from triggering the backdoor, making it impossible to properly evaluate ahead of deployment even if given full white-box access and using automated techniques, such as red-teaming or certain formal verification methods. We show that our novel construction is not only unelicitable thanks to using cryptographic techniques, but also has favourable robustness properties.We confirm these properties in empirical investigations, and provide evidence that our backdoors can withstand state-of-the-art mitigation strategies. Additionally, we expand on previous work by showing that our universal backdoors, while not completely undetectable in white-box settings, can be harder to detect than some existing designs. By demonstrating the feasibility of seamlessly integrating backdoors into transformer models, this paper fundamentally questions the efficacy of pre-deployment detection strategies. This offers new insights into the offence-defence balance in AI safety and security."
Poster,UniAR: A Unified model for predicting human Attention and Responses on visual content,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95950,"Peizhao Li, Junfeng He, Gang Li, Rachit Bhargava, Shaolei Shen, Nachiappan Valliappan, Youwei Liang, Hongxiang Gu, Venky Ramachandran, Golnaz farhadi, Yang Li, Kai Kohlhoff, Vidhya Navalpakkam","Progress in human behavior modeling involves understanding both implicit, early-stage perceptual behavior, such as human attention, and explicit, later-stage behavior, such as subjective preferences or likes. Yet most prior research has focused on modeling implicit and explicit human behavior in isolation; and often limited to a specific type of visual content. We propose UniAR -- a unified model of human attention and preference behavior across diverse visual content. UniAR leverages a multimodal transformer to predict subjective feedback, such as satisfaction or aesthetic quality, along with the underlying human attention or interaction heatmaps and viewing order. We train UniAR on diverse public datasets spanning natural images, webpages, and graphic designs, and achieve SOTA performance on multiple benchmarks across various image domains and behavior modeling tasks. Potential applications include providing instant feedback on the effectiveness of UIs/visual content, and enabling designers and content-creation models to optimize their creation for human-centric improvements."
Poster,UniAudio 1.5: Large Language Model-Driven Audio Codec is A Few-Shot Audio Task Learner,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95454,"Dongchao Yang, Haohan Guo, Yuanyuan Wang, Rongjie Huang, Xiang Li, Xu Tan, Xixin Wu, Helen Meng","Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated supreme capabilities in textual understanding and generation, but cannot be directly applied to cross-modal tasks without fine-tuning. This paper proposes a cross-modal in-context learning approach, empowering the frozen LLMs to achieve multiple audio tasks in a few-shot style without any parameter update. Specifically, we propose a novel LLM-driven audio codec model, LLM-Codec, which transfers the audio modality into textual space by representing audio tokens with words or sub-words from the LLM vocabulary, while maintaining high audio reconstruction quality.The key idea is to reduce the modality heterogeneity between text and audio by compressing the audio modality into the well-trained textual space of LLMs. Thus, the audio representation can be viewed as a new \textit{foreign language}, and LLMs can learn the new \textit{foreign language} with several demonstrations. In experiments, we investigate the performance of the proposed approach across multiple audio understanding and generation tasks, \textit{e.g.} speech emotion classification, audio classification, text-to-speech generation, speech enhancement, etc. Experimental results show that LLMs equipped with the LLM-Codec, named as UniAudio 1.5, prompted by only a few examples, can perform effectively in simple scenarios, validating our cross-modal in-context learning approach.To facilitate research on few-shot audio task learning and multi-modal LLMs, we have open-sourced the LLM-Codec model."
Poster,UniBench: Visual Reasoning Requires Rethinking Vision-Language Beyond Scaling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97581,"Haider Al-Tahan, Quentin Garrido, Randall Balestriero, Diane Bouchacourt, Caner Hazirbas, Mark Ibrahim","Significant research efforts have been made to scale and improve vision-language model (VLM) training approaches. Yet, with an ever-growing number of benchmarks,researchers are tasked with the heavy burden of implementing each protocol, bearing a non-trivial computational cost, and making sense of how all these benchmarks translate into meaningful axes of progress.To facilitate a systematic evaluation of VLM progress, we introduce UniBench: a unified implementation of 50+ VLM benchmarks spanning a range of carefully categorized vision-centric capabilities from object recognition to spatial awareness, counting, and much more. We showcase the utility of UniBench for measuring progress by evaluating nearly 60 publicly available vision-language models, trained on scales of up to 12.8B samples. We find that while scaling training data or model size can boost many vision-language model capabilities, scaling offers little benefit for reasoning or relations.  Surprisingly, we also discover today's best VLMs struggle on simple digit recognition and counting tasks, e.g. MNIST, which much simpler networks can solve. Where scale falls short, we find that more precise interventions, such as data quality or tailored-learning objectives offer more promise. For practitioners, we also offer guidance on selecting a suitable VLM for a given application. Finally, we release an easy-to-run UniBench code-base with the full set of 50+ benchmarks and comparisons across 59 models as well as a distilled, representative set of benchmarks that runs in 5 minutes on a single GPU. UniBench with model evaluations on all benchmarks are provided as a toolbox at: https://github.com/facebookresearch/unibench"
