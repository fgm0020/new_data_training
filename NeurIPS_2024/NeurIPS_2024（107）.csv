Poster,DiffusionPDE: Generative PDE-Solving under Partial Observation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92980,"Jiahe Huang, Guandao Yang, Zichen Wang, Jeong Joon Park","We introduce a general framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using generative diffusion models. In particular, we focus on the scenarios where we do not have the full knowledge of the scene necessary to apply classical solvers. Most existing forward or inverse PDE approaches perform poorly when the observations on the data or the underlying coefficients are incomplete, which is a common assumption for real-world measurements. In this work, we propose DiffusionPDE that can simultaneously fill in the missing information and solve a PDE by modeling the joint distribution of the solution and coefficient spaces. We show that the learned generative priors lead to a versatile framework for accurately solving a wide range of PDEs under partial observation, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art methods for both forward and inverse directions."
Poster,Diffusion PID: Interpreting Diffusion via Partial Information Decomposition,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94580,"Shaurya Dewan, Rushikesh Zawar, Prakanshul Saxena, Yingshan CHANG, Andrew Luo, Yonatan Bisk","Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in generating naturalistic images from textual inputs, and demonstrate the capacity to learn and represent complex visual-semantic relationships. While these diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, the underlying mechanisms driving their performance are not yet fully accounted for, with many unanswered questions surrounding what they learn, how they represent visual-semantic relationships, and why they sometimes fail to generalize. Our work presents Diffusion Partial Information Decomposition (DiffusionPID), a novel technique that applies information-theoretic principles to decompose the input text prompt into its elementary components, enabling a detailed examination of how individual tokens and their interactions shape the generated image. We introduce a formal approach to analyze the uniqueness, redundancy, and synergy terms by applying PID to the denoising model at both the image and pixel level. This approach enables us to characterize how individual tokens and their interactions affect the model output. We first present a fine-grained analysis of characteristics utilized by the model to uniquely localize specific concepts, we then apply our approach in bias analysis and show it can recover gender and ethnicity biases. Finally, we use our method to visually characterize word ambiguity and similarity from the model’s perspective and illustrate the efficacy of our method for prompt intervention. Our results show that PID is a potent tool for evaluating and diagnosing text-to-image diffusion models. Link to project page: https://rbz-99.github.io/Diffusion-PID/."
Poster,Diffusion Policies Creating a Trust Region for Offline Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96485,"Tianyu Chen, Zhendong Wang, Mingyuan Zhou","Offline reinforcement learning (RL) leverages pre-collected datasets to train optimal policies. Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL), introducing diffusion models as a powerful and expressive policy class, significantly boosts the performance of offline RL. However, its reliance on iterative denoising sampling to generate actions slows down both training and inference. While several recent attempts have tried to accelerate diffusion-QL, the improvement in training and/or inference speed often results in degraded performance. In this paper, we introduce a dual policy approach, Diffusion Trusted Q-Learning (DTQL), which comprises a diffusion policy for pure behavior cloning and a practical one-step policy. We bridge the two polices by a newly introduced diffusion trust region loss. The diffusion policy maintains expressiveness, while the trust region loss directs the one-step policy to explore freely and seek modes within the region defined by the diffusion policy. DTQL eliminates the need for iterative denoising sampling during both training and inference, making it remarkably computationally efficient. We evaluate its effectiveness and algorithmic characteristics against popular Kullback-Leibler (KL) based distillation methods in 2D bandit scenarios and gym tasks. We then show that DTQL could not only outperform other methods on the majority of the D4RL benchmark tasks but also demonstrate efficiency in training and inference speeds. The PyTorch implementation is available at https://github.com/TianyuCodings/Diffusion_Trusted_Q_Learning."
Poster,Diffusion Policy Attacker: Crafting Adversarial Attacks for Diffusion-based Policies,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96871,"Yipu Chen, Haotian Xue, Yongxin Chen","Diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for behavior cloning (BC), leveraging their exceptional ability to model multi-modal distributions. Diffusion policies (DP) have elevated BC performance to new heights, demonstrating robust efficacy across diverse tasks, coupled with their inherent flexibility and ease of implementation. Despite the increasing adoption of Diffusion Policies (DP) as a foundation for policy generation, the critical issue of safety remains largely unexplored. While previous attempts have targeted deep policy networks, DP used diffusion models as the policy network, making it ineffective to be attacked using previous methods because of its chained structure and randomness injected. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive examination of DP safety concerns by introducing adversarial scenarios, encompassing offline and online attacks, global and patch-based attacks. We propose DP-Attacker, a suite of algorithms that can craft effective adversarial attacks across all aforementioned scenarios. We conduct attacks on pre-trained diffusion policies across various manipulation tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DP-Attacker has the capability to significantly decrease the success rate of DP for all scenarios. Particularly in offline scenarios, we exhibit the generation of highly transferable perturbations applicable to all frames. Furthermore, we illustrate the creation of adversarial physical patches that, when applied to the environment, effectively deceive the model.

Poster,Diffusion Priors for Variational Likelihood Estimation and Image Denoising,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95341,"Jun Cheng, Shan Tan","Real-world noise removal is crucial in low-level computer vision. Due to the remarkable generation capabilities of diffusion models, recent attention has shifted towards leveraging diffusion priors for image restoration tasks. However, existing diffusion priors-based methods either consider simple noise types or rely on approximate posterior estimation, limiting their effectiveness in addressing structured and signal-dependent noise commonly found in real-world images. In this paper, we build upon diffusion priors and propose adaptive likelihood estimation and MAP inference during the reverse diffusion process to tackle real-world noise. We introduce an independent, non-identically distributed likelihood combined with the noise precision (inverse variance) prior and dynamically infer the precision posterior using variational Bayes during the generation process. Meanwhile, we rectify the estimated noise variance through local Gaussian convolution. The final denoised image is obtained by propagating intermediate MAP solutions that balance the updated likelihood and diffusion prior. Additionally, we explore the local diffusion prior inherent in low-resolution diffusion models, enabling direct handling of high-resolution noisy images. Extensive experiments and analyses on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code is available at https://github.com/HUST-Tan/DiffusionVI."
Poster,Diffusion-Reward Adversarial Imitation Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93914,"Chun-Mao Lai, Hsiang-Chun Wang, Ping-Chun Hsieh, Frank Wang, Min-Hung Chen, Shao-Hua Sun","Imitation learning aims to learn a policy from observing expert demonstrations without access to reward signals from environments. Generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) formulates imitation learning as adversarial learning, employing a generator policy learning to imitate expert behaviors and discriminator learning to distinguish the expert demonstrations from agent trajectories. Despite its encouraging results, GAIL training is often brittle and unstable. Inspired by the recent dominance of diffusion models in generative modeling, we propose Diffusion-Reward Adversarial Imitation Learning (DRAIL), which integrates a diffusion model into GAIL, aiming to yield more robust and smoother rewards for policy learning. Specifically, we propose a diffusion discriminative classifier to construct an enhanced discriminator, and design diffusion rewards based on the classifier’s output for policy learning. Extensive experiments are conducted in navigation, manipulation, and locomotion, verifying DRAIL’s effectiveness compared to prior imitation learning methods. Moreover, additional experimental results demonstrate the generalizability and data efficiency of DRAIL. Visualized learned reward functions of GAIL and DRAIL suggest that DRAIL can produce more robust and smoother rewards. Project page: https://nturobotlearninglab.github.io/DRAIL/"
Poster,Diffusion Spectral Representation for Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96164,"Dmitry Shribak, Chen-Xiao Gao, Yitong Li, Chenjun Xiao, Bo Dai","Diffusion-based models have achieved notable empirical successes in reinforcement learning (RL) due to their expressiveness in modeling complex distributions. Despite existing methods being promising, the key challenge of extending existing methods for broader real-world applications lies in the computational cost at inference time, i.e., sampling from a diffusion model is considerably slow as it often requires tens to hundreds of iterations to generate even one sample. To circumvent this issue, we propose to leverage the flexibility of diffusion models for RL from a representation learning perspective. In particular, by exploiting the connection between diffusion models and energy-based models, we develop Diffusion Spectral Representation (Diff-SR), a coherent algorithm framework that enables extracting sufficient representations for value functions in Markov decision processes (MDP) and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDP). We further demonstrate how Diff-SR facilitates efficient policy optimization and practical algorithms while explicitly bypassing the difficulty and inference cost of sampling from the diffusion model. Finally, we provide comprehensive empirical studies to verify the benefits of Diff-SR in delivering robust and advantageous performance across various benchmarks with both fully and partially observable settings."
Poster,Diffusion Tuning: Transferring Diffusion Models via Chain of Forgetting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95124,"Jincheng Zhong, Xingzhuo Guo, Jiaxiang Dong, Mingsheng Long","Diffusion models have significantly advanced the field of generative modeling. However, training a diffusion model is computationally expensive, creating a pressing need to adapt off-the-shelf diffusion models for downstream generation tasks. Current fine-tuning methods focus on parameter-efficient transfer learning but overlook the fundamental transfer characteristics of diffusion models.  In this paper, we investigate the transferability of diffusion models and observe a monotonous chain of forgetting trend of transferability along the reverse process. Based on this observation and novel theoretical insights, we present Diff-Tuning, a frustratingly simple transfer approach that leverages the chain of forgetting tendency. Diff-Tuning encourages the fine-tuned model to retain the pre-trained knowledge at the end of the denoising chain close to the generated data while discarding the other noise side.  We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate Diff-Tuning, including the transfer of pre-trained Diffusion Transformer models to eight downstream generations and the adaptation of Stable Diffusion to five control conditions with ControlNet.  Diff-Tuning achieves a 24.6% improvement over standard fine-tuning and enhances the convergence speed of ControlNet by 24%. Notably, parameter-efficient transfer learning techniques for diffusion models can also benefit from Diff-Tuning. Code  is available at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/Diffusion-Tuning."
Poster,Diffusion Twigs with Loop Guidance for Conditional Graph Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94177,"Giangiacomo Mercatali, Yogesh Verma, Andre Freitas, Vikas Garg","We introduce a novel score-based diffusion framework named  Twigs that incorporates multiple co-evolving flows for enriching conditional generation tasks. Specifically, a central or trunk diffusion process is associated with a primary variable (e.g., graph structure), and additional offshoot or  stem processes are dedicated to dependent variables (e.g., graph properties or labels). A new strategy, which we call loop guidance, effectively orchestrates the flow of information between the trunk and the stem processes during sampling. This approach allows us to uncover intricate interactions and dependencies, and unlock new generative capabilities. We provide extensive experiments to demonstrate strong performance gains of the proposed method over contemporary baselines in the context of conditional graph generation, underscoring the potential of Twigs in challenging generative tasks such as inverse molecular design and molecular optimization.

Poster,DigiRL: Training In-The-Wild Device-Control Agents with Autonomous Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96658,"Hao Bai, Yifei Zhou, Jiayi Pan, Mert Cemri, Alane Suhr, Sergey Levine, Aviral Kumar","Pre-trained vision language models (VLMs), though powerful, typically lack training on decision-centric data, rendering them sub-optimal for decision-making tasks such as in-the-wild device control through Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) when used off-the-shelf. While training with static demonstrations has shown some promise, we show that such methods fall short when controlling real GUIs due to their failure to deal with real world stochasticity and dynamism not captured in static observational data. This paper introduces a novel autonomous RL approach, called DigiRL, for training in-the-wild device control agents through fine-tuning a pre-trained VLM in two stages: offline and offline-to-online RL. We first build a scalable and parallelizable Android learning environment equipped with a VLM-based general-purpose evaluator and then identify the key design choices for simple and effective RL in this domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DigiRL using the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) dataset, where our 1.5B VLM trained with RL achieves a 49.5\% absolute improvement -- from 17.7 to 67.2\% success rate -- over supervised fine-tuning with static human demonstration data. It is worth noting that such improvement is achieved without any additional supervision or demonstration data. These results significantly surpass not only the prior best agents, including AppAgent with GPT-4V (8.3\% success rate) and the 17B CogAgent trained with AitW data (14.4\%), but also our implementation of prior best autonomous RL approach based on filtered behavior cloning (57.8\%), thereby establishing a new state-of-the-art for digital agents for in-the-wild device control."
