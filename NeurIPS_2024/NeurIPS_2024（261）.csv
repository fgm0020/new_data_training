Poster,MoGU: A Framework for Enhancing Safety of LLMs While Preserving Their Usability,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95073,"YANRUI DU, Sendong Zhao, Danyang Zhao, Ming Ma, Yuhan Chen, Liangyu Huo, Qing Yang, Dongliang Xu, Bing Qin","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in various applications. As their usage grows, concerns regarding their safety are rising, especially in maintaining harmless responses when faced with malicious instructions. Many defense strategies have been developed to enhance the safety of LLMs. However, our research finds that existing defense strategies lead LLMs to predominantly adopt a rejection-oriented stance, thereby diminishing the usability of their responses to benign instructions. To solve this problem, we introduce the MoGU framework, designed to enhance LLMs' safety while preserving their usability. Our MoGU framework transforms the base LLM into two variants: the usable LLM and the safe LLM, and further employs dynamic routing to balance their contribution. When encountering malicious instructions, the router will assign a higher weight to the safe LLM to ensure that responses are harmless. Conversely, for benign instructions, the router prioritizes the usable LLM, facilitating usable and helpful responses. On various open-sourced LLMs, we compare multiple defense strategies to verify the superiority of our MoGU framework. Besides, our analysis provides key insights into the effectiveness of MoGU and verifies that our designed routing mechanism can effectively balance the contribution of each variant by assigning weights. Our work released the safer Llama2, Vicuna, Falcon, Dolphin, and Baichuan2."
Poster,Molecule Design by Latent Prompt Transformer,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94326,"Deqian Kong, Yuhao Huang, Jianwen Xie, Edouardo Honig, Ming Xu, Shuanghong Xue, Pei Lin, Sanping Zhou, Sheng Zhong, Nanning Zheng, Ying Nian Wu","This work explores the challenging problem of molecule design by framing it as a conditional generative modeling task, where target biological properties or desired chemical constraints serve as conditioning variables.We propose the Latent Prompt Transformer (LPT), a novel generative model comprising three components: (1) a latent vector with a learnable prior distribution modeled by a neural transformation of Gaussian white noise; (2) a molecule generation model based on a causal Transformer, which uses the latent vector as a prompt; and (3) a property prediction model that predicts a molecule's target properties and/or constraint values using the latent prompt. LPT can be learned by maximum likelihood estimation on molecule-property pairs. During property optimization, the latent prompt is inferred from target properties and constraints through posterior sampling and then used to guide the autoregressive molecule generation.After initial training on existing molecules and their properties, we adopt an online learning algorithm to progressively shift the model distribution towards regions that support desired target properties. Experiments demonstrate that LPT not only effectively discovers useful molecules across single-objective, multi-objective, and structure-constrained optimization tasks, but also exhibits strong sample efficiency."
Poster,Molecule Generation with Fragment Retrieval Augmentation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96613,"Seul Lee, Karsten Kreis, Srimukh Veccham, Meng Liu, Danny Reidenbach, Saee Paliwal, Arash Vahdat, Weili Nie","Fragment-based drug discovery, in which molecular fragments are assembled into new molecules with desirable biochemical properties, has achieved great success. However, many fragment-based molecule generation methods show limited exploration beyond the existing fragments in the database as they only reassemble or slightly modify the given ones. To tackle this problem, we propose a new fragment-based molecule generation framework with retrieval augmentation, namely *Fragment Retrieval-Augmented Generation* (*f*-RAG). *f*-RAG is based on a pre-trained molecular generative model that proposes additional fragments from input fragments to complete and generate a new molecule. Given a fragment vocabulary, *f*-RAG retrieves two types of fragments: (1) *hard fragments*, which serve as building blocks that will be explicitly included in the newly generated molecule, and (2) *soft fragments*, which serve as reference to guide the generation of new fragments through a trainable *fragment injection module*. To extrapolate beyond the existing fragments, *f*-RAG updates the fragment vocabulary with generated fragments via an iterative refinement process which is further enhanced with post-hoc genetic fragment modification. *f*-RAG can achieve an improved exploration-exploitation trade-off by maintaining a pool of fragments and expanding it with novel and high-quality fragments through a strong generative prior."
Poster,MoLE: Enhancing Human-centric Text-to-image Diffusion via Mixture of  Low-rank Experts,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94763,"Jie Zhu, Yixiong Chen, Mingyu Ding, Ping Luo, Leye Wang, Jingdong Wang","Text-to-image diffusion has attracted vast attention due to its impressive image-generation capabilities. However, when it comes to human-centric text-to-image generation, particularly in the context of faces and hands, the results often fall short of naturalness due to insufficient training priors. We alleviate the issue in this work from two perspectives. 1) From the data aspect, we carefully collect a human-centric dataset comprising over one million high-quality human-in-the-scene images and two specific sets of close-up images of faces and hands. These datasets collectively provide a rich prior knowledge base to enhance the human-centric image generation capabilities of the diffusion model. 2) On the methodological front, we propose a simple yet effective method called Mixture of Low-rank Experts (MoLE) by considering low-rank modules trained on close-up hand and face images respectively as experts. This concept draws inspiration from our observation of low-rank refinement, where a low-rank module trained by a customized close-up dataset has the potential to enhance the corresponding image part when applied at an appropriate scale. To validate the superiority of MoLE in the context of human-centric image generation compared to state-of-the-art, we construct two benchmarks and perform evaluations with diverse metrics and human studies.

Poster,MoME: Mixture of Multimodal Experts for Generalist Multimodal Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94738,"Leyang Shen, Gongwei Chen, Rui Shao, Weili Guan, Liqiang Nie","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various vision-language tasks. However, a generalist MLLM typically underperforms compared with a specialist MLLM on most VL tasks, which can be attributed to task interference. In this paper, we propose a mixture of multimodal experts (MoME) to mitigate task interference and obtain a generalist MLLM. Our MoME is composed of two key components, a mixture of vision experts (MoVE) and a mixture of language experts (MoLE). MoVE can adaptively modulate the features transformed from various vision encoders, and has a strong compatibility in transformation architecture. MoLE incorporates sparsely gated experts into LLMs to achieve painless improvements with roughly unchanged inference costs. In response to task interference, our MoME specializes in both vision and language modality to adapt to task discrepancies. Extensive experiments show that MoME significantly improves the performance of generalist MLLMs across various VL tasks."
Poster,MomentumSMoE: Integrating Momentum into Sparse Mixture of Experts,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93039,"Rachel S.Y. Teo, Tan Nguyen","Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has become the key to unlocking unparalleled scalability in deep learning. SMoE has the potential to exponentially increase in parameter count while maintaining the efficiency of the model by only activating a small subset of these parameters for a given sample. However, it has been observed that SMoE suffers from unstable training and has difficulty adapting to new distributions, leading to the model's lack of robustness to data contamination. To overcome these limitations, we first establish a connection between the dynamics of the expert representations in SMoEs and gradient descent on a multi-objective optimization problem. Leveraging our framework, we then integrate momentum into SMoE and propose a new family of SMoEs, named MomentumSMoE. We theoretically prove and numerically validate that MomentumSMoE is more stable and robust than SMoE. In particular, we verify the advantages of MomentumSMoE over SMoE on a variety of practical tasks including ImageNet-1K object recognition and WikiText-103 language modeling. We demonstrate the applicability of MomentumSMoE to many types of SMoE models, including those in the Sparse MoE model for vision (V-MoE) and the Generalist Language Model (GLaM). We also show that other advanced momentum-based optimization methods, such as Adam, can be easily incorporated into the MomentumSMoE framework for designing new SMoE models with even better performance, almost negligible additional computation cost, and simple implementations."
Poster,MoMu-Diffusion: On Learning Long-Term Motion-Music Synchronization and Correspondence,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94669,"Fuming You, Minghui Fang, Li Tang, Rongjie Huang, Yongqi Wang, Zhou Zhao","Motion-to-music and music-to-motion have been studied separately, each attracting substantial research interest within their respective domains. The interaction between human motion and music is a reflection of advanced human intelligence, and establishing a unified relationship between them is particularly important. However, to date, there has been no work that considers them jointly to explore the modality alignment within. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework, termed MoMu-Diffusion, for long-term and synchronous motion-music generation. Firstly, to mitigate the huge computational costs raised by long sequences, we propose a novel Bidirectional Contrastive Rhythmic Variational Auto-Encoder (BiCoR-VAE) that extracts the modality-aligned latent representations for both motion and music inputs. Subsequently, leveraging the aligned latent spaces, we introduce a multi-modal diffusion Transformer model and a cross-guidance sampling strategy to enable various generation tasks, including cross-modal, multi-modal, and variable-length generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoMu-Diffusion surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, and can synthesize realistic, diverse, long-term, and beat-matched music or motion sequences. The generated motion-music samples are available at https://momu-diffusion.github.io/."
Poster,MonkeySee: Space-time-resolved reconstructions of natural images from macaque multi-unit activity,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95362,"Lynn Le, Paolo Papale, Katja Seeliger, Antonio Lozano, Thirza Dado, Feng Wang, Pieter Roelfsema, Marcel A. J. van Gerven, Yağmur Güçlütürk, Umut Güçlü","In this paper, we reconstruct naturalistic images directly from macaque brain signals using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based decoder. We investigate the ability of this CNN-based decoding technique to differentiate among neuronal populations from areas V1, V4, and IT, revealing distinct readout characteristics for each. This research marks a progression from low-level to high-level brain signals, thereby enriching the existing framework for utilizing CNN-based decoders to decode brain activity. Our results demonstrate high-precision reconstructions of naturalistic images, highlighting the efficiency of CNN-based decoders in advancing our knowledge of how the brain's representations translate into pixels. Additionally, we present a novel space-time-resolved decoding technique, demonstrating how temporal resolution in decoding can advance our understanding of neural representations. Moreover, we introduce a learned receptive field layer that sheds light on the CNN-based model's data processing during training, enhancing understanding of its structure and interpretive capacity."
Poster,Monoculture in Matching Markets,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95331,"Kenny Peng, Nikhil Garg","Algorithmic monoculture arises when many decision-makers rely on the same algorithm to evaluate applicants. An emerging body of work investigates possible harms of this kind of homogeneity, but has been limited by the challenge of incorporating market effects in which the preferences and behavior of many applicants and decision-makers jointly interact to determine outcomes.Addressing this challenge, we introduce a tractable theoretical model of algorithmic monoculture in a two-sided matching market with many participants. We use the model to analyze outcomes under monoculture (when decision-makers all evaluate applicants using a common algorithm) and under polyculture (when decision-makers evaluate applicants independently). All else equal, monoculture (1) selects less-preferred applicants when noise is well-behaved, (2) matches more applicants to their top choice, though individual applicants may be worse off depending on their value to decision-makers and risk tolerance, and (3) is more robust to disparities in the number of applications submitted."
Poster,MonoMAE: Enhancing Monocular 3D Detection through Depth-Aware Masked Autoencoders,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93132,"Xueying Jiang, Sheng Jin, Xiaoqin Zhang, Ling Shao, Shijian Lu","Monocular 3D object detection aims for precise 3D localization and identification of objects from a single-view image. Despite its recent progress, it often struggles while handling pervasive object occlusions that tend to complicate and degrade the prediction of object dimensions, depths, and orientations. We design MonoMAE, a monocular 3D detector inspired by Masked Autoencoders that addresses the object occlusion issue by masking and reconstructing objects in the feature space. MonoMAE consists of two novel designs. The first is depth-aware masking that selectively masks certain parts of non-occluded object queries in the feature space for simulating occluded object queries for network training. It masks non-occluded object queries by balancing the masked and preserved query portions adaptively according to the depth information. The second is lightweight query completion that works with the depth-aware masking to learn to reconstruct and complete the masked object queries. With the proposed feature-space occlusion and completion, MonoMAE learns enriched 3D representations that achieve superior monocular 3D detection performance qualitatively and quantitatively for both occluded and non-occluded objects. Additionally, MonoMAE learns generalizable representations that can work well in new domains."
