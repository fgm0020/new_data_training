Poster,CRAYM: Neural Field Optimization via Camera RAY Matching,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93159,"Liqiang Lin, Wenpeng Wu, Chi-Wing Fu, Hao Zhang, Hui Huang","We introduce camera ray matching (CRAYM) into the joint optimization of camera poses and neural fields from multi-view images. The optimized field, referred to as a feature volume, can be “probed” by the camera rays for novel view synthesis (NVS) and 3D geometry reconstruction. One key reason for matching camera rays, instead of pixels as in prior works, is that the camera rays can be parameterized by the feature volume to carry both geometric and photometric information. Multi-view consistencies involving the camera rays and scene rendering can be naturally integrated into the joint optimization and network training, to impose physically meaningful constraints to improve the final quality of both the geometric reconstruction and photorealistic rendering. We formulate our per-ray optimization and matched ray coherence by focusing on camera rays passing through keypoints in the input images to elevate both the efficiency and accuracy of scene correspondences. Accumulated ray features along the feature volume provide a means to discount the coherence constraint amid erroneous ray matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRAYM for both NVS and geometry reconstruction, over dense- or sparse-view settings, with qualitative and quantitative comparisons to state-of-the-art alternatives."
Poster,Credal Deep Ensembles for Uncertainty Quantification,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95324,"Kaizheng Wang, Fabio Cuzzolin, Shireen Kudukkil Manchingal -, Keivan Shariatmadar, David Moens, Hans Hallez","This paper introduces an innovative approach to classification called Credal Deep Ensembles (CreDEs), namely, ensembles of novel Credal-Set Neural Networks (CreNets). CreNets are trained to predict a lower and an upper probability bound for each class, which, in turn, determine a convex set of probabilities (credal set) on the class set. The training employs a loss inspired by distributionally robust optimization which simulates the potential divergence of the test distribution from the training distribution, in such a way that the width of the predicted probability interval reflects the epistemic uncertainty about the future data distribution. Ensembles can be constructed by training multiple CreNets, each associated with a different random seed, and averaging the outputted intervals. Extensive experiments are conducted on various out-of-distributions (OOD) detection benchmarks (CIFAR10/100 vs SVHN/Tiny-ImageNet, CIFAR10 vs CIFAR10-C, ImageNet vs ImageNet-O) and using different network architectures (ResNet50, VGG16, and ViT Base). Compared to Deep Ensemble baselines, CreDEs demonstrate higher test accuracy, lower expected calibration error, and significantly improved epistemic uncertainty estimation."
Poster,Credal Learning Theory,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96268,"Michele Caprio, Maryam Sultana, Eleni Elia, Fabio Cuzzolin","Statistical learning theory is the foundation of machine learning, providing theoretical bounds for the risk of models learned from a (single) training set, assumed to issue from an unknown probability distribution. In actual deployment, however, the data distribution may (and often does) vary, causing domain adaptation/generalization issues. In this paper we lay the foundations for a `credal' theory of learning, using convex sets of probabilities (credal sets) to model the variability in the data-generating distribution. Such credal sets, we argue, may be inferred from a finite sample of training sets. Bounds are derived for the case of finite hypotheses spaces (both assuming realizability or not), as well as infinite model spaces, which directly generalize classical results."
Poster,Credit Attribution and Stable Compression,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94418,"Roi Livni, Shay Moran, Kobbi Nissim, Chirag Pabbaraju","Credit attribution is crucial across various fields. In academic research, proper citation acknowledges prior work and establishes original contributions. Similarly, in generative models, such as those trained on existing artworks or music, it is important to ensure that any generated content influenced by these works appropriately credits the original creators.We study credit attribution by machine learning algorithms. We propose new definitions--relaxations of Differential Privacy--that weaken the stability guarantees for a designated subset of $k$ datapoints. These $k$ datapoints can be used non-stably with permission from their owners, potentially in exchange for compensation. Meanwhile, the remaining datapoints are guaranteed to have no significant influence on the algorithm's output.Our framework extends well-studied notions of stability, including Differential Privacy ($k = 0$), differentially private learning with public data (where the $k$ public datapoints are fixed in advance),and stable sample compression (where the $k$ datapoints are selected adaptively by the algorithm).We examine the expressive power of these stability notions within the PAC learning framework, provide a comprehensive characterization of learnability for algorithms adhering to these principles, and propose directions and questions for future research."
Poster,Critically Assessing the State of the Art in Neural Network Verification,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/98315,"Matthias König, Annelot W. Bosman, Holger H. Hoos, Jan N. Van Rijn","Recent research has proposed various methods to formally verify neural networks against minimal input perturbations; this verification task is also known as local robustness verification. The research area of local robustness verification is highly diverse, as verifiers rely on a multitude of techniques, including mixed integer programming and satisfiability modulo theories. At the same time, the problem instances encountered when performing local robustness verification differ based on the network to be verified, the property to be verified and the specific network input. This raises the question of which verification algorithm is most suitable for solving specific types of instances of the local robustness verification problem. To answer this question, we performed a systematic performance analysis of several CPU- and GPU-based local robustness verification systems on a newly and carefully assembled set of 79 neural networks, of which we verified a broad range of robustness properties, while taking a practitioner's point of view -- a perspective that complements the insights from initiatives such as the VNN competition, where the participating tools are carefully adapted to the given benchmarks by their developers. Notably, we show that no single best algorithm dominates performance across all verification problem instances. Instead, our results reveal complementarities in verifier performance and illustrate the potential of leveraging algorithm portfolios for more efficient local robustness verification. We quantify this complementarity using various performance measures, such as the Shapley value. Furthermore, we confirm the notion that most algorithms only support ReLU-based networks, while other activation functions remain under-supported."
Poster,CriticEval: Evaluating Large-scale Language Model as Critic,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94609,"Tian Lan, Wenwei Zhang, Chen Xu, Heyan Huang, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen, Xian-Ling Mao","Critique ability, i.e., the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify and rectify flaws in responses, is crucial for their applications in self-improvement and scalable oversight. While numerous studies have been proposed to evaluate critique ability of LLMs, their comprehensiveness and reliability are still limited. To overcome this problem, we introduce CriticEval, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively and reliably evaluate critique ability of LLMs. Specifically, to ensure the comprehensiveness, CriticEval evaluates critique ability from four dimensions across nine diverse task scenarios. It evaluates both scalar-valued and textual critiques, targeting responses of varying quality. To ensure the reliability, a large number of critiques are annotated to serve as references, enabling GPT-4 to evaluate textual critiques reliably. Extensive evaluations of open-source and closed-source LLMs first validate the reliability of evaluation in CriticEval. Then, experimental results demonstrate the promising potential of open-source LLMs, the effectiveness of critique datasets and several intriguing relationships between the critique ability and some critical factors, including task types, response qualities and critique dimensions."
Poster,Croissant: A Metadata Format for ML-Ready Datasets,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97627,"Mubashara Akhtar, Omar Benjelloun, Costanza Conforti, Luca Foschini, Joan Giner-Miguelez, Pieter Gijsbers, Sujata Goswami, Nitisha Jain, Michalis Karamousadakis, Michael Kuchnik, Satyapriya Krishna, Sylvain Lesage, Quentin Lhoest, Pierre Marcenac, Manil Maskey, Peter Mattson, Luis Oala, Hamidah Oderinwale, Pierre Ruyssen, Tim Santos, Rajat Shinde, Elena Simperl, Arjun Suresh, Goeffry Thomas, Slava Tykhonov, Joaquin Vanschoren, Susheel Varma, Jos van der Velde, Steffen Vogler, Carole-Jean Wu, Luyao Zhang","Data is a critical resource for machine learning (ML), yet working with data remains a key friction point. This paper introduces Croissant,  a metadata format for datasets that creates a shared representation across ML tools, frameworks, and platforms. Croissant makes datasets more discoverable, portable, and interoperable, thereby addressing significant challenges in ML data management. Croissant is already supported by several popular dataset repositories, spanning hundreds of thousands of datasets, enabling easy loading into the most commonly-used ML frameworks, regardless of where the data is stored. Our initial evaluation by human raters shows that Croissant metadata is readable, understandable, complete, yet concise."
Poster,CRONOS: Enhancing Deep Learning with Scalable GPU Accelerated Convex Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94682,"Miria Feng, Zachary Frangella, Mert Pilanci","We introduce the CRONOS algorithm for convex optimization of two-layer neural networks. CRONOS is the first algorithm capable of scaling to high-dimensional datasets such as ImageNet, which are ubiquitous in modern deep learning. This significantly improves upon prior work, which has been restricted to downsampled versions of MNIST and CIFAR-10.Taking CRONOS as a primitive, we then develop a new algorithm called CRONOS-AM, which combines CRONOS with alternating minimization, to obtain an algorithm capable of training multi-layer networks with arbitrary architectures.Our theoretical analysis proves that CRONOS converges to the global minimum of the convex reformulation under mild assumptions. In addition, we validate the efficacy of CRONOS and CRONOS-AM through extensive large-scale numerical experiments with GPU acceleration in JAX.Our results show that CRONOS-AM can obtain comparable or better validation accuracy than predominant tuned deep learning optimizers on vision and language tasks with benchmark datasets such as ImageNet and IMDb.To the best of our knowledge, CRONOS is the first algorithm which utilizes the convex reformulation to enhance performance on large-scale learning tasks."
Poster,Cross-Care: Assessing the Healthcare Implications of Pre-training Data on Language Model Bias,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97819,"Shan Chen, Jack Gallifant, Mingye Gao, Pedro Moreira, Nikolaj Munch, Ajay Muthukkumar, Arvind Rajan, Jaya Kolluri, Amelia Fiske, Janna Hastings, Hugo Aerts, Brian Anthony, Leo Anthony Celi, William La Cava, Danielle Bitterman","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly essential in processing natural languages, yet their application is frequently compromised by biases and inaccuracies originating in their training data.In this study, we introduce \textbf{Cross-Care}, the first benchmark framework dedicated to assessing biases and real world knowledge in LLMs, specifically focusing on the representation of disease prevalence across diverse demographic groups.We systematically evaluate how demographic biases embedded in pre-training corpora like $ThePile$ influence the outputs of LLMs.We expose and quantify discrepancies by juxtaposing these biases against actual disease prevalences in various U.S. demographic groups.Our results highlight substantial misalignment between LLM representation of disease prevalence and real disease prevalence rates across demographic subgroups, indicating a pronounced risk of bias propagation and a lack of real-world grounding for medical applications of LLMs.Furthermore, we observe that various alignment methods minimally resolve inconsistencies in the models' representation of disease prevalence across different languages.For further exploration and analysis, we make all data and a data visualization tool available at: \url{www.crosscare.net}."
Poster,Cross-Device Collaborative Test-Time Adaptation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94660,"Guohao Chen, Shuaicheng Niu, Deyu Chen, Shuhai Zhang, Changsheng Li, Yuanqing Li, Mingkui Tan","In this paper, we propose test-time Collaborative Lifelong Adaptation (CoLA), which is a general paradigm that can be incorporated with existing advanced TTA methods to boost the adaptation performance and efficiency in a multi-device collaborative manner. Specifically, we maintain and store a set of device-shared _domain knowledge vectors_, which accumulates the knowledge learned from all devices during their lifelong adaptation process. Based on this, CoLA conducts two collaboration strategies for devices with different computational resources and latency demands. 1) Knowledge reprogramming learning strategy jointly learns new domain-specific model parameters and a reweighting term to reprogram existing shared domain knowledge vectors, termed adaptation on _principal agents_. 2) Similarity-based knowledge aggregation strategy solely aggregates the knowledge stored in shared domain vectors according to domain similarities in an optimization-free manner, termed adaptation on _follower agents_. Experiments verify that CoLA is simple but effective, which boosts the efficiency of TTA and demonstrates remarkable superiority in collaborative, lifelong, and single-domain TTA scenarios, e.g., on follower agents, we enhance accuracy by over 30\% on ImageNet-C while maintaining nearly the same efficiency as standard inference.
