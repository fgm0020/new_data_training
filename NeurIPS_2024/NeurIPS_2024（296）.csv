Poster,Open-Vocabulary Object Detection via Language Hierarchy,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95037,"Jiaxing Huang, Jingyi Zhang, Kai Jiang, Shijian Lu","Recent studies on generalizable object detection have attracted increasing attention with additional weak supervision from large-scale datasets with image-level labels.However, weakly-supervised detection learning often suffers from image-to-box label mismatch, i.e., image-levellabels do not convey precise object information.We design Language Hierarchical Self-training (LHST) that introduces language hierarchy into weakly-supervised detector training for learning more generalizable detectors.LHST expands the image-level labels with language hierarchy and enables co-regularization between the expanded labels and self-training. Specifically, the expanded labels regularize self-training by providing richer supervision and mitigating the image-to-box label mismatch, while self-training allows assessing and selecting the expanded labels according to the predicted reliability.In addition, we design language hierarchical prompt generation that introduces language hierarchy into prompt generation which helps bridge the vocabulary gaps between training and testing.Extensive experiments show that the proposed techniques achieve superior generalization performance consistently across 14 widely studied object detection datasets."
Poster,OPERA: Automatic Offline Policy Evaluation with Re-weighted Aggregates of Multiple Estimators,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95056,"Allen Nie, Yash Chandak, Christina Yuan, Anirudhan Badrinath, Yannis Flet-Berliac, Emma Brunskill","Offline policy evaluation (OPE) allows us to evaluate and estimate a new sequential decision-making policy's performance by leveraging historical interaction data collected from other policies. Evaluating a new policy online without a confident estimate of its performance can lead to costly, unsafe, or hazardous outcomes, especially in education and healthcare. Several OPE estimators have been proposed in the last decade, many of which have hyperparameters and require training. Unfortunately, choosing the best OPE algorithm for each task and domain is still unclear. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that adaptively blends a set of OPE estimators given a dataset without relying on an explicit selection using a statistical procedure. We prove that our estimator is consistent and satisfies several desirable properties for policy evaluation. Additionally, we demonstrate that when compared to alternative approaches, our estimator can be used to select higher-performing policies in healthcare and robotics. Our work contributes to improving ease of use for a general-purpose, estimator-agnostic, off-policy evaluation framework for offline RL."
Poster,Operator World Models for Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93875,"Pietro Novelli, Marco Pratticò, Massimiliano Pontil, Carlo Ciliberto","Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) is a powerful and theoretically sound methodology for sequential decision-making. However, it is not directly applicable to Reinforcement Learning (RL) due to the inaccessibility of explicit action-value functions. We address this challenge by introducing a novel approach based on learning a world model of the environment using conditional mean embeddings. Leveraging tools from operator theory we derive a closed-form expression of the action-value function in terms of the world model via simple matrix operations. Combining these estimators with PMD leads to POWR, a new RL algorithm for which we prove convergence rates to the global optimum. Preliminary experiments in finite and infinite state settings support the effectiveness of our method."
Poster,Opponent Modeling based on Subgoal Inference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95566,"XiaoPeng Yu, Jiechuan Jiang, Zongqing Lu","When an agent is in a multi-agent environment, it may face previously unseen opponents, and it is a challenge to cooperate with other agents to accomplish the task together or to maximize its own rewards. Most opponent modeling methods deal with the non-stationarity caused by unknown opponent policies via predicting the opponent’s actions. However, focusing on the opponent’s action is shortsighted, which also constrains the adaptability to unknown opponents in complex tasks. In this paper, we propose opponent modeling based on subgoal inference, which infers the opponent’s subgoals through historical trajectories. As subgoals are likely to be shared by different opponent policies, predicting subgoals can yield better generalization to unknown opponents. Additionally, we design two subgoal selection modes for cooperative games and general-sum games respectively. Empirically, we show that our method achieves more effective adaptation than existing methods in a variety of tasks."
Poster,Opponent Modeling with In-context Search,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94501,"Yuheng Jing, Bingyun Liu, Kai Li, Yifan Zang, Haobo Fu, Qiang Fu, Junliang Xing, Jian Cheng","Opponent modeling is a longstanding research topic aimed at enhancing decision-making by modeling information about opponents in multi-agent environments. However, existing approaches often face challenges such as having difficulty generalizing to unknown opponent policies and conducting unstable performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel approach based on in-context learning and decision-time search named Opponent Modeling with In-context Search (OMIS). OMIS leverages in-context learning-based pretraining to train a Transformer model for decision-making. It consists of three in-context components: an actor learning best responses to opponent policies, an opponent imitator mimicking opponent actions, and a critic estimating state values. When testing in an environment that features unknown non-stationary opponent agents, OMIS uses pretrained in-context components for decision-time search to refine the actor's policy. Theoretically, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, OMIS without search converges in opponent policy recognition and has good generalization properties; with search, OMIS provides improvement guarantees, exhibiting performance stability. Empirically, in competitive, cooperative, and mixed environments, OMIS demonstrates more effective and stable adaptation to opponents than other approaches.

Poster,OptEx: Expediting First-Order Optimization with Approximately Parallelized Iterations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95472,"Yao Shu, Jiongfeng Fang, Ying He, Fei Yu","First-order optimization (FOO) algorithms are pivotal in numerous computational domains, such as reinforcement learning and deep learning. However, their application to complex tasks often entails significant optimization inefficiency due to their need of many sequential iterations for convergence. In response, we introduce first-order optimization expedited with approximately parallelized iterations (OptEx), the first general framework that enhances the time efficiency of FOO by leveraging parallel computing to directly mitigate its requirement of many sequential iterations for convergence. To achieve this, OptEx utilizes a kernelized gradient estimation that is based on the history of evaluated gradients to predict the gradients required by the next few sequential iterations in FOO, which helps to break the inherent iterative dependency and hence enables the approximate parallelization of iterations in FOO. We further establish theoretical guarantees for the estimation error of our kernelized gradient estimation and the iteration complexity of SGD-based OptEx, confirming that the estimation error diminishes to zero as the history of gradients accumulates and that our SGD-based OptEx enjoys an effective acceleration rate of Θ(√N ) over standard SGD given parallelism of N, in terms of the sequential iterations required for convergence. Finally, we provide extensive empirical studies, including synthetic functions, reinforcement learning tasks, and neural network training on various datasets, to underscore the substantial efficiency improvements achieved by our OptEx in practice."
Poster,Optical Diffusion Models for Image Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95165,"Ilker Oguz, Niyazi Dinc, Mustafa Yildirim, Junjie Ke, Innfarn Yoo, Qifei Wang, Feng Yang, Christophe Moser, Demetri Psaltis","Diffusion models generate new samples by progressively decreasing the noise from the initially provided random distribution. This inference procedure generally utilizes a trained neural network numerous times to obtain the final output, creating significant latency and energy consumption on digital electronic hardware such as GPUs. In this study, we demonstrate that the propagation of a light beam through a transparent medium can be programmed to implement a denoising diffusion model on image samples. This framework projects noisy image patterns through passive diffractive optical layers, which collectively only transmit the predicted noise term in the image. The optical transparent layers, which are trained with an online training approach, backpropagating the error to the analytical model of the system, are passive and kept the same across different steps of denoising.  Hence this method enables high-speed image generation with minimal power consumption, benefiting from the bandwidth and energy efficiency of optical information processing."
Poster,Optimal ablation for interpretability,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93600,"Maximilian Li, Lucas Janson","Interpretability studies often involve tracing the flow of information through machine learning models to identify specific model components that perform relevant computations for tasks of interest. Prior work quantifies the importance of a model component on a particular task by measuring the impact of performing ablation on that component, or simulating model inference with the component disabled. We propose a new method, optimal ablation (OA), and show that OA-based component importance has theoretical and empirical advantages over measuring importance via other ablation methods. We also show that OA-based component importance can benefit several downstream interpretability tasks, including circuit discovery, localization of factual recall, and latent prediction."
Poster,Optimal Aggregation of Prediction Intervals under Unsupervised Domain Shift,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93815,"Jiawei Ge, Debarghya Mukherjee, Jianqing Fan","As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in dynamic environments, it becomes paramount to assess and quantify uncertainties associated with distribution shifts.A distribution shift occurs when the underlying data-generating process changes, leading to a deviation in the model's performance. The prediction interval, which captures the range of likely outcomes for a given prediction, serves as a crucial tool for characterizing uncertainties induced by their underlying distribution. In this paper, we propose methodologies for aggregating prediction intervals to obtain one with minimal width and adequate coverage on the target domain under unsupervised domain shift, under which we have labeled samples from a related source domain and unlabeled covariates from the target domain.Our analysis encompasses scenarios where the source and the target domain are related via i) a bounded density ratio, and ii) a measure-preserving transformation.Our proposed methodologies are computationally efficient and easy to implement. Beyond illustrating the performance of our method through real-world datasets, we also delve into the theoretical details. This includes establishing rigorous theoretical guarantees, coupled with finite sample bounds, regarding the coverage and width of our prediction intervals. Our approach excels in practical applications and is underpinned by a solid theoretical framework, ensuring its reliability and effectiveness across diverse contexts."
Poster,Optimal Algorithms for Augmented Testing of Discrete Distributions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93354,"Maryam Aliakbarpour, Piotr Indyk, Ronitt Rubinfeld, Sandeep Silwal","We consider the problem of hypothesis testing for discrete distributions. In the standard model, where we have sample access to an underlying distribution $p$, extensive research has established optimal bounds for uniformity testing,  identity testing (goodness of fit), and closeness testing (equivalence or two-sample testing). We explore these problems in a setting where a predicted data distribution, possibly derived from historical data or predictive machine learning models, is available. We demonstrate that such a predictor can indeed reduce the number of samples required for all three property testing tasks. The reduction in sample complexity depends directly on the predictor’s quality, measured by its total variation distance from $p$. A key advantage of our algorithms is their adaptability to the precision of the prediction. Specifically, our algorithms can self-adjust their sample complexity based on the accuracy of the available prediction, operating without any prior knowledge of the estimation’s accuracy (i.e. they are consistent). Additionally, we never use more samples than the standard approaches require, even if the predictions provide no meaningful information (i.e. they are also robust). We provide lower bounds to indicate that the improvements in sample complexity achieved by our algorithms are information-theoretically optimal. Furthermore, experimental results show that the performance of our algorithms on real data significantly exceeds our worst-case guarantees for sample complexity, demonstrating the practicality of our approach."
