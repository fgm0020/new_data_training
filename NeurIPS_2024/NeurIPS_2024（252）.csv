Poster,Metacognitive Capabilities of LLMs: An Exploration in Mathematical Problem Solving,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96107,"Aniket Didolkar, Anirudh Goyal, Nan Rosemary Ke, Siyuan Guo, Michal Valko, Timothy Lillicrap, Danilo Jimenez Rezende, Yoshua Bengio, Michael Mozer, Sanjeev Arora","\emph{Metacognitive knowledge} refers to humans' intuitive knowledge of their own thinking and reasoning processes. Today's best LLMs clearly possess some reasoning processes. The paper gives evidence that they also  have metacognitive knowledge, including ability to name skills and procedures to apply given a task. We explore this primarily in context of math reasoning, developing a prompt-guided interaction procedure  to get a powerful  LLM to assign sensible skill labels to math questions, followed by having it perform semantic clustering to obtain coarser families of skill labels. These coarse skill labels look interpretable to humans.To validate that these skill labels are meaningful and relevant to the LLM's reasoning processes we perform the following experiments. (a) We ask GPT-4 to assign skill labels to training questions in math datasets GSM8K and MATH.  (b) When using an LLM to solve the test questions, we present it with the full list of skill labels and ask it to identify the skill needed. Then it is presented with randomly selected exemplar solved questions associated with that skill label.  This improves accuracy on GSM8k and MATH for several strong LLMs, including code-assisted models. The methodology presented is domain-agnostic,  even though this article applies it to math problems."
Poster,Meta-Controller: Few-Shot Imitation of Unseen Embodiments and Tasks in Continuous Control,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95546,"Seongwoong Cho, Donggyun Kim, Jinwoo Lee, Seunghoon Hong","Generalizing across robot embodiments and tasks is crucial for adaptive robotic systems. Modular policy learning approaches adapt to new embodiments but are limited to specific tasks, while few-shot imitation learning (IL) approaches often focus on a single embodiment.In this paper, we introduce a few-shot behavior cloning framework to simultaneously generalize to unseen embodiments and tasks using a few (e.g., five) reward-free demonstrations. Our framework leverages a joint-level input-output representation to unify the state and action spaces of heterogeneous embodiments and employs a novel structure-motion state encoder that is parameterized to capture both shared knowledge across all embodiments and embodiment-specific knowledge. A matching-based policy network then predicts actions from a few demonstrations, producing an adaptive policy that is robust to over-fitting. Evaluated in the DeepMind Control suite, our framework termed Meta-Controller demonstrates superior few-shot generalization to unseen embodiments and tasks over modular policy learning and few-shot IL approaches."
Poster,MetaCURL: Non-stationary Concave Utility Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95035,"Bianca Marin Moreno, Margaux Brégère, Pierre Gaillard, Nadia Oudjane","We explore online learning in episodic loop-free Markov decision processes on non-stationary environments (changing losses and probability transitions). Our focus is on the Concave Utility Reinforcement Learning problem (CURL), an extension of classical RL for handling convex performance criteria in state-action distributions induced by agent policies. While various machine learning problems can be written as CURL, its non-linearity invalidates traditional Bellman equations. Despite recent solutions to classical CURL, none address non-stationary MDPs. This paper introduces MetaCURL, the first CURL algorithm for non-stationary MDPs. It employs a meta-algorithm running multiple black-box algorithms instances over different intervals, aggregating outputs via a sleeping expert framework. The key hurdle is partial information due to MDP uncertainty. Under partial information on the probability transitions (uncertainty and non-stationarity coming only from external noise, independent of agent state-action pairs), we achieve optimal dynamic regret without prior knowledge of MDP changes. Unlike approaches for RL, MetaCURL handles full adversarial losses, not just stochastic ones. We believe our approach for managing non-stationarity with experts can be of interest to the RL community."
Poster,Meta-Diffu$B$: A Contextualized Sequence-to-Sequence Text Diffusion Model with Meta-Exploration,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95436,"Yun-Yen Chuang, Hung-Min Hsu, Kevin Lin, Chen-Sheng Gu, Ling-Zhen Li, Ray-I Chang, Hung-yi Lee","The diffusion model, a new generative modeling paradigm, has achieved significant success in generating images, audio, video, and text. It has been adapted for sequence-to-sequence text generation (Seq2Seq) through DiffuSeq, termed the S2S-Diffusion model. Existing S2S-Diffusion models predominantly rely on fixed or hand-crafted rules to schedule noise during the diffusion and denoising processes. However, these models are limited by non-contextualized noise, which fails to fully consider the characteristics of Seq2Seq tasks. In this paper, we propose the Meta-Diffu$B$ framework—a novel scheduler-exploiter S2S-Diffusion paradigm designed to overcome the limitations of existing S2S-Diffusion models. We employ Meta-Exploration to train an additional scheduler model dedicated to scheduling contextualized noise for each sentence. Our exploiter model, an S2S-Diffusion model, leverages the noise scheduled by our scheduler model for updating and generation. Meta-Diffu$B$ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous S2S-Diffusion models and fine-tuned pre-trained language models (PLMs) across four Seq2Seq benchmark datasets. We further investigate and visualize the impact of Meta-Diffu$B$'s noise scheduling on the generation of sentences with varying difficulties. Additionally, our scheduler model can function as a ""plug-and-play"" model to enhance DiffuSeq without the need for fine-tuning during the inference stage."
Poster,Meta-DT: Offline Meta-RL as Conditional Sequence Modeling with World Model Disentanglement,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94988,"Zhi Wang, Li Zhang, Wenhao Wu, Yuanheng Zhu, Dongbin Zhao, Chunlin Chen","A longstanding goal of artificial general intelligence is highly capable generalists that can learn from diverse experiences and generalize to unseen tasks. The language and vision communities have seen remarkable progress toward this trend by scaling up transformer-based models trained on massive datasets, while reinforcement learning (RL) agents still suffer from poor generalization capacity under such paradigms. To tackle this challenge, we propose Meta Decision Transformer (Meta-DT), which leverages the sequential modeling ability of the transformer architecture and robust task representation learning via world model disentanglement to achieve efficient generalization in offline meta-RL. We pretrain a context-aware world model to learn a compact task representation, and inject it as a contextual condition to the causal transformer to guide task-oriented sequence generation. Then, we subtly utilize history trajectories generated by the meta-policy as a self-guided prompt to exploit the architectural inductive bias. We select the trajectory segment that yields the largest prediction error on the pretrained world model to construct the prompt, aiming to encode task-specific information complementary to the world model maximally. Notably, the proposed framework eliminates the requirement of any expert demonstration or domain knowledge at test time. Experimental results on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks across various dataset types show that Meta-DT exhibits superior few and zero-shot generalization capacity compared to strong baselines while being more practical with fewer prerequisites. Our code is available at https://github.com/NJU-RL/Meta-DT."
Poster,Meta-Exploiting Frequency Prior for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96793,"Fei Zhou, Peng Wang, Lei Zhang, Zhenghua Chen, Wei Wei, Chen Ding, Guosheng Lin, Yanning Zhang","Meta-learning offers a promising avenue for few-shot learning (FSL), enabling models to glean a generalizable feature embedding through episodic training on synthetic FSL tasks in a source domain. Yet, in practical scenarios where the target task diverges from that in the source domain, meta-learning based method is susceptible to over-fitting. To overcome this, we introduce a novel framework, Meta-Exploiting Frequency Prior for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning, which is crafted to comprehensively exploit the cross-domain transferable image prior that each image can be decomposed into complementary low-frequency content details and high-frequency robust structural characteristics. Motivated by this insight, we propose to decompose each query image into its high-frequency and low-frequency components, and parallel incorporate them into the feature embedding network to enhance the final category prediction. More importantly, we introduce a feature reconstruction prior and a prediction consistency prior to separately encourage the consistency of the intermediate feature as well as the final category prediction between the original query image and its decomposed frequency components. This allows for collectively guiding the network's meta-learning process with the aim of learning generalizable image feature embeddings, while not introducing any extra computational cost in the inference phase. Our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results on multiple cross-domain few-shot learning benchmarks."
Poster,MetaLA: Unified Optimal Linear Approximation to Softmax Attention Map,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94714,"YUHONG CHOU, Man Yao, Kexin Wang, Yuqi Pan, Rui-Jie Zhu, Jibin Wu, Yiran Zhong, Yu Qiao, Bo Xu, Guoqi Li","Various linear complexity models, such as Linear Transformer (LinFormer), State Space Model (SSM), and Linear RNN (LinRNN), have been proposed to replace the conventional softmax attention in Transformer structures. However, the optimal design of these linear models is still an open question. In this work, we attempt to answer this question by finding the best linear approximation to softmax attention from a theoretical perspective. We start by unifying existing linear complexity models as the linear attention form and then identify three conditions for the optimal linear attention design: (1) Dynamic memory ability; (2) Static approximation ability; (3) Least parameter approximation. We find that none of the current linear models meet all three conditions, resulting in suboptimal performance. Instead, we propose Meta Linear Attention (MetaLA) as a solution that satisfies these conditions. Our experiments on Multi-Query Associative Recall (MQAR) task, language modeling, image classification, and Long-Range Arena (LRA) benchmark demonstrate that MetaLA is more effective than the existing linear models."
Poster,Meta-Learning Universal Priors Using Non-Injective Change of Variables,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96052,"Yilang Zhang, Alireza Sadeghi, Georgios Giannakis","Meta-learning empowers data-hungry deep neural networks to rapidly learn from merely a few samples, which is especially appealing to tasks with small datasets. Critical in this context is the *prior knowledge* accumulated from related tasks. Existing meta-learning approaches typically rely on preselected priors, such as a Gaussian probability density function (pdf). The limited expressiveness of such priors however, hinders the enhanced performance of the trained model when dealing with tasks having exceedingly scarce data. Targeting improved expressiveness, this contribution introduces a *data-driven* prior that optimally fits the provided tasks using a novel non-injective change-of-variable (NCoV) model. Unlike preselected prior pdfs with fixed shapes, the advocated NCoV model can effectively approximate a considerably wide range of pdfs. Moreover, compared to conventional change-of-variable models, the introduced NCoV exhibits augmented expressiveness for pdf modeling, especially in high-dimensional spaces. Theoretical analysis underscores the appealing universal approximation capacity of the NCoV model. Numerical experiments conducted on three few-shot learning datasets validate the superiority of data-driven priors over the prespecified ones, showcasing its pronounced effectiveness when dealing with extremely limited data resources."
Poster,Meta-Reinforcement Learning with Universal Policy Adaptation: Provable Near-Optimality under All-task Optimum Comparator,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93412,"Siyuan Xu, Minghui Zhu","Meta-reinforcement learning (Meta-RL) has attracted attention due to its capability to enhance reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, in terms of data efficiency and generalizability. In this paper, we develop a bilevel optimization framework for meta-RL (BO-MRL) to learn the meta-prior for task-specific policy adaptation, which implements multiple-step policy optimization on one-time data collection. Beyond existing meta-RL analyses, we provide upper bounds of the expected optimality gap over the task distribution. This metric measures the distance of the policy adaptation from the learned meta-prior to the task-specific optimum, and quantifies the model's generalizability to the task distribution. We empirically validate the correctness of the derived upper bounds and demonstrate the superior effectiveness of the proposed algorithm over benchmarks."
Poster,MetaUAS: Universal Anomaly Segmentation with One-Prompt Meta-Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96642,Bin-Bin Gao,"Zero- and few-shot visual anomaly segmentation relies on powerful vision-language models that detect unseen anomalies using manually designed textual prompts. However, visual representations are inherently independent of language. In this paper, we explore the potential of a pure visual foundation model as an alternative to widely used vision-language models for universal visual anomaly segmentation.We present a novel paradigm that unifies anomaly segmentation into change segmentation. This paradigm enables us to leverage large-scale synthetic image pairs, featuring object-level and local region changes, derived from existing image datasets, which are independent of target anomaly datasets. We propose a one-prompt Meta-learning framework for Universal Anomaly Segmentation (MetaUAS) that is trained on this synthetic dataset and then generalizes well to segment any novel or unseen visual anomalies in the real world. To handle geometrical variations between prompt and query images, we propose a soft feature alignment module that bridges paired-image change perception and single-image semantic segmentation. This is the first work to achieve universal anomaly segmentation using a pure vision model without relying on special anomaly detection datasets and pre-trained visual-language models. Our method effectively and efficiently segments any anomalies with only one normal image prompt and enjoys training-free without guidance from language. Our MetaUAS significantly outperforms previous zero-shot, few-shot, and even full-shot anomaly segmentation methods. Code and Models: https://github.com/gaobb/MetaUAS."
