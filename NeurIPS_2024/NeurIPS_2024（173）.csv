Poster,GlotCC: An Open Broad-Coverage CommonCrawl Corpus and Pipeline for Minority Languages,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97624,"Amir Hossein Kargaran, François Yvon, Hinrich Schuetze","The need for large text corpora has increased with the advent of pretrained language models and, in particular, the discovery of scaling laws for these models. Most available corpora have sufficient data only for languages with large dominant communities. However, there is no corpus available that (i) covers a wide range of minority languages; (ii) is generated by an open-source reproducible pipeline; and (iii) is rigorously cleaned from noise, making it trustworthy to use. We present GlotCC, a clean, document-level, 2TB general domain corpus derived from CommonCrawl, covering more than 1000 languages. We make GlotCC and the system used to generate it— including the pipeline, language identification model, and filters—available to the research community.Corpus v. 1.0 https://huggingface.co/datasets/cis-lmu/GlotCC-v1Pipeline v. 3.0 https://github.com/cisnlp/GlotCC"
Poster,GMAI-MMBench: A Comprehensive Multimodal Evaluation Benchmark Towards General Medical AI,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97754,"pengcheng chen, Jin Ye, Guoan Wang, Yanjun Li, Zhongying Deng, Wei Li, Tianbin Li, Haodong Duan, Ziyan Huang, Yanzhou Su, Benyou Wang, Shaoting Zhang, Bin Fu, Jianfei Cai, Bohan Zhuang, Eric Seibel, Junjun He, Yu Qiao","Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are capable of handling diverse data types such as imaging, text, and physiological signals, and can be applied in various fields. In the medical field, LVLMs have a high potential to offer substantial assistance for diagnosis and treatment. Before that, it is crucial to develop benchmarks to evaluate LVLMs' effectiveness in various medical applications. Current benchmarks are often built upon specific academic literature, mainly focusing on a single domain, and lacking varying perceptual granularities. Thus, they face specific challenges, including limited clinical relevance, incomplete evaluations, and insufficient guidance for interactive LVLMs. To address these limitations, we developed the GMAI-MMBench, the most comprehensive general medical AI benchmark with well-categorized data structure and multi-perceptual granularity to date. It is constructed from 284 datasets across 38 medical image modalities, 18 clinical-related tasks, 18 departments, and 4 perceptual granularities in a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format. Additionally, we implemented a lexical tree structure that allows users to customize evaluation tasks, accommodating various assessment needs and substantially supporting medical AI research and applications. We evaluated 50 LVLMs, and the results show that even the advanced GPT-4o only achieves an accuracy of 53.96\%, indicating significant room for improvement. Moreover, we identified five key insufficiencies in current cutting-edge LVLMs that need to be addressed to advance the development of better medical applications. We believe that GMAI-MMBench will stimulate the community to build the next generation of LVLMs toward GMAI."
Poster,GO4Align: Group Optimization for Multi-Task Alignment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96340,"Jiayi Shen, Qi Wang, Zehao Xiao, Nanne van Noord, Marcel Worring","This paper proposes **GO4Align**, a multi-task optimization approach that tackles task imbalance by explicitly aligning the optimization across tasks. To achieve this, we design an adaptive group risk minimization strategy, comprising two techniques in implementation: (i) dynamical group assignment, which clusters similar tasks based on task interactions; (ii) risk-guided group indicators, which exploit consistent task correlations with risk information from previous iterations. Comprehensive experimental results on diverse benchmarks demonstrate our method's performance superiority with even lower computational costs."
Poster,Goal-Conditioned On-Policy Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95665,"Xudong Gong, Feng Dawei, Kele Xu, Bo Ding, Huaimin Wang","Existing Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) algorithms are built upon Hindsight Experience Replay (HER), which densifies rewards through hindsight replay and leverages historical goal-achieving information to construct a learning curriculum. However, when the task is characterized by a non-Markovian reward (NMR), whose computation depends on multiple steps of states and actions, HER can no longer densify rewards by treating a single encountered state as the hindsight goal. The lack of informative rewards hinders policy learning, resulting in rolling out failed trajectories. Consequently, the replay buffer is overwhelmed with failed trajectories, impeding the establishment of an applicable curriculum. To circumvent these limitations, we deviate from existing HER-based methods and propose an on-policy GCRL framework, GCPO, which is applicable to both multi-goal Markovian reward (MR) and NMR problems.GCPO consists of (1) Pre-training from Demonstrations, which pre-trains the policy to possess an initial goal-achieving capability, thereby diminishing the difficulty of subsequent online learning. (2) Online Self-Curriculum Learning, which first estimates the policy's goal-achieving capability based on historical evaluation information and then selects progressively challenging goals for learning based on its current capability. We evaluate GCPO on a challenging multi-goal long-horizon task: fixed-wing UAV velocity vector control. Experimental results demonstrate that GCPO is capable of effectively addressing both multi-goal MR and NMR problems."
Poster,Goal Conditioned Reinforcement Learning for Photo Finishing Tuning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96640,"Jiarui Wu, Yujin Wang, Lingen Li, Zhang Fan, Tianfan Xue","Photo finishing tuning aims to automate the manual tuning process of the photo finishing pipeline, like Adobe Lightroom or Darktable. Previous works either use zeroth-order optimization, which is slow when the set of parameters increases, or rely on a differentiable proxy of the target finishing pipeline, which is hard to train.To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel goal-conditioned reinforcement learning framework for efficiently tuning parameters using a goal image as a condition. Unlike previous approaches, our tuning framework does not rely on any proxy and treats the photo finishing pipeline as a black box. Utilizing a trained reinforcement learning policy, it can efficiently find the desired set of parameters within just 10 queries, while optimization based approaches normally take 200 queries. Furthermore, our architecture utilizes a goal image to guide the iterative tuning of pipeline parameters, allowing for flexible conditioning on pixel-aligned target images, style images, or any other visually representable goals. We conduct detailed experiments on photo finishing tuning and photo stylization tuning tasks, demonstrating the advantages of our method."
Poster,Goal Reduction with Loop-Removal Accelerates RL and Models Human Brain Activity in Goal-Directed Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94732,"Huzi Cheng, Joshua Brown","Goal-directed planning presents a challenge for classical RL algorithms due to the vastness of the combinatorial state and goal spaces, while humans and animals adapt to complex environments, especially with diverse, non-stationary objectives, often employing intermediate goals for long-horizon tasks.Here, we propose a goal reduction mechanism for effectively deriving subgoals from arbitrary and distant original goals, using a novel loop-removal technique.The product of the method, called goal-reducer, distills high-quality subgoals from a replay buffer, all without the need for prior global environmental knowledge.Simulations show that the goal-reducer can be integrated into RL frameworks like Deep Q-learning and Soft Actor-Critic.It accelerates performance in both discrete and continuous action space tasks, such as grid world navigation and robotic arm manipulation, relative to the corresponding standard RL models.Moreover, the goal-reducer, when combined with a local policy, without iterative training, outperforms its integrated deep RL counterparts in solving a navigation task.This goal reduction mechanism also models human problem-solving.Comparing the model's performance and activation with human behavior and fMRI data in a treasure hunting task, we found matching representational patterns between an goal-reducer agent's components and corresponding human brain areas, particularly the vmPFC and basal ganglia. The results suggest that humans may use a similar computational framework for goal-directed behaviors."
Poster,Going Beyond Heuristics by Imposing Policy Improvement as a Constraint,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93220,"Chi-Chang Lee, Zhang-Wei Hong, Pulkit Agrawal","In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, incorporating heuristic rewards alongside the task reward is crucial for achieving desirable performance. Heuristics encode prior human knowledge about how a task should be done, providing valuable hints for RL algorithms. However, such hints may not be optimal, limiting the performance of learned policies. The currently established way of using heuristics is to modify the heuristic reward in a manner that ensures that the optimal policy learned with it remains the same as the optimal policy for the task reward (i.e., optimal policy invariance). However, these methods often fail in practical scenarios with limited training data. We found that while optimal policy invariance ensures convergence to the best policy based on task rewards, it doesn't guarantee better performance than policies trained with biased heuristics under a finite data regime, which is impractical. In this paper, we introduce a new principle tailored for finite data settings. Instead of enforcing optimal policy invariance, we train a policy that combines task and heuristic rewards and ensures it outperforms the heuristic-trained policy. As such, we prevent policies from merely exploiting heuristic rewards without improving the task reward. Our experiments on robotic locomotion, helicopter control, and manipulation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the heuristic policy, regardless of the heuristic rewards' quality.Code is available at https://github.com/Improbable-AI/hepo."
Poster,GOMAA-Geo: GOal Modality Agnostic Active Geo-localization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94144,"Anindya Sarkar, Srikumar Sastry, Aleksis Pirinen, Chongjie Zhang, Nathan Jacobs, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik","We consider the task of active geo-localization (AGL) in which an agent uses a sequence of visual cues observed during aerial navigation to find a target specified through multiple possible modalities. This could emulate a UAV involved in a search-and-rescue operation navigating through an area, observing a stream of aerial images as it goes. The AGL task is associated with two important challenges.  Firstly, an agent must deal with a goal specification in one of multiple modalities (e.g., through a natural language description) while the search cues are provided in other modalities (aerial imagery). The second challenge is limited localization time (e.g., limited battery life, urgency) so that the goal must be localized as efficiently as possible, i.e. the agent must effectively leverage its sequentially observed aerial views when searching for the goal. To address these challenges, we propose GOMAA-Geo -- a goal modality agnostic active geo-localization agent -- for zero-shot generalization between different goal modalities. Our approach combines cross-modality contrastive learning to align representations across modalities with supervised foundation model pretraining and reinforcement learning to obtain highly effective navigation and localization policies. Through extensive evaluations, we show that GOMAA-Geo outperforms alternative learnable approaches and that it generalizes across datasets -- e.g., to disaster-hit areas without seeing a single disaster scenario during training -- and goal modalities -- e.g., to ground-level imagery or textual descriptions, despite only being trained with goals specified as aerial views. Our code is available at: https://github.com/mvrl/GOMAA-Geo."
Poster,GoMatching: A Simple Baseline for Video Text Spotting via Long and Short Term Matching,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96256,"Haibin He, Maoyuan Ye, Jing Zhang, Juhua Liu, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao","Beyond the text detection and recognition tasks in image text spotting, video text spotting presents an augmented challenge with the inclusion of tracking. While advanced end-to-end trainable methods have shown commendable performance, the pursuit of multi-task optimization may pose the risk of producing sub-optimal outcomes for individual tasks. In this paper, we identify a main bottleneck in the state-of-the-art video text spotter: the limited recognition capability. In response to this issue, we propose to efficiently turn an off-the-shelf query-based image text spotter into a specialist on video and present a simple baseline termed GoMatching, which focuses the training efforts on tracking while maintaining strong recognition performance. To adapt the image text spotter to video datasets, we add a rescoring head to rescore each detected instance's confidence via efficient tuning, leading to a better tracking candidate pool. Additionally, we design a long-short term matching module, termed LST-Matcher, to enhance the spotter's tracking capability by integrating both long- and short-term matching results via Transformer. Based on the above simple designs, GoMatching delivers new records on ICDAR15-video, DSText, BOVText, and our proposed novel test set with arbitrary-shaped text termed ArTVideo, which demonstates GoMatching's capability to accommodate general, dense, small, arbitrary-shaped, Chinese and English text scenarios while saving considerable training budgets. The code will be released."
Poster,Gorilla: Large Language Model Connected with Massive APIs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93353,"Shishir G Patil, Tianjun Zhang, Xin Wang, Joseph Gonzalez","Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen an impressive wave of advances, withmodels now excelling in a variety of tasks, such as mathematical reasoning andprogram synthesis. However, their potential to effectively use tools via API callsremains unfulfilled. This is a challenging task even for today’s state-of-the-artLLMs such as GPT-4 largely due to their unawareness of what APIs are availableand how to use them in a frequently updated tool set. We develop Gorilla, afinetuned LLaMA model that surpasses the performance of GPT-4 on writing APIcalls. Trained with the novel Retriever Aware Training (RAT), when combinedwith a document retriever, Gorilla demonstrates a strong capability to adapt totest-time document changes, allowing flexible user updates or version changes.It also substantially mitigates the issue of hallucination, commonly encounteredwhen prompting LLMs directly. To evaluate the model’s ability, we introduceAPIBench, a comprehensive dataset consisting of HuggingFace, TorchHub, andTensorHub APIs. The successful integration of the retrieval system with Gorillademonstrates the potential for LLMs to use tools more accurately, keep up withfrequently updated documentation, and consequently increase the reliability andapplicability of their outputs. Gorilla’s code, model, data, and demo are availableat: https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu"
