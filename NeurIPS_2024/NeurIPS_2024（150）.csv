Poster,Federated Learning from Vision-Language Foundation Models: Theoretical Analysis and Method,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94723,"Bikang Pan, Wei Huang, Ye Shi","Integrating pretrained vision-language foundation models like CLIP into federated learning has attracted significant attention for enhancing generalization across diverse tasks. Typically, federated learning of vision-language models employs prompt learning to reduce communication and computational costs, i.e., prompt-based federated learning. However, there is limited theoretical analysis to understand the performance of prompt-based federated learning. In this work, we construct a theoretical analysis framework for prompt-based federated learning via feature learning theory. Specifically, we monitor the evolution of signal learning and noise memorization in prompt-based federated learning, demonstrating that performance can be assessed by the ratio of task-relevant to task-irrelevant coefficients. Furthermore, we draw an analogy between income and risk in portfolio optimization and the task-relevant and task-irrelevant terms in feature learning. Leveraging inspiration from portfolio optimization that combining two independent assets will maintain the income while reducing the risk, we introduce two prompts: global prompt and local prompt to construct a prompt portfolio to balance the generalization and personalization. Consequently, we showed the performance advantage of the prompt portfolio and derived the optimal mixing coefficient. These theoretical claims have been further supported by empirical experiments."
Poster,Federated Learning over Connected Modes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95719,"Dennis Grinwald, Philipp Wiesner, Shinichi Nakajima","Statistical heterogeneity in federated learning poses two major challenges: slow global training due to conflicting gradient signals, and the need of personalization for local distributions. In this work, we tackle both challenges by leveraging recent advances in \emph{linear mode connectivity} --- identifying a linearly connected low-loss region in the parameter space of neural networks, which we call solution simplex. We propose federated learning over connected modes (\textsc{Floco}), where clients are assigned local subregions in this simplex based on their gradient signals, and together learn the shared global solution simplex. This allows personalization of the client models to fit their local distributions within the degrees of freedom in the solution simplex and homogenizes the update signals for the global simplex training.  Our experiments show that \textsc{Floco} accelerates the global training process, and significantly improves the local accuracy with minimal computational overhead in cross-silo federated learning settings."
Poster,Federated Learning under Periodic Client Participation and Heterogeneous Data: A New Communication-Efficient Algorithm and Analysis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94818,"Michael Crawshaw, Mingrui Liu","In federated learning, it is common to assume that clients are always available to participate in training, which may not be feasible with user devices in practice. Recent works analyze federated learning under more realistic participation patterns, such as cyclic client availability or arbitrary participation. However, all such works either require strong assumptions (e.g., all clients participate almost surely within a bounded window), do not achieve linear speedup and reduced communication rounds, or are not applicable in the general non-convex setting. In this work, we focus on nonconvex optimization and consider participation patterns in which the chance of participation over a fixed window of rounds is equal among all clients, which includes cyclic client availability as a special case. Under this setting, we propose a new algorithm, named Amplified SCAFFOLD, and prove that it achieves linear speedup, reduced communication, and resilience to data heterogeneity simultaneously. In particular, for cyclic participation, our algorithm is proved to enjoy $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ communication rounds to find an $\epsilon$-stationary point in the non-convex stochastic setting. In contrast, the prior work under the same setting requires $\mathcal{O}(\kappa^2 \epsilon^{-4})$ communication rounds, where $\kappa$ denotes the data heterogeneity. Therefore, our algorithm significantly reduces communication rounds due to better dependency in terms of $\epsilon$ and $\kappa$. Our analysis relies on a fine-grained treatment of the nested dependence between client participation and errors in the control variates, which results in tighter guarantees than previous work. We also provide experimental results with (1) synthetic data and (2) real-world data with a large number of clients $(N = 250)$, demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithm under periodic client participation."
Poster,Federated Model Heterogeneous Matryoshka Representation Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96556,"Liping Yi, Han Yu, Chao Ren, Gang Wang, xiaoguang Liu, Xiaoxiao Li","Model heterogeneous federated learning (MHeteroFL) enables FL clients to collaboratively train models with heterogeneous structures in a distributed fashion. However, existing MHeteroFL methods rely on training loss to transfer knowledge between the client model and the server model, resulting in limited knowledge exchange. To address this limitation, we propose the **Fed**erated model heterogeneous **M**atryoshka **R**epresentation **L**earning (**FedMRL**) approach for supervised learning tasks. It adds an auxiliary small homogeneous model shared by clients with heterogeneous local models. (1) The generalized and personalized representations extracted by the two models' feature extractors are fused by a personalized lightweight representation projector. This step enables representation fusion to adapt to local data distribution. (2) The fused representation is then used to construct Matryoshka representations with multi-dimensional and multi-granular embedded representations learned by the global homogeneous model header and the local heterogeneous model header. This step facilitates multi-perspective representation learning and improves model learning capability. Theoretical analysis shows that FedMRL achieves a $O(1/T)$ non-convex convergence rate. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate its superior model accuracy with low communication and computational costs compared to seven state-of-the-art baselines. It achieves up to 8.48% and 24.94% accuracy improvement compared with the state-of-the-art and the best same-category baseline, respectively."
Poster,Federated Natural Policy Gradient and Actor Critic Methods for Multi-task Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96087,"Tong Yang, Shicong Cen, Yuting Wei, Yuxin Chen, Yuejie Chi","Federated reinforcement learning (RL) enables collaborative decision making of multiple distributed agents without sharing local data trajectories. In this work, we consider a multi-task setting, in which each agent has its own private reward function corresponding to different tasks, while sharing the same transition kernel of the environment. Focusing on infinite-horizon Markov decision processes, the goal is to learn a globally optimal policy that maximizes the sum of the discounted total rewards of all the agents in a decentralized manner, where each agent only communicates with its neighbors over some prescribed graph topology.We develop federated vanilla and entropy-regularized natural policy gradient (NPG) methods in the tabular setting under softmax parameterization, where gradient tracking is applied to estimate the global Q-function to mitigate the impact of imperfect information sharing. We establish non-asymptotic global convergence guarantees under exact policy evaluation, where the rates are nearly independent of the size of the state-action space and illuminate the impacts of network size and connectivity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that global convergence is established for federated multi-task RL using policy optimization. We further go beyond the tabular setting by proposing a federated natural actor critic (NAC) method for multi-task RL with function approximation, and establish its finite-time sample complexity taking the errors of function approximation into account."
Poster,Federated Online Prediction from Experts with Differential Privacy: Separations and Regret Speed-ups,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95054,"Fengyu Gao, Ruiquan Huang, Jing Yang","We study the problems of differentially private federated online prediction from experts against both *stochastic adversaries* and *oblivious adversaries*. We aim to minimize the average regret on $m$ clients working in parallel over time horizon $T$ with explicit differential privacy (DP) guarantees. With stochastic adversaries, we propose a **Fed-DP-OPE-Stoch** algorithm that achieves $\sqrt{m}$-fold speed-up of the per-client regret compared to the single-player counterparts under both pure DP and approximate DP constraints, while maintaining logarithmic communication costs. With oblivious adversaries, we establish non-trivial lower bounds indicating that *collaboration among clients does not lead to regret speed-up with general oblivious adversaries*. We then consider a special case of the oblivious adversaries setting, where there exists a low-loss expert. We design a new algorithm **Fed-SVT** and show that it achieves an $m$-fold regret speed-up under both pure DP and approximate DP constraints over the single-player counterparts. Our lower bound indicates that Fed-SVT is nearly optimal up to logarithmic factors. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work examining the differentially private online prediction from experts in the federated setting."
Poster,Federated Transformer: Multi-Party Vertical Federated Learning on Practical Fuzzily Linked Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95945,"Zhaomin Wu, Junyi Hou, Yiqun Diao, Bingsheng He","Federated Learning (FL) is an evolving paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. Among its variants, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is particularly relevant in real-world, cross-organizational collaborations, where distinct features of a shared instance group are contributed by different parties. In these scenarios, parties are often linked using fuzzy identifiers, leading to a common practice termed as _multi-party fuzzy VFL_. Existing models generally address either multi-party VFL or fuzzy VFL between two parties. Extending these models to practical multi-party fuzzy VFL typically results in significant performance degradation and increased costs for maintaining privacy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the _Federated Transformer (FeT)_, a novel framework that supports multi-party VFL with fuzzy identifiers. FeT innovatively encodes these identifiers into data representations and employs a transformer architecture distributed across different parties, incorporating three new techniques to enhance performance. Furthermore, we have developed a multi-party privacy framework for VFL that integrates differential privacy with secure multi-party computation, effectively protecting local representations while minimizing associated utility costs. Our experiments demonstrate that the FeT surpasses the baseline models by up to 46\% in terms of accuracy when scaled to 50 parties. Additionally, in two-party fuzzy VFL settings, FeT also shows improved performance and privacy over cutting-edge VFL models."
Poster,FedGMark: Certifiably Robust Watermarking for Federated Graph Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93069,"Yuxin Yang, Qiang Li, Yuan Hong, Binghui Wang","Federated graph learning (FedGL) is an emerging learning paradigm to collaboratively train graph data from various clients. However, during the development and deployment of FedGL models, they are susceptible to illegal copying and model theft. Backdoor-based watermarking is a well-known method for mitigating these attacks, as it offers ownership verification to the model owner. We take the first step to protect the ownership of FedGL models via backdoor-based watermarking. Existing techniques have challenges in achieving the goal: 1) they either cannot be directly applied or yield unsatisfactory performance; 2) they are vulnerable to watermark removal attacks; and 3) they lack of formal guarantees. To address all the challenges, we propose FedGMark, the first certified robust backdoor-based watermarking for FedGL. FedGMark leverages the unique graph structure and client information in FedGL to learn customized and diverse watermarks. It also designs a novel GL architecture that facilitates defending against both the empirical and theoretically worst-case watermark removal attacks. Extensive experiments validate the promising empirical and provable watermarking performance of FedGMark. Source code is available at: https://github.com/Yuxin104/FedGMark."
Poster,FedGMKD: An Efficient Prototype Federated Learning Framework through Knowledge Distillation and Discrepancy-Aware Aggregation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94448,"Jianqiao Zhang, Caifeng Shan, Jungong Han","Federated Learning (FL) faces significant challenges due to data heterogeneity across distributed clients. To address this, we propose FedGMKD, a novel framework that combines knowledge distillation and differential aggregation for efficient prototype-based personalized FL without the need for public datasets or server-side generative models. FedGMKD introduces Cluster Knowledge Fusion, utilizing Gaussian Mixture Models to generate prototype features and soft predictions on the client side, enabling effective knowledge distillation while preserving data privacy. Additionally, we implement a Discrepancy-Aware Aggregation Technique that weights client contributions based on data quality and quantity, enhancing the global model's generalization across diverse client distributions. Theoretical analysis confirms the convergence of FedGMKD. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including SVHN, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, demonstrate that FedGMKD outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving both local and global accuracy in non-IID data settings."
Poster,FedGTST: Boosting Global Transferability of Federated Models via Statistics Tuning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95229,"Evelyn Ma, Chao Pan, S. Rasoul Etesami, Han Zhao, Olgica Milenkovic","The performance of Transfer Learning (TL) significantly depends on effective pretraining, which not only requires extensive amounts of data but also substantial computational resources. As a result, in practice, it is challenging to successfully perform TL at the level of individual model developers. Federated Learning (FL) addresses these challenges by enabling collaboration among individual clients through an indirect expansion of the available dataset, distribution of the computation burden across different entities, and privacy-preserving communication mechanisms. Despite several attempts to devise effective transferable FL approaches, several important issues remain unsolved. First, existing methods in this setting primarily focus on optimizing transferability within their local client domains, thereby ignoring transferability over the global learning domain. Second, most approaches focus on analyzing indirect transferability metrics, which does not allow for accurate assessment of the final target loss and extent of transferability. To address these issues, we introduce two important FL features into the model. The first boosts transferability via an exchange protocol between the clients and the server that includes information about cross-client Jacobian (gradient) norms. The second feature promotes an increase of the average of the Jacobians of the clients at the server side, which is subsequently used as a local regularizer that reduces the cross-client Jacobian variance. A rigorous analysis of our transferable federated algorithm, termed FedGTST (Federated Global Transferability via Statistics Tuning), reveals that increasing the averaged Jacobian norm across clients and reducing its variance ensures tight control of the target loss. This insight leads to the first known upper bound on the target loss of transferable federated learning in terms of the source loss and source-target domain discrepancy. Extensive experimental results on datasets including MNIST → MNIST-M and CIFAR10 → SVHN suggest that FedGTST significantly outperforms other relevant baselines, such as FedSR. For example, on the second source-target dataset pair, we improve the accuracy of FedSR by 9.8% and that of FedIIR by 7.6% when the backbone used is LeNet."
