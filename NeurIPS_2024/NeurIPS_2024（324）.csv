Poster,PuLID: Pure and Lightning ID Customization via Contrastive Alignment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96055,"Zinan Guo, Yanze Wu, Chen Zhuowei, Lang chen, Peng Zhang, Qian HE","We propose Pure and Lightning ID customization (PuLID), a novel tuning-free ID customization method for text-to-image generation. By incorporating a Lightning T2I branch with a standard diffusion one, PuLID introduces both contrastive alignment loss and accurate ID loss, minimizing disruption to the original model and ensuring high ID fidelity. Experiments show that PuLID achieves superior performance in both ID fidelity and editability. Another attractive property of PuLID is that the image elements (\eg, background, lighting, composition, and style) before and after the ID insertion are kept as consistent as possible. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/ToTheBeginning/PuLID"
Poster,PureGen: Universal Data Purification for Train-Time Poison Defense via Generative Model Dynamics,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94623,"Omead Pooladzandi, Sunay Bhat, Jeffrey Jiang, Alexander Branch, Gregory Pottie","Train-time data poisoning attacks threaten machine learning models by introducing adversarial examples during training, leading to misclassification. Current defense methods often reduce generalization performance, are attack-specific, and impose significant training overhead. To address this, we introduce a set of universal data purification methods using a stochastic transform, $\Psi(x)$, realized via iterative Langevin dynamics of Energy-Based Models (EBMs), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), or both. These approaches purify poisoned data with minimal impact on classifier generalization. Our specially trained EBMs and DDPMs provide state-of-the-art defense against various attacks (including Narcissus, Bullseye Polytope, Gradient Matching) on CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet, and CINIC-10, without needing attack or classifier-specific information. We discuss performance trade-offs and show that our methods remain highly effective even with poisoned or distributionally shifted generative model training data."
Poster,Pure Message Passing Can Estimate Common Neighbor for Link Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94755,"Kaiwen Dong, Zhichun Guo, Nitesh Chawla","Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) have emerged as the {\em de facto} standard in graph representation learning. However, when it comes to link prediction, they are not always superior to simple heuristics such as Common Neighbor (CN). This discrepancy stems from a fundamental limitation: while MPNNs excel in node-level representation, they stumble with encoding the joint structural features essential to link prediction, like CN. To bridge this gap, we posit that, by harnessing the orthogonality of input vectors, pure message-passing can indeed capture joint structural features. Specifically, we study the proficiency of MPNNs in approximating CN heuristics. Based on our findings, we introduce the Message Passing Link Predictor (MPLP), a novel link prediction model. MPLP taps into quasi-orthogonal vectors to estimate link-level structural features, all while preserving the node-level complexities. We conduct experiments on benchmark datasets from various domains, where our method consistently outperforms the baseline methods, establishing new state-of-the-arts."
Poster,PURE: Prompt Evolution with Graph ODE for Out-of-distribution Fluid Dynamics Modeling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92971,"Hao Wu, Changhu Wang, Fan Xu, Jinbao Xue, Chong Chen, Xian-Sheng Hua, Xiao Luo","This work studies the problem of out-of-distribution fluid dynamics modeling. Previous works usually design effective neural operators to learn from mesh-based data structures. However, in real-world applications, they would suffer from distribution shifts from the variance of system parameters and temporal evolution of the dynamical system. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named \underline{P}rompt Evol\underline{u}tion with G\underline{r}aph OD\underline{E} (\method{}) for out-of-distribution fluid dynamics modeling. The core of our \method{} is to learn time-evolving prompts using a graph ODE to adapt spatio-temporal forecasting models to different scenarios. In particular, our \method{} first learns from historical observations and system parameters in the frequency domain to explore multi-view context information, which could effectively initialize prompt embeddings. More importantly, we incorporate the interpolation of observation sequences into a graph ODE, which can capture the temporal evolution of prompt embeddings for model adaptation. These time-evolving prompt embeddings are then incorporated into basic forecasting models to overcome temporal distribution shifts. We also minimize the mutual information between prompt embeddings and observation embeddings to enhance the robustness of our model to different distributions. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets validate the superiority of the proposed \method{} in comparison to various baselines."
Poster,PutnamBench: Evaluating Neural Theorem-Provers on the Putnam Mathematical Competition,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97811,"George Tsoukalas, Jasper Lee, John Jennings, Jimmy Xin, Michelle Ding, Michael Jennings, Amitayush Thakur, Swarat Chaudhuri","We present PutnamBench, a new multi-language benchmark for evaluating the ability of neural theorem-provers to solve competition mathematics problems. PutnamBench consists of 1692 hand-constructed formalizations of 640 theorems sourced from the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, the premier undergraduate-level mathematics competition in North America. All the problems have formalizations in Lean 4 and Isabelle; a substantial subset also has Coq formalizations. PutnamBench requires significant problem-solving ability and proficiency in a broad range of topics taught in undergraduate mathematics courses. We use PutnamBench to evaluate several established neural and symbolic theorem-provers. These approaches can only solve a handful of the PutnamBench problems, establishing the benchmark as a difficult open challenge for research on neural theorem-proving. PutnamBench is available at https://github.com/trishullab/PutnamBench."
Poster,Putting Gale & Shapley to Work: Guaranteeing Stability Through Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95765,"Hadi Hosseini, Sanjukta Roy, Duohan Zhang","Two-sided matching markets describe a large class of problems wherein participants from one side of the market must be matched to those from the other side according to their preferences. In many real-world applications (e.g. content matching or online labor markets), the knowledge about preferences may not be readily available and must be learned, i.e., one side of the market (aka agents) may not know their preferences over the other side (aka arms). Recent research on online settings has focused primarily on welfare optimization aspects (i.e. minimizing the overall regret) while paying little attention to the game-theoretic properties such as the stability of the final matching. In this paper, we exploit the structure of stable solutions to devise algorithms that improve the likelihood of finding stable solutions. We initiate the study of the sample complexity of finding a stable matching, and provide theoretical bounds on the number of samples needed to reach a stable matching with high probability. Finally, our empirical results demonstrate intriguing tradeoffs between stability and optimality of the proposed algorithms, further complementing our theoretical findings."
Poster,PUZZLES: A Benchmark for Neural Algorithmic Reasoning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97818,"Benjamin Estermann, Luca Lanzendörfer, Yannick Niedermayr, Roger Wattenhofer","Algorithmic reasoning is a fundamental cognitive ability that plays a pivotal role in problem-solving and decision-making processes. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated remarkable proficiency in tasks such as motor control, handling perceptual input, and managing stochastic environments. These advancements have been enabled in part by the availability of benchmarks. In this work we introduce PUZZLES, a benchmark based on Simon Tatham's Portable Puzzle Collection, aimed at fostering progress in algorithmic and logical reasoning in RL. PUZZLES contains 40 diverse logic puzzles of adjustable sizes and varying levels of complexity, providing detailed information on the strengths and generalization capabilities of RL agents. Furthermore, we evaluate various RL algorithms on PUZZLES, providing baseline comparisons and demonstrating the potential for future research. All the software, including the environment, is available at this https url."
Poster,PV-Tuning: Beyond Straight-Through Estimation for Extreme LLM Compression,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94666,"Vladimir Malinovskii, Denis Mazur, Ivan Ilin, Denis Kuznedelev, Konstantin Burlachenko, Kai Yi, Dan Alistarh, Peter Richtarik","There has been significant interest in ""extreme"" compression of large language models (LLMs), i.e. to 1-2 bits per parameter, which allows such models to be executed efficiently on resource-constrained devices.  Existing work focused on improved one-shot quantization techniques and weight representations; yet, purely post-training  approaches are reaching diminishing returns in terms of the accuracy-vs-bit-width trade-off. State-of-the-art quantization methods such as QuIP# and AQLM include fine-tuning (part of) the compressed parameters over a limited amount of calibration data; however, such fine-tuning techniques over compressed weights often make exclusive use of straight-through estimators (STE), whose performance is not well-understood in this setting. In this work, we question the use of STE for extreme LLM compression, showing that it can be sub-optimal, and perform a systematic study of quantization-aware fine-tuning strategies for LLMs.We propose PV-Tuning - a representation-agnostic framework that generalizes and improves upon existing fine-tuning strategies, and provides convergence guarantees in restricted cases.On the practical side, when used for 1-2 bit vector quantization, PV-Tuning outperforms prior techniques for highly-performant models such as Llama and Mistral. Using PV-Tuning, we achieve the first Pareto-optimal quantization for Llama-2 family models at  2 bits per parameter."
Poster,QBB: Quantization with Binary Bases for LLMs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95634,"Adrian Bulat, Yassine Ouali, Georgios Tzimiropoulos","Current post-training quantization methods for LLMs compress the weights down to 4-bits, with moderate to low degradation in accuracy. However, further reducing the number of bits or accelerating the network while avoiding large accuracy drops, especially for smaller, sub 7B models, remains an actively researched and open problem. To address this, in this work, we introduce Quantization with Binary Bases (QBB), a new approach for low-bit quantization that effectively removes (nearly) all multiplications, reducing the implementation to summations. Our novel approach works by decomposing the original weights into a set of binary (1-bit) matrices using an iterative process. For a given layer, starting from a weight matrix, we first construct an initial approximation using an analytical solution, where each new binary matrix, paired with a scaling vector, approximates the residual error of the previous estimation. Secondly, using gradient descent and a progressive learning curriculum, we find the optimal set of binary matrices and scaling vectors that minimize the $\ell_2$ distance between the produced approximation and original weights. Thirdly, as previous steps are input agnostic, we holistically optimize the scaling vectors alone, calibrating them in student-teacher fashion, with the teacher providing both the data,  by autoregressive generation starting from a random token, and the target logits. When evaluated across multiple LLM families, our approach matches and outperforms all prior works, setting a new state-of-the-art result using a summation-only based approach."
Poster,Q-Distribution guided Q-learning for offline reinforcement learning: Uncertainty penalized Q-value via consistency model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95452,"Jing Zhang, Linjiajie Fang, Kexin SHI, Wenjia Wang, Bingyi Jing","``Distribution shift'' is the primary obstacle to the success of offline reinforcement learning. As a learning policy may take actions beyond the knowledge of the behavior policy (referred to as Out-of-Distribution (OOD) actions), the Q-values of these OOD actions can be easily overestimated. Consequently, the learning policy becomes biasedly optimized using the incorrect recovered Q-value function. One commonly used idea to avoid the overestimation of Q-value is to make a pessimistic adjustment. Our key idea is to penalize the Q-values of OOD actions that correspond to high uncertainty. In this work, we propose Q-Distribution guided Q-learning (QDQ) which  pessimistic Q-value on OOD regions based on uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty measure is based on the conditional Q-value distribution, which is learned via a high-fidelity and efficient consistency model. On the other hand, to avoid the overly conservative problem, we introduce an uncertainty-aware optimization objective to update the Q-value function. The proposed QDQ demonstrates solid theoretical guarantees for the accuracy of Q-value distribution learning and uncertainty measurement, as well as the performance of the learning policy. QDQ consistently exhibits strong performance in the D4RL benchmark and shows significant improvements for many tasks. Our code can be found at <code link>."
