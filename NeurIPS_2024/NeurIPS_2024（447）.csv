Poster,What Matters in Graph Class Incremental Learning? An Information Preservation Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93344,"Jialu Li, Yu Wang, Pengfei Zhu, Wanyu Lin, Qinghua Hu","Graph class incremental learning (GCIL) requires the model to classify emerging nodes of new classes while remembering old classes. Existing methods are designed to preserve effective information of old models or graph data to alleviate forgetting, but there is no clear theoretical understanding of what matters in information preservation. In this paper, we consider that present practice suffers from high semantic and structural shifts assessed by two devised shift metrics. We provide insights into information preservation in GCIL and find that maintaining graph information can preserve information of old models in theory to calibrate node semantic and graph structure shifts. We correspond graph information into low-frequency local-global information and high-frequency information in spatial domain. Based on the analysis, we propose a framework, Graph Spatial Information Preservation (GSIP). Specifically, for low-frequency information preservation, the old node representations obtained by inputting replayed nodes into the old model are aligned with the outputs of the node and its neighbors in the new model, and then old and new outputs are globally matched after pooling. For high-frequency information preservation, the new node representations are encouraged to imitate the near-neighbor pair similarity of old node representations. GSIP achieves a 10\% increase in terms of the forgetting metric compared to prior methods on large-scale datasets. Our framework can also seamlessly integrate existing replay designs. The code is available through https://github.com/Jillian555/GSIP."
Poster,What matters when building vision-language models?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94309,"Hugo Laurençon, Leo Tronchon, Matthieu Cord, Victor Sanh","The growing interest in vision-language models (VLMs) has been driven by improvements in large language models and vision transformers. Despite the abundance of literature on this subject, we observe that critical decisions regarding the design of VLMs are often not justified. We argue that these unsupported decisions impede progress in the field by making it difficult to identify which choices improve model performance. To address this issue, we conduct extensive experiments around pre-trained models, architecture choice, data, and training methods. Our consolidation of findings includes the development of Idefics2, an efficient foundational VLM of 8 billion parameters. Idefics2 achieves state-of-the-art performance within its size category across various multimodal benchmarks, and is often on par with models four times its size. We release the model (base, instructed, and chat) along with the datasets created for its training."
Poster,What Rotary Position Embedding Can Tell Us: Identifying Query and Key Weights Corresponding to Basic Syntactic or High-level Semantic Information,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94296,"Yiting Chen, Junchi Yan","Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have successfully handled various tasks. As one fundamental module in Transformers, position encoding encodes the positional information of tokens in a sequence. Specifically, rotary position embedding (RoPE), one of the most widely used techniques, encodes the positional information by dividing the query or key value with $d$ elements into $d/2$ pairs and rotating the 2d vectors corresponding to each pair of elements. Therefore, the direction of each pair and the position-related rotation jointly determine the attention score. In this paper, we show that the direction of the 2d pair is largely affected by the angle between the corresponding weight vector pair. We theoretically show that non-orthogonal weight vector pairs lead to great attention on tokens at a certain relative position and are less sensitive to the input which may correspond to basic syntactic information. Meanwhile, the orthogonal weight vector pairs are more flexible regarding the relative position, which may correspond to high-level syntactic information. Empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that shallow layers of LLMs focus more on local syntax and deep layers focus more on high-level semantics. Furthermore, we show that LLMs fine-tuning mainly changes the pairs of weight vectors that are nearly orthogonal, i.e., the weight corresponding to high-level semantics, which enables the reduction of the number of trainable parameters during fine-tuning without sacrificing performance. We propose a method namely Angle-based Weight Selection (AWS) to reduce the fine-tuning overhead and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on widely used Alpaca fine-tuned Llama-2."
Poster,What to Say and When to Say it: Live Fitness Coaching as a Testbed for Situated Interaction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97489,"Sunny Panchal, Apratim Bhattacharyya, Guillaume Berger, Antoine Mercier, Cornelius Böhm, Florian Dietrichkeit, Reza Pourreza, Xuanlin Li, Pulkit Madan, Mingu Lee, Mark Todorovich, Ingo Bax, Roland Memisevic","Vision-language models have shown impressive progress in recent years. However, existing models are largely limited to turn-based interactions, where each turn must be stepped (i.e., prompted) by the user. Open-ended, asynchronous interactions, where an AI model may proactively deliver timely responses or feedback based on the unfolding situation in real-time, are an open challenge. In this work, we present the QEVD benchmark and dataset, which explores human-AI interaction in the challenging, yet controlled, real-world domain of fitness coaching – a task which intrinsically requires monitoring live user activity and providing immediate feedback. The benchmark requires vision-language models to recognize complex human actions, identify possible mistakes, and provide appropriate feedback in real-time. Our experiments reveal the limitations of existing state-of-the-art vision-language models for such asynchronous situated interactions. Motivated by this, we propose a simple end-to-end streaming baseline that can respond asynchronously to human actions with appropriate feedback at the appropriate time."
Poster,What type of inference is planning?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95030,"Miguel Lazaro-Gredilla, Li Ku, Kevin Murphy, Dileep George","Multiple types of inference are available for probabilistic graphical models, e.g., marginal, maximum-a-posteriori, and even marginal maximum-a-posteriori. Which one do researchers mean when they talk about ``planning as inference''? There is no consistency in the literature, different types are used, and their ability to do planning is further entangled with specific approximations or additional constraints. In this work we use the variational framework to show that, just like all commonly used types of inference correspond to different weightings of the entropy terms in the variational problem, planning corresponds _exactly_ to a _different_ set of weights. This means that all the tricks of variational inference are readily applicable to planning. We develop an analogue of loopy belief propagation that allows us to perform approximate planning in factored-state Markov decisions processes without incurring intractability due to the exponentially large state space. The variational perspective shows that the previous types of inference for planning are only adequate in environments with low stochasticity, and allows us to characterize each type by its own merits, disentangling the type of inference from the additional approximations that its practical use requires. We validate these results empirically on synthetic MDPs and tasks posed in the International Planning Competition."
Poster,What Variables Affect Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Pretrained Models?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93557,"Md Yousuf Harun, Kyungbok Lee, Gianmarco Gallardo, Giri Krishnan, Christopher Kanan","Embeddings produced by pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used; however, their efficacy for downstream tasks can vary widely. We study the factors influencing transferability and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of pre-trained DNN embeddings through the lens of the tunnel effect hypothesis, which is closely related to intermediate neural collapse. This hypothesis suggests that deeper DNN layers compress representations and hinder OOD generalization. Contrary to earlier work, our experiments show this is not a universal phenomenon. We comprehensively investigate the impact of DNN architecture, training data, image resolution, and augmentations on transferability. We identify that training with high-resolution datasets containing many classes greatly reduces representation compression and improves transferability. Our results emphasize the danger of generalizing findings from toy datasets to broader contexts."
Poster,When are dynamical systems learned from time series data statistically accurate?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96626,"Jeongjin Park, Nicole Yang, Nisha Chandramoorthy","Conventional notions of generalization often fail to describe the ability of learned models to capture meaningful information from dynamical data. A neural network that learns complex dynamics with a small test error may still fail to reproduce its \emph{physical} behavior, including associated statistical moments and Lyapunov exponents. To address this gap, we propose an ergodic theoretic approach to generalization of complex dynamical models learned from time series data. Our main contribution is to define and analyze generalization of a broad suite of neural representations of classes of ergodic systems, including chaotic systems, in a way that captures emulating underlying invariant, physical measures. Our results provide theoretical justification for why regression methods for generators of dynamical systems (Neural ODEs) fail to generalize, and why their statistical accuracy improves upon adding Jacobian information during training. We verify our results on a number of ergodic chaotic systems and neural network parameterizations, including MLPs, ResNets, Fourier Neural layers, and RNNs."
Poster,When does perceptual alignment benefit vision representations?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95412,"Shobhita Sundaram, Stephanie Fu, Lukas Muttenthaler, Netanel Tamir, Lucy Chai, Simon Kornblith, Trevor Darrell, Phillip Isola","Humans judge perceptual similarity according to diverse visual attributes, including scene layout, subject location, and camera pose. Existing vision models understand a wide range of semantic abstractions but improperly weigh these attributes and thus make inferences misaligned with human perception. While vision representations have previously benefited from human preference alignment in contexts like image generation, the utility of perceptually aligned representations in more general-purpose settings remains unclear. Here, we investigate how aligning vision model representations to human perceptual judgments impacts their usability in standard computer vision tasks. We finetune state-of-the-art models on a dataset of human similarity judgments for synthetic image triplets and evaluate them across diverse computer vision tasks. We find that aligning models to perceptual judgments yields representations that improve upon the original backbones across many downstream tasks, including counting, semantic segmentation, depth estimation, instance retrieval, and retrieval-augmented generation. In addition, we find that performance is widely preserved on other tasks, including specialized out-of-distribution domains such as in medical imaging and 3D environment frames. Our results suggest that injecting an inductive bias about human perceptual knowledge into vision models can make them better representation learners."
Poster,When is an Embedding Model  More Promising than Another?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94873,"Maxime Darrin, Philippe Formont, Ismail Ayed, Jackie CK Cheung, Pablo Piantanida","Embedders play a central role in machine learning, projecting any object into numerical representations that can, in turn, be leveraged to perform various downstream tasks. The evaluation of embedding models typically depends on domain-specific empirical approaches utilizing downstream tasks, primarily because of the lack of a standardized framework for comparison. However, acquiring adequately large and representative datasets for conducting these assessments is not always viable and can prove to be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming.  In this paper, we present a unified approach to evaluate embedders. First, we establish theoretical foundations for comparing embedding models, drawing upon the concepts of sufficiency and informativeness. We then leverage these concepts to devise a tractable comparison criterion (information sufficiency), leading to a task-agnostic and self-supervised ranking procedure. We demonstrate experimentally that our approach aligns closely with the capability of embedding models to facilitate various downstream tasks in both natural language processing and molecular biology. This effectively offers practitioners a valuable tool for prioritizing model trials."
Poster,When Is Inductive Inference Possible?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96809,Zhou Lu,"Can a physicist make only a finite number of errors in the eternal quest to uncover the law of nature?This millennium-old philosophical problem, known as inductive inference, lies at the heart of epistemology.Despite its significance to understanding human reasoning, a rigorous justification of inductive inference has remained elusive.At a high level, inductive inference asks whether one can make at most finite errors amidst an infinite sequence of observations, when deducing the correct hypothesis from a given hypothesis class.Historically, the only theoretical guarantee has been that if the hypothesis class is countable, inductive inference is possible, as exemplified by Solomonoff induction for learning Turing machines.In this paper, we provide a tight characterization of inductive inference by establishing a novel link to online learning theory.As our main result, we prove that inductive inference is possible if and only if the hypothesis class is a countable union of online learnable classes, potentially with an uncountable size, no matter the observations are adaptively chosen or iid sampled.Moreover, the same condition is also sufficient and necessary in the agnostic setting, where any hypothesis class meeting this criterion enjoys an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for any time step $T$, while others require an arbitrarily slow rate of regret.Our main technical tool is a novel non-uniform online learning framework, which may be of independent interest.Our main technical tool is a novel non-uniform online learning framework, which may be of independent interest."
