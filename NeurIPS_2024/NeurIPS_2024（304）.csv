Poster,Parameter Disparities Dissection for Backdoor Defense in Heterogeneous Federated Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94163,"Wenke Huang, Mang Ye, Zekun Shi, Guancheng Wan, He Li, Bo Du","Backdoor attacks pose a serious threat to federated systems, where malicious clients optimize on the triggered distribution to mislead the global model towards a predefined target. Existing backdoor defense methods typically require either homogeneous assumption, validation datasets, or client optimization conflicts. In our work, we observe that benign heterogeneous distributions and malicious triggered distributions exhibit distinct parameter importance degrees. We introduce the Fisher Discrepancy Cluster and Rescale (FDCR) method, which utilizes Fisher Information to calculate the degree of parameter importance for local distributions. This allows us to reweight client parameter updates and identify those with large discrepancies as backdoor attackers. Furthermore, we prioritize rescaling important parameters to expedite adaptation to the target distribution, encouraging significant elements to contribute more while diminishing the influence of trivial ones. This approach enables FDCR to handle backdoor attacks in heterogeneous federated learning environments. Empirical results on various heterogeneous federated scenarios under backdoor attacks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
Poster,Parameter Efficient Adaptation for Image Restoration with Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95197,"Hang Guo, Tao Dai, Yuanchao Bai, Bin Chen, Xudong Ren, Zexuan Zhu, Shu-Tao Xia","Designing single-task image restoration models for specific degradation has seen great success in recent years. To achieve generalized image restoration, all-in-one methods have recently been proposed and shown potential for multiple restoration tasks using one single model. Despite the promising results, the existing all-in-one paradigm still suffers from high computational costs as well as limited generalization on unseen degradations. In this work, we introduce an alternative solution to improve the generalization of image restoration models. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in Parameter Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL), we aim to tune only a small number of parameters to adapt pre-trained restoration models to various tasks. However, current PETL methods fail to generalize across varied restoration tasks due to their homogeneous representation nature. To this end, we propose AdaptIR, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with orthogonal multi-branch design to capture local spatial, global spatial, and channel representation bases, followed by adaptive base combination to obtain heterogeneous representation for different degradations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our AdaptIR achieves stable performance on single-degradation tasks, and excels in hybrid-degradation tasks, with training only 0.6% parameters for 8 hours."
Poster,Parameter-free Clipped Gradient Descent Meets Polyak,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95113,"Yuki Takezawa, Han Bao, Ryoma Sato, Kenta Niwa, Makoto Yamada","Gradient descent and its variants are de facto standard algorithms for training machine learning models. As gradient descent is sensitive to its hyperparameters, we need to tune the hyperparameters carefully using a grid search. However, the method is time-consuming, particularly when multiple hyperparameters exist. Therefore, recent studies have analyzed parameter-free methods that adjust the hyperparameters on the fly. However, the existing work is limited to investigations of parameter-free methods for the stepsize, and parameter-free methods for other hyperparameters have not been explored. For instance, although the gradient clipping threshold is a crucial hyperparameter in addition to the stepsize for preventing gradient explosion issues, none of the existing studies have investigated parameter-free methods for clipped gradient descent. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the parameter-free methods for clipped gradient descent. Specifically, we propose Inexact Polyak Stepsize, which converges to the optimal solution without any hyperparameters tuning, and its convergence rate is asymptotically independent of $L$ under $L$-smooth and $(L_0, L_1)$-smooth assumptions of the loss function, similar to that of clipped gradient descent with well-tuned hyperparameters. We numerically validated our convergence results using a synthetic function and demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methods using LSTM, Nano-GPT, and T5."
Poster,Parameter-Inverted Image Pyramid Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95447,"Xizhou Zhu, Xue Yang, Zhaokai Wang, Hao Li, Wenhan Dou, Junqi Ge, Lewei Lu, Yu Qiao, Jifeng Dai","Image pyramids are commonly used in modern computer vision tasks to obtain multi-scale features for precise understanding of images. However, image pyramids process multiple resolutions of images using the same large-scale model, which requires significant computational cost. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel network architecture known as the Parameter-Inverted Image Pyramid Networks (PIIP). Our core idea is to use models with different parameter sizes to process different resolution levels of the image pyramid, thereby balancing computational efficiency and performance. Specifically, the input to PIIP is a set of multi-scale images, where higher resolution images are processed by smaller networks. We further propose a feature interaction mechanism to allow features of different resolutions to complement each other and effectively integrate information from different spatial scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the PIIP achieves superior performance in tasks such as object detection, segmentation, and image classification, compared to traditional image pyramid methods and single-branch networks, while reducing computational cost. Notably, when applying our method on a large-scale vision foundation model InternViT-6B, we improve its performance by 1\%-2\% on detection and segmentation with only 40\%-60\% of the original computation. These results validate the effectiveness of the PIIP approach and provide a new technical direction for future vision computing tasks."
Poster,Parameterized Approximation Schemes for Fair-Range Clustering,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94597,"Zhen Zhang, Xiaohong Chen, Limei Liu, Jie Chen, Junyu Huang, Qilong Feng","Fair-range clustering extends classical clustering formulations by associating each data point with one or more demographic labels. It imposes lower and upper bound constraints on the number of facilities opened for each label, ensuring fair representation of all demographic groups by the selected facilities. In this paper we focus on the fair-range $k$-median and $k$-means problems in Euclidean spaces. We give $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithms with fixed-parameter tractable running times for both problems, parameterized by the numbers of opened facilities and demographic labels. For Euclidean metrics, these are the first parameterized approximation schemes for the problems, improving upon the previously known $O(1)$-approximation ratios given by Thejaswi et al. (KDD 2022)."
Poster,Parameter Symmetry and Noise Equilibrium of Stochastic Gradient Descent,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93254,"Liu Ziyin, Mingze Wang, Hongchao Li, Lei Wu","Symmetries are prevalent in deep learning and can significantly influence the learning dynamics of neural networks. In this paper, we examine how exponential symmetries -- a broad subclass of continuous symmetries present in the model architecture or loss function -- interplay with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We first prove that gradient noise creates a systematic motion (a ``Noether flow"") of the parameters $\theta$ along the degenerate direction to a unique initialization-independent fixed point $\theta^*$. These points are referred to as the noise equilibria because, at these points, noise contributions from different directions are balanced and aligned. Then, we show that the balance and alignment of gradient noise can serve as a novel alternative mechanism for explaining important phenomena such as progressive sharpening/flattening and representation formation within neural networks and have practical implications for understanding techniques like representation normalization and warmup."
Poster,Parametric model reduction of mean-field and stochastic systems via higher-order action matching,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93463,"Jules Berman, Tobias Blickhan, Benjamin Peherstorfer","The aim of this work is to learn models of population dynamics of physical systems that feature stochastic and mean-field effects and that depend on physics parameters. The learned models can act as surrogates of classical numerical models to efficiently predict the system behavior over the physics parameters. Building on the Benamou-Brenier formula from optimal transport and action matching, we use a variational problem to infer parameter- and time-dependent gradient fields that represent approximations of the population dynamics. The inferred gradient fields can then be used to rapidly generate sample trajectories that mimic the dynamics of the physical system on a population level over varying physics parameters. We show that combining Monte Carlo sampling with higher-order quadrature rules is critical for accurately estimating the training objective from sample data and for stabilizing the training process. We demonstrate on Vlasov-Poisson instabilities as well as on high-dimensional particle and chaotic systems that our approach accurately predicts population dynamics over a wide range of parameters and outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based and flow-based modeling that simply condition on time and physics parameters."
Poster,Pard: Permutation-Invariant Autoregressive Diffusion for Graph Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93104,"Lingxiao Zhao, Xueying Ding, Leman Akoglu","Graph generation has been dominated by autoregressive models due to their simplicity and effectiveness, despite their sensitivity to ordering. Yet diffusion models have garnered increasing attention, as they offer comparable performance while being permutation-invariant. Current graph diffusion models generate graphs in a one-shot fashion, but they require extra features and thousands of denoising steps to achieve optimal performance. We introduce PARD, a Permutation-invariant Auto Regressive Diffusion model that integrates diffusion models with autoregressive methods. PARD harnesses the effectiveness and efficiency of the autoregressive model while maintaining permutation invariance without ordering sensitivity. Specifically, we show that contrary to sets, elements in a graph are not entirely un-ordered and there is a unique partial order for nodes and edges. With this partial order, PARD generates a graph in a block-by-block, autoregressive fashion, where each block’s probability is conditionally modeled by a shared diffusion model with an equivariant network. To ensure efficiency while being expressive, we further propose a higher-order graph transformer, which integrates transformer with PPGN (Maronet al., 2019). Like GPT, we extend the higher-order graph transformer to support parallel training of all blocks. Without any extra features, PARD achieves state-of-the-art performance on molecular and non-molecular datasets, and scales to large datasets like MOSES containing 1.9M molecules."
Poster,Parseval Regularization for Continual Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95192,"Wesley Chung, Lynn Cherif, Doina Precup, David Meger","Plasticity loss, trainability loss, and primacy bias have been identified as issues arising when training deep neural networks on sequences of tasks---referring to the increased difficulty in training on new tasks.We propose to use Parseval regularization, which maintains orthogonality of weight matrices, to preserve useful optimization properties and improve training in a continual reinforcement learning setting.We show that it provides significant benefits to RL agents on a suite of gridworld, CARL and MetaWorld tasks.We conduct comprehensive ablations to identify the source of its benefits and investigate the effect of certain metrics associated to network trainability including weight matrix rank, weight norms and policy entropy."
Poster,Parsimony or Capability? Decomposition Delivers Both in Long-term Time Series Forecasting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93133,"Jinliang Deng, Feiyang Ye, Du Yin, Xuan Song, Ivor Tsang, Hui Xiong","Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) represents a critical frontier in time series analysis, characterized by extensive input sequences, as opposed to the shorter spans typical of traditional approaches. While longer sequences inherently offer richer information for enhanced predictive precision, prevailing studies often respond by escalating model complexity. These intricate models can inflate into millions of parameters, resulting in prohibitive parameter scales. Our study demonstrates, through both theoretical and empirical evidence, that decomposition is key to containing excessive model inflation while achieving uniformly superior and robust results across various datasets. Remarkably, by tailoring decomposition to the intrinsic dynamics of time series data, our proposed model outperforms existing benchmarks, using over 99\% fewer parameters than the majority of competing methods. Through this work, we aim to unleash the power of a restricted set of parameters by capitalizing on domain characteristics—a timely reminder that in the realm of LTSF, bigger is not invariably better.
