Poster,CausalDiff: Causality-Inspired Disentanglement via Diffusion Model for Adversarial Defense,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96186,"Mingkun Zhang, Keping Bi, Wei Chen, Quanrun Chen, Jiafeng Guo, Xueqi Cheng","Despite ongoing efforts to defend neural classifiers from adversarial attacks, they remain vulnerable, especially to unseen attacks. In contrast, humans are difficult to be cheated by subtle manipulations, since we make judgments only based on essential factors. Inspired by this observation, we attempt to model label generation with essential label-causative factors and incorporate label-non-causative factors to assist data generation. For an adversarial example, we aim to discriminate the perturbations as non-causative factors and make predictions only based on the label-causative factors. Concretely, we propose a casual diffusion model (CausalDiff) that adapts diffusion models for conditional data generation and disentangles the two types of casual factors by learning towards a novel casual information bottleneck objective. Empirically, CausalDiff has significantly outperformed state-of-the-art defense methods on various unseen attacks, achieving an average robustness of 86.39\% (+4.01\%) on CIFAR-10, 56.25\% (+3.13\%) on CIFAR-100, and 82.62\% (+4.93\%) on GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark).

Poster,Causal Discovery from Event Sequences by Local Cause-Effect Attribution,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93036,"Joscha Cüppers, Sascha Xu, Ahmed Musa, Jilles Vreeken","Sequences of events, such as crashes in the stock market or outages in a network, contain strong temporal dependencies, whose understanding is crucial to react to and influence future events. In this paper, we study the problem of discovering the underlying causal structure from event sequences. To this end, we introduce a new causal model, where individual events of the cause trigger events of the effect with dynamic delays. We show that in contrast to existing methods based on Granger causality, our model is identifiable for both instant and delayed effects.We base our approach on the Algorithmic Markov Condition, by which we identify the true causal network as the one that minimizes the Kolmogorov complexity. As the Kolmogorov complexity is not computable, we instantiate our model using Minimum Description Length and show that the resulting score identifies the causal direction. To discover causal graphs, we introduce the Cascade algorithm, which adds edges in topological order. Extensive evaluation shows that Cascade outperforms existing methods in settings with instantaneous effects, noise, and multiple colliders, and discovers insightful causal graphs on real-world data."
Poster,Causal discovery with endogenous context variables,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94414,"Wiebke Günther, Oana-Iuliana Popescu, Martin Rabel, Urmi Ninad, Andreas Gerhardus, Jakob Runge","Systems with variations of the underlying generating mechanism between different contexts, i.e., different environments or internal states  in which the system operates, are common in the real world, such as soil moisture regimes in Earth science. Besides understanding the shared properties of the system, in practice, the question of context-specific properties, i.e., the change in causal relationships between contexts, arises. For real-world data, contexts are often driven by system variables, e.g., precipitation highly influences soil moisture. Nevertheless, this setup needs to be studied more. To account for such endogenous contexts in causal discovery, our work proposes a constraint-based method that can efficiently discover context-specific causal graphs using an adaptive testing approach. Our approach tests conditional independence on the pooled datasets to infer the dependence between system variables, including the context, to avoid introducing selection bias. To yield context-specific insights, conditional independence is tested on context-specific data. We work out the theoretical framework for this adaptive testing approach and give a detailed discussion of the connection to structural causal models, including sufficiency assumptions, which allow to prove the soundness of our algorithm and to interpret the results causally. A simulation study to evaluate numerical properties shows that our approach  behaves as expected, but also leads to a further understanding of current limitations and viable extensions."
Poster,Causal Effect Identification in a Sub-Population with Latent Variables,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94018,"Amir Mohammad Abouei, Ehsan Mokhtarian, Negar Kiyavash, Matthias Grossglauser","The s-ID problem seeks to compute a causal effect in a specific sub-population from the observational data pertaining to the same sub population (Abouei et al., 2023). This problem has been addressed when all the variables in the system are observable. In this paper, we consider an extension of the s-ID problem that allows for the presence of latent variables. To tackle the challenges induced by the presence of latent variables in a sub-population, we first extend the classical relevant graphical definitions, such as c-components and Hedges, initially defined for the so-called ID problem (Pearl, 1995; Tian & Pearl, 2002), to their new counterparts. Subsequently, we propose a sound algorithm for the s-ID problem with latent variables."
Poster,Causal Imitation for Markov Decision Processes: a Partial Identification Approach,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95675,"Kangrui Ruan, Junzhe Zhang, Xuan Di, Elias Bareinboim","Imitation learning enables an agent to learn from expert demonstrations when the performance measure is unknown and the reward signal is not specified. Standard imitation methods do not generally apply when the learner and the expert's sensory capabilities mismatch and demonstrations are contaminated with unobserved confounding bias. To address these challenges, recent advancements in causal imitation learning have been pursued. However, these methods often require access to underlying causal structures that might not always be available, posing practical challenges.In this paper, we investigate robust imitation learning within the framework of canonical Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) using partial identification, allowing the agent to achieve expert performance even when the system dynamics are not uniquely determined from the confounded expert demonstrations. Specifically, first, we theoretically demonstrate that when unobserved confounders (UCs) exist in an MDP, the learner is generally unable to imitate expert performance. We then explore imitation learning in partially identifiable settings --- either transition distribution or reward function is non-identifiable from the available data and knowledge. Augmenting the celebrated GAIL method (Ho \& Ermon, 2016), our analysis leads to two novel causal imitation algorithms that can obtain effective policies guaranteed to achieve expert performance."
Poster,Causal Inference in the Closed-Loop: Marginal Structural Models for Sequential Excursion Effects,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96183,"Alexander Levis, Gabriel Loewinger, Francisco Pereira","Optogenetics is widely used to study the effects of neural circuit manipulation on behavior. However, the paucity of causal inference methodological work on this topic has resulted in analysis conventions that discard information, and constrain the scientific questions that can be posed. To fill this gap, we introduce a nonparametric causal inference framework for analyzing ""closed-loop"" designs, which use dynamic policies that assign treatment based on covariates. In this setting, standard methods can introduce bias and occlude causal effects. Building on the sequentially randomized experiments literature in causal inference, our approach extends history-restricted marginal structural models for dynamic regimes. In practice, our framework can identify a wide range of causal effects of optogenetics on trial-by-trial behavior, such as, fast/slow-acting, dose-response, additive/antagonistic, and floor/ceiling. Importantly, it does so without requiring negative controls, and can estimate how causal effect magnitudes evolve across time points. From another view, our work extends ""excursion effect"" methods---popular in the mobile health literature---to enable estimation of causal contrasts for treatment sequences greater than length one, in the presence of positivity violations. We derive rigorous statistical guarantees, enabling hypothesis testing of these causal effects. We demonstrate our approach on data from a recent study of dopaminergic activity on learning, and show how our method reveals relevant effects obscured in standard analyses."
Poster,Causal language modeling can elicit search and reasoning capabilities on logic puzzles,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94030,"Kulin Shah, Nishanth Dikkala, Xin Wang, Rina Panigrahy","Causal language modeling using the Transformer architecture has yielded remarkable capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) over the last few years. However, the extent to which fundamental search and reasoning capabilities emerged within LLMs remains a topic of ongoing debate. In this work, we study if causal language modeling can learn a complex task such as solving Sudoku puzzles. To solve a Sudoku, the model is first required to search over all empty cells of the puzzle to decide on a cell to fill and then apply an appropriate strategy to fill the decided cell. Sometimes, the application of a strategy only results in thinning down the possible values in a cell rather than concluding the exact value of the cell. In such cases, multiple strategies are applied one after the other to fill a single cell. We observe that Transformer models trained on this synthetic task can indeed learn to solve Sudokus (our model solves $94.21\%$ of the puzzles fully correctly) when trained on a logical sequence of steps taken by a solver. We find that training Transformers with the logical sequence of steps is necessary and without such training, they fail to learn Sudoku. We also extend our analysis to Zebra puzzles (known as Einstein puzzles) and show that the model solves $92.04 \%$ of the puzzles fully correctly. In addition, we study the internal representations of the trained Transformer and find that through linear probing, we can decode information about the set of possible values in any given cell from them, pointing to the presence of a strong reasoning engine implicit in the Transformer weights."
Poster,Causal-learn: Causal Discovery in Python,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/98316,"Yujia Zheng, Biwei Huang, Wei Chen, Joseph D Ramsey, Mingming Gong, Ruichu Cai, Shohei Shimizu, Peter Spirtes, Kun Zhang","Causal discovery aims at revealing causal relations from observational data, which is a fundamental task in science and engineering. We describe causal-learn, an open-source Python library for causal discovery. This library focuses on bringing a comprehensive collection of causal discovery methods to both practitioners and researchers. It provides easy-to-use APIs for non-specialists, modular building blocks for developers, detailed documentation for learners, and comprehensive methods for all. Different from previous packages in R or Java, causal-learn is fully developed in Python, which could be more in tune with the recent preference shift in programming languages within related communities. The library is available at https://github.com/py-why/causal-learn."
Poster,CausalStock: Deep End-to-end Causal Discovery for News-driven Multi-stock Movement Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96607,"Shuqi Li, Yuebo Sun, Yuxin Lin, Xin Gao, Shuo Shang, Rui Yan","There are two issues in news-driven multi-stock movement prediction tasks that are not well solved in the existing works. On the one hand, ""relation discovery"" is a pivotal part when leveraging the price information of other stocks to achieve accurate stock movement prediction. Given that stock relations are often unidirectional, such as the ""supplier-consumer"" relationship, causal relations are more appropriate to capture the impact between stocks. On the other hand, there is substantial noise existing in the news data leading to extracting effective information with difficulty. With these two issues in mind, we propose a novel framework called CausalStock for news-driven multi-stock movement prediction, which discovers the temporal causal relations between stocks. We design a lag-dependent temporal causal discovery mechanism to model the temporal causal graph distribution. Then a Functional Causal Model is employed to encapsulate the discovered causal relations and predict the stock movements. Additionally, we propose a Denoised News Encoder by taking advantage of the excellent text evaluation ability of large language models (LLMs) to extract useful information from massive news data. The experiment results show that CausalStock outperforms the strong baselines for both news-driven multi-stock movement prediction and multi-stock movement prediction tasks on six real-world datasets collected from the US, China, Japan, and UK markets. Moreover, getting benefit from the causal relations, CausalStock could offer a clear prediction mechanism with good explainability."
Poster,Causal Temporal Representation Learning with Nonstationary Sparse Transition,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95735,"Xiangchen Song, Zijian Li, Guangyi Chen, Yujia Zheng, Yewen Fan, Xinshuai Dong, Kun Zhang","Causal Temporal Representation Learning (Ctrl) methods aim to identify the temporal causal dynamics of complex nonstationary temporal sequences. Despite the success of existing Ctrl methods, they require either directly observing the domain variables or assuming a Markov prior on them. Such requirements limit the application of these methods in real-world scenarios when we do not have such prior knowledge of the domain variables. To address this problem, this work adopts a sparse transition assumption, aligned with intuitive human understanding, and presents identifiability results from a theoretical perspective. In particular, we explore under what conditions on the significance of the variability of the transitions we can build a model to identify the distribution shifts. Based on the theoretical result, we introduce a novel framework, *Causal Temporal Representation Learning with Nonstationary Sparse Transition* (CtrlNS), designed to leverage the constraints on transition sparsity and conditional independence to reliably identify both distribution shifts and latent factors. Our experimental evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach."
