Poster,Accelerating Non-Maximum Suppression: A Graph Theory Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96910,"King-Siong Si, Lu Sun, Weizhan Zhang, Tieliang Gong, Jiahao Wang, Jiang Liu, Hao Sun","Non-maximum suppression (NMS) is an indispensable post-processing step in object detection. With the continuous optimization of network models, NMS has become the ``last mile'' to enhance the efficiency of object detection. This paper systematically analyzes NMS from a graph theory perspective for the first time, revealing its intrinsic structure. Consequently, we propose two optimization methods, namely QSI-NMS and BOE-NMS. The former is a fast recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm with negligible mAP loss, and its extended version (eQSI-NMS) achieves optimal complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$. The latter, concentrating on the locality of NMS, achieves an optimization at a constant level without an mAP loss penalty. Moreover, to facilitate rapid evaluation of NMS methods for researchers, we introduce NMS-Bench, the first benchmark designed to comprehensively assess various NMS methods. Taking the YOLOv8-N model on MS COCO 2017 as the benchmark setup, our method QSI-NMS provides $6.2\times$ speed of original NMS on the benchmark, with a $0.1\%$ decrease in mAP. The optimal eQSI-NMS, with only a $0.3\%$ mAP decrease, achieves $10.7\times$ speed. Meanwhile, BOE-NMS exhibits $5.1\times$ speed with no compromise in mAP."
Poster,Accelerating Pre-training of Multimodal LLMs via Chain-of-Sight,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95674,"Ziyuan Huang, Kaixiang Ji, Biao Gong, Zhiwu Qing, Qinglong Zhang, Kecheng Zheng, Jian Wang, Jingdong Chen, Ming Yang","This paper introduces Chain-of-Sight, a vision-language bridge module that accelerates the pre-training of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our approach employs a sequence of visual resamplers that capture visual details at various spacial scales.This architecture not only leverages global and local visual contexts effectively, but also facilitates the flexible extension of visual tokens through a compound token scaling strategy, allowing up to a 16x increase in the token count post pre-training.Consequently, Chain-of-Sight requires significantly fewer visual tokens in the pre-training phase compared to the fine-tuning phase. This intentional reduction of visual tokens during pre-training notably accelerates the pre-training process, cutting down the wall-clock training time by $\sim$73\%.Empirical results on a series of vision-language benchmarks reveal that the pre-train acceleration through Chain-of-Sight is achieved without sacrificing performance, matching or surpassing the standard pipeline of utilizing all visual tokens throughout the entire training process. Further scaling up the number of visual tokens for pre-training leads to stronger performances, competitive to existing approaches in a series of benchmarks."
Poster,Accelerating Relative Entropy Coding with Space Partitioning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95340,"Jiajun He, Gergely Flamich, José Miguel Hernández-Lobato","Relative entropy coding (REC) algorithms encode a random sample following a target distribution $Q$, using a coding distribution $P$ shared between the sender and receiver. Sadly, general REC algorithms suffer from prohibitive encoding times, at least on the order of  $2^{D_{\text{KL}}[Q||P]}$, and faster algorithms are limited to very specific settings. This work addresses this issue by introducing a REC scheme utilizing space partitioning to reduce runtime in practical scenarios. We provide theoretical analyses of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness with both toy examples and practical applications. Notably, our method successfully handles REC tasks with $D_{\text{KL}}[Q||P]$ about three times greater than what previous methods can manage, and reduces the bitrate by approximately 5-15\% in VAE-based lossless compression on MNIST and INR-based lossy compression on CIFAR-10, compared to previous methods, significantly improving the practicality of REC for neural compression."
Poster,Accelerating Transformers with Spectrum-Preserving Token Merging,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95316,"Chau Tran, Duy M. H. Nguyen, Manh-Duy Nguyen, TrungTin Nguyen, Ngan Le, Pengtao Xie, Daniel Sonntag, James Zou, Binh Nguyen, Mathias Niepert","Increasing the throughput of the Transformer architecture, a foundational component used in numerous state-of-the-art models for vision and language tasks (e.g., GPT, LLaVa), is an important problem in machine learning. One recent and effective strategy is to merge token representations within Transformer models, aiming to reduce computational and memory requirements while maintaining accuracy. Prior work has proposed algorithms based on Bipartite Soft Matching (BSM), which divides tokens into distinct sets and merges the top $k$ similar tokens. However, these methods have significant drawbacks, such as sensitivity to token-splitting strategies and damage to informative tokens in later layers. This paper presents a novel paradigm called PiToMe, which prioritizes the preservation of informative tokens using an additional metric termed the \textit{energy score}. This score identifies large clusters of similar tokens as high-energy, indicating potential candidates for merging, while smaller (unique and isolated) clusters are considered as low-energy and preserved. Experimental findings demonstrate that PiToMe saved from 40-60\% FLOPs of the base models while exhibiting superior off-the-shelf performance on image classification (0.5\% average performance drop of ViT-MAEH compared to 2.6\% as baselines), image-text retrieval (0.3\% average performance drop of Clip on Flick30k compared to 4.5\% as others), and analogously in visual questions answering with LLaVa-7B. Furthermore, PiToMe is theoretically shown to preserve intrinsic spectral properties to the original token space under mild conditions."
Poster,Acceleration Exists! Optimization Problems When Oracle Can Only Compare Objective Function Values,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93860,"Aleksandr Lobanov, Alexander Gasnikov, Andrey Krasnov","Frequently, the burgeoning field of black-box optimization encounters challenges due to a limited understanding of the mechanisms of the objective function. To address such problems, in this work we focus on the deterministic concept of Order Oracle, which only utilizes order access between function values (possibly with some bounded noise), but without assuming access to their values. As theoretical results, we propose a new approach to create non-accelerated optimization algorithms (obtained by integrating Order Oracle into existing optimization “tools”) in non-convex, convex, and strongly convex settings that are as good as both SOTA coordinate algorithms with first-order oracle and SOTA algorithms with Order Oracle up to logarithm factor. Moreover, using the proposed approach, _we provide the first accelerated optimization algorithm using the Order Oracle_. And also, using an already different approach we provide the asymptotic convergence of _the first algorithm with the stochastic Order Oracle concept_. Finally, our theoretical results demonstrate effectiveness of proposed algorithms through numerical experiments."
Poster,Accuracy is Not All You Need,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95234,"Abhinav Dutta, Sanjeev Krishnan, Nipun Kwatra, Ramachandran Ramjee","When Large Language Models (LLMs) are compressed using techniques such as quantization, the predominant way to demonstrate the validity of such techniques is by measuring the model's accuracy on various benchmarks. If the accuracies of the baseline model and the compressed model are close, it is assumed that there was negligible degradation in quality. However, even when the accuracy of baseline and compressed model are similar, we observe the phenomenon of flips, wherein answers change from correct to incorrect and vice versa in proportion. We conduct a detailed study of metrics across multiple compression techniques, models and datasets, demonstrating that the behavior of compressed models as visible to end-users is often significantly different from the baseline model, even when accuracy is similar. We further evaluate compressed models qualitatively and quantitatively using MT-Bench and show that compressed models exhibiting high flips are worse than baseline models in this free-form generative task. Thus, we argue that accuracy and perplexity are necessary but not sufficient for evaluating compressed models, since these metrics hide large underlying changes that have not been observed by previous work. Hence, compression techniques should also be evaluated using distance metrics. We propose two such distance metrics, KL-Divergence and flips, and show that they are well correlated."
Poster,Accurate and Steady Inertial Pose Estimation through Sequence Structure Learning and Modulation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93980,"Yinghao Wu, chaoran wang, Lu Yin, Shihui Guo, Yipeng Qin","Transformer models excel at capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data, but lack explicit mechanisms to leverage structural patterns inherent in fixed-length input sequences. In this paper, we propose a novel sequence structure learning and modulation approach that endows Transformers with the ability to model and utilize such fixed-sequence structural properties for improved performance on inertial pose estimation tasks.Specifically, our method introduces a Sequence Structure Module (SSM) that utilizes structural information of fixed-length inertial sensor readings to adjust the input features of transformers.Such structural information can either be acquired by learning or specified based on users' prior knowledge.To justify the prospect of our approach, we show that i) injecting spatial structural information of IMUs/joints learned from data improves accuracy, while ii) injecting temporal structural information based on smooth priors reduces jitter (i.e., improves steadiness), in a spatial-temporal transformer solution for inertial pose estimation.Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art methods and has the potential to advance the design of the transformer architecture for fixed-length sequences."
Poster,ACES: Generating a Diversity of Challenging Programming Puzzles with Autotelic Generative Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95626,"Julien Pourcel, Cédric Colas, Gaia Molinaro, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer, Laetitia Teodorescu","The ability to invent novel and interesting problems is a remarkable feature of human intelligence that drives innovation, art, and science. We propose a method that aims to automate this process by harnessing the power of state-of-the-art generative models to produce a diversity of challenging yet solvable problems, here in the context of Python programming puzzles. Inspired by the intrinsically motivated literature, Autotelic CodE Search (ACES) jointly optimizes for the diversity and difficulty of generated problems. We represent problems in a space of LLM-generated semantic descriptors describing the programming skills required to solve them (e.g. string manipulation, dynamic programming, etc.) and measure their difficulty empirically as a linearly decreasing function of the success rate of \textit{Llama-3-70B}, a state-of-the-art LLM problem solver. ACES iteratively prompts a large language model to generate difficult problems achieving a diversity of target semantic descriptors (goal-directed exploration) using previously generated problems as in-context examples. ACES generates problems that are more diverse and more challenging than problems produced by baseline methods and three times more challenging than problems found in existing Python programming benchmarks on average across 11 state-of-the-art code LLMs."
Poster,ACFun: Abstract-Concrete Fusion Facial Stylization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96106,"Jiapeng Ji, Kun Wei, Ziqi Zhang, Cheng Deng","Owing to advancements in image synthesis techniques, stylization methodologies for large models have garnered remarkable outcomes. However, when it comes to processing facial images, the outcomes frequently fall short of expectations. Facial stylization is predominantly challenged by two significant hurdles. Firstly, obtaining a large dataset of high-quality stylized images is difficult. The scarcity and diversity of artistic styles make it impractical to compile comprehensive datasets for each style. Secondly, while many methods can transfer colors and strokes from style images, these elements alone cannot fully capture a specific style, which encompasses both concrete and abstract visual elements. Additionally, facial stylization often alters the visual features of the face, making it challenging to balance these changes with the need to retain facial information. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called ACFun, which uses only one style image and one facial image for facial stylization. ACFun comprises an Abstract Fusion Module (AFun) and a Concrete Fusion Module (CFun), which separately learn the abstract and concrete features of the style and face. We also design a Face and Style Imagery Alignment Loss to align the style image with the face image in the latent space. Finally, we generate styled facial images from noise directly to complete the facial stylization task. Experiments show that our method outperforms others in facial stylization, producing highly artistic and visually pleasing results."
Poster,Achievable distributional robustness when the robust risk is only partially identified,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95932,"Julia Kostin, Nicola Gnecco, Fanny Yang","In safety-critical applications, machine learning models should generalize well under worst-case distribution shifts, that is, have a small robust risk. Invariance-based algorithms can provably take advantage of structural assumptions on the shifts when the training distributions are heterogeneous enough to identify the robust risk. However, in practice, such identifiability conditions are rarely satisfied – a scenario so far underexplored in the theoretical literature. In this paper, we aim to fill the gap and propose to study the more general setting of partially identifiable robustness. In particular, we define a new risk measure, the identifiable robust risk, and its corresponding (population) minimax quantity that is an algorithm-independent measure for the best achievable robustness under partial identifiability. We introduce these concepts broadly, and then study them within the framework of linear structural causal models for concreteness of the presentation. We use the introduced minimax quantity to show how previous approaches provably achieve suboptimal robustness in the partially identifiable case. We confirm our findings through empirical simulations and real-world experiments and demonstrate how the test error of existing robustness methods grows increasingly suboptimal as the proportion of previously unseen test directions increases."
