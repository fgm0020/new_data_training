Poster,Self-Calibrating Conformal Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96201,"Lars van der Laan, Ahmed Alaa","In machine learning, model calibration and predictive inference are essential for producing reliable predictions and quantifying uncertainty to support decision-making. Recognizing the complementary roles of point and interval predictions, we introduce Self-Calibrating Conformal Prediction, a method that combines Venn-Abers calibration and conformal prediction to deliver calibrated point predictions alongside prediction intervals with finite-sample validity conditional on these predictions. To achieve this, we extend the original Venn-Abers procedure from binary classification to regression. Our theoretical framework supports analyzing conformal prediction methods that involve calibrating model predictions and subsequently constructing conditionally valid prediction intervals on the same data, where the conditioning set or conformity scores may depend on the calibrated predictions. Real-data experiments show that our method improves interval efficiency through model calibration and offers a practical alternative to feature-conditional validity."
Poster,SelfCodeAlign: Self-Alignment for Code Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93079,"Yuxiang Wei, Federico Cassano, Jiawei Liu, Yifeng Ding, Naman Jain, Zachary Mueller, Harm de Vries, Leandro Von Werra, Arjun Guha, LINGMING ZHANG","Instruction tuning is a supervised fine-tuning approach that significantly improves the ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow human instructions. For programming tasks, most models are finetuned with costly human-annotated instruction-response pairs or those generated by large, proprietary LLMs, which may not be permitted. We propose SelfCodeAlign, the first fully transparent and permissive pipeline for self-aligning code LLMs without extensive human annotations or distillation. SelfCodeAlign employs the same base model for inference throughout the data generation process. It first extracts diverse coding concepts from high-quality seed snippets to generate new tasks. It then samples multiple responses per task, pairs each with test cases, and validates them in a sandbox environment. Finally, passing examples are selected for instruction tuning. In our primary experiments, we use SelfCodeAlign with CodeQwen1.5-7B to generate a dataset of 74k instruction-response pairs. Finetuning on this dataset leads to a model that achieves a 67.1 pass@1 on HumanEval+, surpassing CodeLlama-70B-Instruct despite being ten times smaller. Across all benchmarks, this finetuned model consistently outperforms the original version trained with OctoPack, the previous state-of-the-art method for instruction tuning without human annotations or distillation. Additionally, we show that SelfCodeAlign is effective across LLMs of various sizes, from 3B to 33B, and that the base models can benefit more from alignment with their own data distribution. We further validate each component’s effectiveness in our pipeline, showing that SelfCodeAlign outperforms both direct distillation from GPT-4o and leading GPT-3.5-based distillation methods, such as OSS-Instruct and Evol-Instruct. SelfCodeAlign has also led to the creation of StarCoder2-Instruct, the first fully transparent, permissively licensed, and self-aligned code LLM that achieves state-of-the-art coding performance. Overall, SelfCodeAlign shows for the first time that a strong instruction-tuned code LLM can result from self-alignment rather than distillation."
Poster,Self-Consuming Generative Models with Curated Data Provably Optimize Human Preferences,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94368,"Damien Ferbach, Quentin Bertrand, Joey Bose, Gauthier Gidel","The rapid progress in generative models has resulted in impressive leaps in generation quality, blurring the lines between synthetic and real data. Web-scale datasets are now prone to the inevitable contamination by synthetic data, directly impacting the training of future generated models.    Already, some theoretical results on self-consuming generative models (a.k.a., iterative retraining) have emerged in the literature, showcasing that either model collapse or stability could be possible depending on the fraction of generated data used at each retraining step.    However, in practice, synthetic data is often subject to human feedback and curated by users before being used and uploaded online. For instance, many interfaces of popular text-to-image generative models, such as Stable Diffusion or Midjourney, produce several variations of an image for a given query which can eventually be curated by the users.    In this paper, we theoretically study the impact of data curation on iterated retraining of generative models and show that it can be seen as an implicit preference optimization mechanism. However, unlike standard preference optimization, the generative model does not have access to the reward function or negative samples needed for pairwise comparisons. Moreover, our study doesn't require access to the density function, only to samples. We prove that, if the data is curated according to a reward model, then the expected reward of the iterative retraining procedure is maximized. We further provide theoretical results on the stability of the retraining loop when using a positive fraction of real data at each step. Finally, we conduct illustrative experiments on both synthetic datasets and on CIFAR10 showing that such a procedure amplifies biases of the reward model."
Poster,SELF-DISCOVER: Large Language Models Self-Compose Reasoning Structures,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96192,"Pei Zhou, Jay Pujara, Xiang Ren, Xinyun Chen, Heng-Tze Cheng, Quoc V Le, Ed Chi, Denny Zhou, Swaroop Mishra, Huaixiu (Steven) Zheng","We introduce SELF-DISCOVER, a general framework for LLMs to self-discover the task-intrinsic reasoning structures to tackle complex reasoning problems that are challenging for typical prompting methods. Core to the framework is a self-discovery process where LLMs select multiple atomic reasoning modules such as critical thinking and step-by-step thinking, and compose them into an explicit reasoning structure for LLMs to follow during decoding. SELF-DISCOVER substantially improves GPT-4 and PaLM 2’s performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks such as BigBench-Hard, grounded agent reasoning, and MATH, by as much as 32% compared to Chain of Thought (CoT). Furthermore, SELF-DISCOVER outperforms inference-intensive methods such as CoT-Self-Consistency by more than 20%, while requiring 10-40x fewer inference compute. Finally, we show that the self-discovered reasoning structures are universally applicable across model families: from PaLM 2-L to GPT-4, and from GPT-4 to Llama2, and share commonalities with human reasoning patterns."
Poster,Self-Distilled Depth Refinement with Noisy Poisson Fusion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93704,"Jiaqi Li, Yiran Wang, Jinghong Zheng, Zihao Huang, Ke Xian, Zhiguo Cao, Jianming Zhang","Depth refinement aims to infer high-resolution depth with fine-grained edges and details, refining low-resolution results of depth estimation models. The prevailing methods adopt tile-based manners by merging numerous patches, which lacks efficiency and produces inconsistency. Besides, prior arts suffer from fuzzy depth boundaries and limited generalizability. Analyzing the fundamental reasons for these limitations, we model depth refinement as a noisy Poisson fusion problem with local inconsistency and edge deformation noises. We propose the Self-distilled Depth Refinement (SDDR) framework to enforce robustness against the noises, which mainly consists of depth edge representation and edge-based guidance. With noisy depth predictions as input, SDDR generates low-noise depth edge representations as pseudo-labels by coarse-to-fine self-distillation. Edge-based guidance with edge-guided gradient loss and edge-based fusion loss serves as the optimization objective equivalent to Poisson fusion. When depth maps are better refined, the labels also become more noise-free. Our model can acquire strong robustness to the noises, achieving significant improvements in accuracy, edge quality, efficiency, and generalizability on five different benchmarks. Moreover, directly training another model with edge labels produced by SDDR brings improvements, suggesting that our method could help with training robust refinement models in future works."
Poster,Self-Guided Masked Autoencoder,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96408,"Jeongwoo Shin, Inseo Lee, Junho Lee, Joonseok Lee","Masked Autoencoder (MAE) is a self-supervised approach for representation learning, widely applicable to a variety of downstream tasks in computer vision. In spite of its success, it is still not fully uncovered what and how MAE exactly learns. In this paper, with an in-depth analysis, we discover that MAE intrinsically learns pattern-based patch-level clustering from surprisingly early stages of pre-training. Upon this understanding, we propose self-guided masked autoencoder, which internally generates informed mask by utilizing its progress in patch clustering, substituting the naive random masking of the vanilla MAE. Our approach significantly boosts its learning process without relying on any external models or supplementary information, keeping the benefit of self-supervised nature of MAE intact. Comprehensive experiments on various downstream tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."
Poster,Self-Guiding Exploration for Combinatorial Problems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96202,"Zangir Iklassov, Yali Du, Farkhad Akimov, Martin Takac","Large Language Models (LLMs) have become pivotal in addressing reasoning tasks across diverse domains, including arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning. They utilize prompting techniques such as Exploration-of-Thought, Decomposition, and Refinement to effectively navigate and solve intricate tasks. Despite these advancements, the application of LLMs to Combinatorial Problems (CPs), known for their NP-hardness and critical roles in logistics and resource management remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel prompting strategy: Self-Guiding Exploration (SGE), designed to enhance the performance of solving CPs. SGE operates autonomously, generating multiple thought trajectories for each CP task. It then breaks these trajectories down into actionable subtasks, executes them sequentially, and refines the results to ensure optimal outcomes. We present our research as the first to apply LLMs to a broad range of CPs and demonstrate that SGE outperforms existing prompting strategies by over 27.84% in CP optimization performance. Additionally, SGE achieves a 2.46% higher accuracy over the best existing results in other reasoning tasks (arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic)."
Poster,Self-Healing Machine Learning: A Framework for Autonomous Adaptation in Real-World Environments,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94230,"Paulius Rauba, Nabeel Seedat, Krzysztof Kacprzyk, Mihaela van der Schaar","Real-world machine learning systems often encounter model performance degradation due to distributional shifts in the underlying data generating process (DGP). Existing approaches to addressing shifts, such as concept drift adaptation, are limited by their *reason-agnostic* nature. By choosing from a pre-defined set of actions, such methods implicitly assume that the causes of model degradation are irrelevant to what actions should be taken, limiting their ability to select appropriate adaptations. In this paper, we propose an alternative paradigm to overcome these limitations, called *self-healing machine learning* (SHML). Contrary to previous approaches, SHML autonomously diagnoses the reason for degradation and proposes diagnosis-based corrective actions. We formalize SHML as an optimization problem over a space of adaptation actions to minimize the expected risk under the shifted DGP.  We introduce a theoretical framework for self-healing systems and build an agentic self-healing solution *$\mathcal{H}$-LLM* which uses large language models to perform self-diagnosis by reasoning about the structure underlying the DGP, and self-adaptation by proposing and evaluating corrective actions. Empirically, we analyze different components of *$\mathcal{H}$-LLM* to understand *why* and *when* it works, demonstrating the potential of self-healing ML."
Poster,Self-Labeling the Job Shop Scheduling Problem,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94456,"Andrea Corsini, Angelo Porrello, SIMONE CALDERARA, Mauro Dell&#x27;Amico","This work proposes a self-supervised training strategy designed for combinatorial problems. An obstacle in applying supervised paradigms to such problems is the need for costly target solutions often produced with exact solvers. Inspired by semi- and self-supervised learning, we show that generative models can be trained by sampling multiple solutions and using the best one according to the problem objective as a pseudo-label. In this way, we iteratively improve the model generation capability by relying only on its self-supervision, eliminating the need for optimality information. We validate this Self-Labeling Improvement Method (SLIM) on the Job Shop Scheduling (JSP), a complex combinatorial problem that is receiving much attention from the neural combinatorial community. We propose a generative model based on the well-known Pointer Network and train it with SLIM. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the potential of this approach as the resulting models outperform constructive heuristics and state-of-the-art learning proposals for the JSP. Lastly, we prove the robustness of SLIM to various parameters and its generality by applying it to the Traveling Salesman Problem."
Poster,Self-Play Fine-tuning of Diffusion Models for Text-to-image Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93517,"Huizhuo Yuan, Zixiang Chen, Kaixuan Ji, Quanquan Gu","Fine-tuning Diffusion Models remains an underexplored frontier in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially when compared with the remarkable progress made in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). While cutting-edge diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion (SD) and SDXL rely on supervised fine-tuning, their performance inevitably plateaus after seeing a certain volume of data. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been employed to fine-tune diffusion models with human preference data, but it requires at least two images (``winner'' and ``loser'' images) for each text prompt.In this paper, we introduce an innovative technique called self-play fine-tuning for diffusion models (SPIN-Diffusion), where the diffusion model engages in competition with its earlier versions, facilitating an iterative self-improvement process. Our approach offers an alternative to conventional supervised fine-tuning and RL strategies, significantly improving both model performance and alignment. Our experiments on the Pick-a-Pic dataset reveal that SPIN-Diffusion outperforms the existing supervised fine-tuning method in aspects of human preference alignment and visual appeal right from its first iteration. By the second iteration, it exceeds the performance of RLHF-based methods across all metrics, achieving these results with less data. Codes are available at \url{https://github.com/uclaml/SPIN-Diffusion/}."
