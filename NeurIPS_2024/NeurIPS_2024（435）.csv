Poster,UQ-Guided Hyperparameter Optimization for Iterative Learners,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93913,"Jiesong Liu, Feng Zhang, Jiawei Guan, Xipeng Shen","Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) plays a pivotal role in unleashing the potential of iterative machine learning models. This paper addresses a crucial aspect that has largely been overlooked in HPO: the impact of uncertainty in ML model training. The paper introduces the concept of uncertainty-aware HPO and presents a novel approach called the UQ-guided scheme for quantifying uncertainty. This scheme offers a principled and versatile method to empower HPO techniques in handling model uncertainty during their exploration of the candidate space.By constructing a probabilistic model and implementing probability-driven candidate selection and budget allocation, this approach enhances the quality of the resulting model hyperparameters. It achieves a notable performance improvement of over 50\% in terms of accuracy regret and exploration time."
Poster,UrbanDataLayer: A Unified Data Pipeline for Urban Science,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97837,"Yiheng Wang, Tianyu Wang, YuYing Zhang, Hongji Zhang, Haoyu Zheng, Guanjie Zheng, Linghe Kong","The rapid progression of urbanization has generated a diverse array of urban data, facilitating significant advancements in urban science and urban computing. Current studies often work on separate problems case by case using diverse data, e.g., air quality prediction, and built-up areas classification. This fragmented approach hinders the urban research field from advancing at the pace observed in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, due to two primary reasons. On the one hand, the diverse data processing steps lead to the lack of large-scale benchmarks and therefore decelerate iterative methodology improvement on a single problem. On the other hand, the disparity in multi-modal data formats hinders the combination of the related modal data to stimulate more research findings. To address these challenges, we propose UrbanDataLayer (UDL), a suite of standardized data structures and pipelines for city data engineering, providing a unified data format for researchers. This allows researchers to easily build up large-scale benchmarks and combine multi-modal data, thus expediting the development of multi-modal urban foundation models. To verify the effectiveness of our work, we present four distinct urban problem tasks utilizing the proposed data layer. UrbanDataLayer aims to enhance standardization and operational efficiency within the urban science research community.

Poster,UrbanKGent: A Unified Large Language Model Agent Framework for Urban Knowledge Graph Construction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95400,"Yansong Ning, Hao Liu","Urban knowledge graph has recently worked as an emerging building block to distill critical knowledge from multi-sourced urban data for diverse urban application scenarios. Despite its promising benefits, urban knowledge graph construction (UrbanKGC) still heavily relies on manual effort, hindering its potential advancement. This paper presents UrbanKGent, a unified large language model agent framework, for urban knowledge graph construction. Specifically, we first construct the knowledgeable instruction set for UrbanKGC tasks (such as relational triplet extraction and knowledge graph completion) via heterogeneity-aware and geospatial-infused instruction generation. Moreover, we propose a tool-augmented iterative trajectory refinement module to enhance and refine the trajectories distilled from GPT-4. Through hybrid instruction fine-tuning with augmented trajectories on Llama 2 and Llama 3 family, we obtain UrbanKGC agent family, consisting of UrbanKGent-7/8/13B version. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on two real-world datasets using both human and GPT-4 self-evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate that UrbanKGent family can not only significantly outperform 31 baselines in UrbanKGC tasks, but also surpass the state-of-the-art LLM, GPT-4, by more than 10% with approximately 20 times lower cost. Compared with the existing benchmark, the UrbanKGent family could help construct an UrbanKG with hundreds of times richer relationships using only one-fifth of the data. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/UrbanKGent."
Poster,"USCILab3D: A Large-scale, Long-term, Semantically Annotated Outdoor Dataset",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97517,"Kiran Lekkala, Henghui Bao, Peixu Cai, Wei Lim, Chen Liu, Laurent Itti","In this paper, we introduce the \textbf{USCILab3D dataset}, a large-scale, annotated outdoor dataset designed for versatile applications across multiple domains, including computer vision, robotics, and machine learning. The dataset was acquired using a mobile robot equipped with 5 cameras and a 32-beam, $360^{\circ}$ scanning LIDAR. The robot was teleoperated, over the course of a year and under a variety of weather and lighting conditions, through a rich variety of paths within the USC campus (229 acres = $\sim 92.7$ hectares). The raw data was annotated using state-of-the-art large foundation models, and processed to provide multi-view imagery, 3D reconstructions, semantically-annotated images and point clouds (267 semantic categories), and text descriptions of images and objects within. The dataset also offers a diverse array of complex analyses using pose-stamping and trajectory data. In sum, the dataset offers 1.4M point clouds and 10M images ($\sim 6$TB of data). Despite covering a narrower geographical scope compared to a whole-city dataset, our dataset prioritizes intricate intersections along with denser multi-view scene images and semantic point clouds, enabling more precise 3D labelling and facilitating a broader spectrum of 3D vision tasks.

Poster,User-Creator Feature Polarization in Recommender Systems with Dual Influence,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93010,"Tao Lin, Kun Jin, Andrew Estornell, Xiaoying Zhang, Yiling Chen, Yang Liu","Recommender systems serve the dual purpose of presenting relevant content to users and helping content creators reach their target audience. The dual nature of these systems naturally influences both users and creators: users' preferences are affected by the items they are recommended, while creators may be incentivized to alter their content to attract more users. We define a model, called user-creator feature dynamics, to capture the dual influence of recommender systems. We prove that a recommender system with dual influence is guaranteed to polarize, causing diversity loss in the system. We then investigate, both theoretically and empirically, approaches for mitigating polarization and promoting diversity in recommender systems. Unexpectedly, we find that common diversity-promoting approaches do not work in the presence of dual influence, while relevancy-optimizing methods like top-$k$ truncation can prevent polarization and improve diversity of the system."
Poster,User-item fairness tradeoffs in recommendations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94638,"Sophie Greenwood, Sudalakshmee Chiniah, Nikhil Garg","In the basic recommendation paradigm, the most (predicted) relevant item is recommended to each user. This may result in some items receiving lower exposure than they ""should""; to counter this, several algorithmic approaches have been developed to ensure *item fairness*. These approaches necessarily degrade recommendations for some users to improve outcomes for items, leading to *user fairness* concerns. In turn, a recent line of work has focused on developing algorithms for multi-sided fairness, to jointly optimize user fairness, item fairness, and overall recommendation quality. This induces the question: *what is the tradeoff between these objectives, and what are the characteristics of (multi-objective) optimal solutions?* Theoretically, we develop a model of recommendations with user and item fairness objectives and characterize the solutions of fairness-constrained optimization. We identify two phenomena: (a) when user preferences are diverse, there is ""free"" item and user fairness; and (b) users whose preferences are misestimated can be *especially* disadvantaged by item fairness constraints. Empirically, we prototype a recommendation system for preprints on arXiv and implement our framework, measuring the phenomena in practice and showing how these phenomena inform the *design* of markets with recommendation systems-intermediated matching."
Poster,Using Noise to Infer Aspects of Simplicity Without Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94517,"Zachery Boner, Harry Chen, Lesia Semenova, Ronald Parr, Cynthia Rudin","Noise in data significantly influences decision-making in the data science process. In fact, it has been shown that noise in data generation processes leads practitioners to find simpler models. However, an open question still remains: what is the degree of model simplification we can expect under different noise levels? In this work, we address this question by investigating the relationship between the amount of noise and model simplicity across various hypothesis spaces, focusing on decision trees and linear models. We formally show that noise acts as an implicit regularizer for several different noise models. Furthermore, we prove that Rashomon sets (sets of near-optimal models) constructed with noisy data tend to contain simpler models than corresponding Rashomon sets with non-noisy data. Additionally, we show that noise expands the set of ``good'' features and consequently enlarges the set of models that use at least one good feature. Our work offers theoretical guarantees and practical insights for practitioners and policymakers on whether simple-yet-accurate machine learning models are likely to exist, based on knowledge of noise levels in the data generation process."
Poster,Using Surrogates in Covariate-adjusted Response-adaptive Randomization Experiments with Delayed Outcomes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95978,"Lei Shi, Waverly Wei, Jingshen Wang","Covariate-adjusted response-adaptive randomization (CARA) designs are gaining increasing attention. These designs combine the advantages of randomized experiments with the ability to adaptively revise treatment allocations based on data collected across multiple stages, enhancing estimation efficiency. Yet, CARA designs often assume that primary outcomes are immediately observable, which is not the case in many clinical scenarios where there is a delay in observing primary outcomes. This assumption can lead to significant missingness and inefficient estimation of treatment effects. To tackle this practical challenge, we propose a CARA experimental strategy integrating delayed primary outcomes with immediately observed surrogate outcomes. Surrogate outcomes are intermediate clinical outcomes that are predictive or correlated with the primary outcome of interest. Our design goal is to improve the estimation efficiency of the average treatment effect (ATE) of the primary outcome utilizing surrogate outcomes. From a methodological perspective, our approach offers two benefits: First, we accommodate arm and covariates-dependent delay mechanisms without imposing any parametric modeling assumptions on the distribution of outcomes. Second, when primary outcomes are not fully observed, surrogate outcomes can guide the adaptive treatment allocation rule. From a theoretical standpoint, we prove the semiparametric efficiency bound of estimating ATE under delayed primary outcomes while incorporating surrogate outcomes. We show that the ATE estimator under our proposed design strategy attains this semiparametric efficiency bound and achieves asymptotic normality. Through theoretical investigations and a synthetic HIV study, we show that our design is more efficient than the design without incorporating any surrogate information."
Poster,Using Time-Aware Graph Neural Networks to Predict Temporal Centralities in Dynamic Graphs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96499,"Franziska Heeg, Ingo Scholtes","Node centralities play a pivotal role in network science, social network analysis, and recommender systems.In temporal data, static path-based centralities like closeness or betweenness can give misleading results about the true importance of nodes in a temporal graph. To address this issue, temporal generalizations of betweenness and closeness have been defined that are based on the shortest time-respecting paths between pairs of nodes. However, a major issue of those generalizations is that the calculation of such paths is computationally expensive.Addressing this issue, we study the application of De Bruijn Graph Neural Networks (DBGNN), a time-aware graph neural network architecture, to predict temporal path-based centralities in time series data. We experimentally evaluate our approach in 13 temporal graphs from biological and social systems and show that it considerably improves the prediction of betweenness and closeness centrality compared to (i) a static Graph Convolutional Neural Network, (ii) an efficient sampling-based approximation technique for temporal betweenness, and (iii) two state-of-the-art time-aware graph learning techniques for dynamic graphs."
Poster,Using Unity to Help Solve Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97723,"Connor Brennan, Andrew Williams, Omar G. Younis, Vedant Vyas, Daria Yasafova, Irina Rish","Leveraging the depth and flexibility of XLand as well as the rapid prototyping features of the Unity engine, we present the United Unity Universe — an open-source toolkit designed to accelerate the creation of innovative reinforcement learning environments. This toolkit includes a robust implementation of XLand 2.0 complemented by a user-friendly interface which allows users to modify the details of procedurally generated terrains and task rules with ease. Additionally, we provide a curated selection of terrains and rule sets, accompanied by implementations of reinforcement learning baselines to facilitate quick experimentation with novel architectural designs for adaptive agents. Furthermore, we illustrate how the United Unity Universe serves as a high-level language that enables researchers to develop diverse and endlessly variable 3D environments within a unified framework. This functionality establishes the United Unity Universe (U3) as an essential tool for advancing the field of reinforcement learning, especially in the development of adaptive and generalizable learning systems."
