Poster,Rethinking Fourier Transform from A Basis Functions Perspective for Long-term Time Series Forecasting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96209,"Runze Yang, Longbing Cao, JIE YANG, li jianxun","The interaction between Fourier transform and deep learning opens new avenues for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF). We propose a new perspective to reconsider the Fourier transform from a basis functions perspective. Specifically, the real and imaginary parts of the frequency components can be viewed as the coefficients of cosine and sine basis functions at tiered frequency levels, respectively. We argue existing Fourier-based methods do not involve basis functions thus fail to interpret frequency coefficients precisely and consider the time-frequency relationship sufficiently, leading to inconsistent starting cycles and inconsistent series length issues. Accordingly, a novel Fourier basis mapping (FBM) method addresses these issues by mixing time and frequency domain features through Fourier basis expansion. Differing from existing approaches, FBM (i) embeds the discrete Fourier transform with basis functions, and then (ii) can enable plug-and-play in various types of neural networks for better performance. FBM extracts explicit frequency features while preserving temporal characteristics, enabling the mapping network to capture the time-frequency relationships. By incorporating our unique time-frequency features, the FBM variants can enhance any type of networks like linear, multilayer-perceptron-based, transformer-based, and Fourier-based networks, achieving state-of-the-art LTSF results on diverse real-world datasets with just one or three fully connected layers.

Poster,"Rethinking Human Evaluation Protocol for Text-to-Video Models: Enhancing Reliability, Reproducibility, and Practicality",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96946,"Tianle Zhang, Langtian Ma, Yuchen Yan, yuchen zhang, yue yang, Ziyao Guo, Wenqi Shao, Kai Wang, Yang You, Yu Qiao, Ping Luo, Kaipeng Zhang","Recent text-to-video (T2V) technology advancements, as demonstrated by models such as Gen2, Pika, and Sora, have significantly broadened its applicability and popularity. Despite these strides, evaluating these models poses substantial challenges. Primarily, due to the limitations inherent in automatic metrics, manual evaluation is often considered a superior method for assessing T2V generation. However, existing manual evaluation protocols face reproducibility, reliability, and practicality issues.To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Text-to-Video Human Evaluation (T2VHE) protocol, a comprehensive and standardized protocol for T2V models. The T2VHE protocol includes well-defined metrics, thorough annotator training, and an effective dynamic evaluation module. Experimental results demonstrate that this protocol not only ensures high-quality annotations but can also reduce evaluation costs by nearly 50\%.We will open-source the entire setup of the T2VHE protocol, including the complete protocol workflow, the dynamic evaluation component details, and the annotation interface code. This will help communities establish more sophisticated human assessment protocols."
Poster,Rethinking Imbalance in Image Super-Resolution for Efficient Inference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94175,"Wei Yu, Bowen Yang, Liu Qinglin, Jianing Li, Shengping Zhang, Xiangyang Ji","Existing super-resolution (SR) methods optimize all model weights equally using $\mathcal{L}_1$ or $\mathcal{L}_2$ losses by uniformly sampling image patches without considering dataset imbalances or parameter redundancy, which limits their performance. To address this, we formulate the image SR task as an imbalanced distribution transfer learning problem from a statistical probability perspective, proposing a plug-and-play Weight-Balancing framework (WBSR) to achieve balanced model learning without changing the original model structure and training data. Specifically, we develop a Hierarchical Equalization Sampling (HES) strategy to address data distribution imbalances, enabling better feature representation from texture-rich samples. To tackle model optimization imbalances, we propose a Balanced Diversity Loss (BDLoss) function, focusing on learning texture regions while disregarding redundant computations in smooth regions. After joint training of HES and BDLoss to rectify these imbalances, we present a gradient projection dynamic inference strategy to facilitate accurate and efficient inference. Extensive experiments across various models, datasets, and scale factors demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or superior performance to existing approaches with about 34\% reduction in computational cost."
Poster,Rethinking Inverse Reinforcement Learning: from Data Alignment to Task Alignment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94918,"Weichao Zhou, Wenchao Li","Many imitation learning (IL) algorithms use inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to infer a reward function that aligns with the demonstration.However, the inferred reward functions often fail to capture the underlying task objectives.In this paper, we propose a novel framework for IRL-based IL that prioritizes task alignment over conventional data alignment. Our framework is a semi-supervised approach that leverages expert demonstrations as weak supervision to derive a set of candidate reward functions that align with the task rather than only with the data. It then adopts an adversarial mechanism to train a policy with this set of reward functions to gain a collective validation of the policy's ability to accomplish the task. We provide theoretical insights into this framework's ability to mitigate task-reward misalignment and present a practical implementation. Our experimental results show that our framework outperforms conventional IL baselines in complex and transfer learning scenarios."
Poster,Rethinking LLM Memorization through the Lens of Adversarial Compression,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95676,"Avi Schwarzschild, Zhili Feng, Pratyush Maini, Zachary Lipton, J. Zico Kolter","Large language models (LLMs) trained on web-scale datasets raise substantial concerns regarding permissible data usage. One major question is whether these models ""memorize"" all their training data or they integrate many data sources in some way more akin to how a human would learn and synthesize information. The answer hinges, to a large degree, on \emph{how we define memorization.} In this work, we propose the Adversarial Compression Ratio (ACR) as a metric for assessing memorization in LLMs. A given string from the training data is considered memorized if it can be elicited by a prompt (much) shorter than the string itself---in other words, if these strings can be ``compressed'' with the model by computing adversarial prompts of fewer tokens. The ACR overcomes the limitations of existing notions of memorization by (i) offering an adversarial view of measuring memorization, especially for monitoring unlearning and compliance; and (ii) allowing for the flexibility to measure memorization for arbitrary strings at a reasonably low compute. Our definition serves as a practical tool for determining when model owners may be violating terms around data usage, providing a potential legal tool and a critical lens through which to address such scenarios."
Poster,Rethinking Memory and Communication Costs for Efficient Data Parallel Training of Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96664,"Hanxiao Zhang, Lin JU, Chan Wu, Jinjing Huang, Youshao Xiao, Zhenglei Zhou, Zhiming fan, Zhaoxin Huan, Siyuan Li, Fanzhuang Meng, Lei Liang, Xiaolu Zhang, Jun Zhou","Recently, various strategies for distributed training of large language models (LLMs) have been proposed.By categorizing them into basic strategies and composite strategies, we have discovered that existing basic strategies provide limited options in specific scenarios, leaving considerable room for optimization in training speed.In this paper, we rethink the impact of memory and communication costs on the training speed of LLMs, taking into account the impact of intra- and inter-group communication performance disparities, and then propose a new set of basic strategies named the \textbf{Pa}rtial \textbf{R}edundancy \textbf{O}ptimizer (PaRO).PaRO Data Parallelism (PaRO-DP) accelerates LLM training through refined model state partitioning and tailored training procedures. At the same time, PaRO Collective Communications (PaRO-CC) speeds up collective communication operations by rearranging the topology. We also propose a guideline for choosing different DP strategies based on simple quantitative calculations, which yields minimal ranking errors.Our experiments demonstrate that PaRO improves the training speed of LLMs by up to 266\% that of ZeRO-3 as basic DP strategies.Moreover, employing PaRO-CC independently for model parallel strategies, such as Megatron, can also boost the training speed by 17\%."
Poster,Rethinking Misalignment in Vision-Language Model Adaptation from a Causal Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93182,"Yanan Zhang, Jiangmeng Li, Lixiang Liu, Wenwen Qiang","Foundational Vision-Language models such as CLIP have exhibited impressive generalization in downstream tasks. However, CLIP suffers from a two-level misalignment issue, i.e., task misalignment and data misalignment, when adapting to specific tasks. Soft prompt tuning has mitigated the task misalignment, yet the data misalignment remains a challenge. To analyze the impacts of the data misalignment, we revisit the pre-training and adaptation processes of CLIP and develop a structural causal model. We discover that while we expect to capture task-relevant information for downstream tasks accurately, the task-irrelevant knowledge impacts the prediction results and hampers the modeling of the true relationships between the images and the predicted classes. As task-irrelevant knowledge is unobservable, we leverage the front-door adjustment and propose Causality-Guided Semantic Decoupling and Classification (CDC) to mitigate the interference of task-irrelevant knowledge. Specifically, we decouple semantics contained in the data of downstream tasks and perform classification based on each semantic. Furthermore, we employ the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory to evaluate the uncertainty of each prediction generated by diverse semantics. Experiments conducted in multiple different settings have consistently demonstrated the effectiveness of CDC."
Poster,"Rethinking Model-based, Policy-based, and Value-based Reinforcement Learning via the Lens of Representation Complexity",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93879,"Guhao Feng, Han Zhong","Reinforcement Learning (RL) encompasses diverse paradigms, including model-based RL, policy-based RL, and value-based RL, each tailored to approximate the model, optimal policy, and optimal value function, respectively. This work investigates the potential hierarchy of representation complexity among these RL paradigms. By utilizing computational complexity measures, including time complexity and circuit complexity, we theoretically unveil a potential representation complexity hierarchy within RL. We find that representing the model emerges as the easiest task, followed by the optimal policy, while representing the optimal value function presents the most intricate challenge. Additionally, we reaffirm this hierarchy from the perspective of the expressiveness of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), which align more closely with practical deep RL and contribute to a completely new perspective in theoretical studying representation complexity in RL. Finally, we conduct deep RL experiments to validate our theoretical findings."
Poster,"Rethinking No-reference Image Exposure Assessment from Holism to Pixel:  Models, Datasets and Benchmarks",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92952,"Shuai He, Shuntian Zheng, Anlong Ming, Banyu Wu, Huadong Ma","The past decade has witnessed an increasing demand for enhancing image quality through exposure, and as a crucial prerequisite in this endeavor, Image Exposure Assessment (IEA) is now being accorded serious attention. However, IEA encounters two persistent challenges that remain unresolved over the long term: the accuracy and generalizability of No-reference IEA are inadequate for practical applications; the scope of IEA is confined to qualitative and quantitative analysis of the entire image or subimage, such as providing only a score to evaluate the exposure level, thereby lacking intuitive and precise fine-grained evaluation for complex exposure conditions.  The objective of this paper is to address the persistent bottleneck challenges from three perspectives: model, dataset, and benchmark.  1) Model-level: we propose a Pixel-level IEA Network (P-IEANet) that utilizes Haar discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to analyze, decompose, and assess exposure from both lightness and structural perspectives, capable of generating pixel-level assessment results under no-reference scenarios. 2) Dataset-level: we elaborately build an exposure-oriented dataset, IEA40K, containing 40K  images, covering 17 typical lighting scenarios, 27 devices, and 50+ scenes, with each image densely annotated by more than 10 experts with pixel-level labels.  3) Benchmark-level: we develop a comprehensive benchmark of 19 methods based on IEA40K. Our P-IEANet not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all metrics but also seamlessly integrates with existing exposure correction and lighting enhancement methods. To our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly emphasizes assessing complex image exposure problems at a pixel level, providing a significant boost to the IEA and exposure-related community. The code and dataset are available in \href{https://github.com/mRobotit/Pixel-level-No-reference-Image-Exposure-Assessment}{\textcolor{red} {here}}."
Poster,Rethinking Optimal Transport in Offline Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94076,"Arip Asadulaev, Rostislav Korst, Aleksandr Korotin, Vage Egiazarian, Andrey Filchenkov, Evgeny Burnaev","We propose a novel algorithm for offline reinforcement learning using optimal transport. Typically, in offline reinforcement learning, the data is provided by various experts and some of them can be sub-optimal. To extract an efficient policy, it is necessary to \emph{stitch} the best behaviors from the dataset. To address this problem, we rethink offline reinforcement learning as an optimal transportation problem. And based on this, we present an algorithm that aims to find a policy that maps states to a \emph{partial} distribution of the best expert actions for each given state. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on continuous control problems from the D4RL suite and demonstrate improvements over existing methods."
