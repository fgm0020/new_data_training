Poster,Probabilistic size-and-shape functional mixed models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94356,"Fangyi Wang, Karthik Bharath, Oksana Chkrebtii, Sebastian Kurtek","The reliable recovery and uncertainty quantification of a fixed effect function $\mu$ in a functional mixed model, for modeling population- and object-level variability in noisily observed functional data, is a notoriously challenging task: variations along the $x$ and $y$ axes are confounded with additive measurement error, and cannot in general be disentangled. The question then as to what properties of $\mu$ may be reliably recovered becomes important. We demonstrate that it is possible to recover the size-and-shape of a square-integrable $\mu$ under a Bayesian functional mixed model. The size-and-shape of $\mu$ is a geometric property invariant to a family of space-time unitary transformations, viewed as rotations of the Hilbert space, that jointly transform the $x$ and $y$ axes. A random object-level unitary transformation then captures size-and-shape preserving deviations of $\mu$ from an individual function, while a random linear term and measurement error capture size-and-shape altering deviations. The model is regularized by appropriate priors on the unitary transformations, posterior summaries of which may then be suitably interpreted as optimal data-driven rotations of a fixed orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space. Our numerical experiments demonstrate utility of the proposed model, and superiority over the current state-of-the-art."
Poster,Probabilistic Weather Forecasting with Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93149,"Joel Oskarsson, Tomas Landelius, Marc Deisenroth, Fredrik Lindsten","In recent years, machine learning has established itself as a powerful tool for high-resolution weather forecasting. While most current machine learning models focus on deterministic forecasts, accurately capturing the uncertainty in the chaotic weather system calls for probabilistic modeling. We propose a probabilistic weather forecasting model called Graph-EFM, combining a flexible latent-variable formulation with the successful graph-based forecasting framework. The use of a hierarchical graph construction allows for efficient sampling of spatially coherent forecasts. Requiring only a single forward pass per time step, Graph-EFM allows for fast generation of arbitrarily large ensembles. We experiment with the model on both global and limited area forecasting. Ensemble forecasts from Graph-EFM achieve equivalent or lower errors than comparable deterministic models, with the added benefit of accurately capturing forecast uncertainty."
Poster,Probablistic Emulation of a Global Climate Model with Spherical DYffusion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95762,"Salva Rühling Cachay, Brian Henn, Oliver Watt-Meyer, Christopher S. Bretherton, Rose Yu","Data-driven deep learning models are transforming global weather forecasting. It is an open question if this success can extend to climate modeling, where the complexity of the data and long inference rollouts pose significant challenges. Here, we present the first conditional generative model that produces accurate and physically consistent global climate ensemble simulations by emulating a coarse version of the United States' primary operational global forecast model, FV3GFS.Our model integrates the dynamics-informed diffusion framework (DYffusion) with the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) architecture, enabling stable 100-year simulations at 6-hourly timesteps while maintaining low computational overhead compared to single-step deterministic baselines.The model achieves near gold-standard performance for climate model emulation, outperforming existing approaches and demonstrating promising ensemble skill.This work represents a significant advance towards efficient, data-driven climate simulations that can enhance our understanding of the climate system and inform adaptation strategies.

Poster,Probing Social Bias in Labor Market Text Generation by ChatGPT: A Masked Language Model Approach,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95525,"Lei Ding, Yang Hu, Nicole Denier, Enze Shi, Junxi Zhang, Qirui Hu, Karen Hughes, Linglong Kong, Bei Jiang","As generative large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT gain widespread adoption in various domains, their potential to propagate and amplify social biases, particularly in high-stakes areas such as the labor market, has become a pressing concern. AI algorithms are not only widely used in the selection of job applicants, individual job seekers may also make use of generative LLMs to help develop their job application materials. Against this backdrop, this research builds on a novel experimental design to examine social biases within ChatGPT-generated job applications in response to real job advertisements. By simulating the process of job application creation, we examine the language patterns and biases that emerge when the model is prompted with diverse job postings. Notably, we present a novel bias evaluation framework based on Masked Language Models to quantitatively assess social bias based on validated inventories of social cues/words, enabling a systematic analysis of the language used. Our findings show that the increasing adoption of generative AI, not only by employers but also increasingly by individual job seekers, can reinforce and exacerbate gender and social inequalities in the labor market through the use of biased and gendered language."
Poster,Probing the Decision Boundaries of In-context Learning in Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95957,"Siyan Zhao, Tung Nguyen, Aditya Grover","In-context learning is an emergent paradigm in large language models (LLMs) that enables them to generalize to new tasks and domains by simply prompting these models with a few exemplars without explicit parameter updates. Many attempts have been made to understand in-context learning in LLMs as a function of model scale, pretraining data, and other factors. In this work, we propose a new mechanism to probe and understand in-context learning from the lens of decision boundaries for in-context binary classification. Decision boundaries are straightforward to visualize and provide important information about the qualitative behavior of the inductive biases of standard classifiers. To our surprise, we find that the decision boundaries learned by current LLMs in simple binary classification tasks are often irregularly non-smooth, regardless of task linearity. This paper investigates the factors influencing these decision boundaries and explores methods to enhance their generalizability. We assess various approaches, including training-free and fine-tuning methods for LLMs, the impact of model architecture, and the effectiveness of active prompting techniques for smoothing decision boundaries in a data-efficient manner. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of in-context learning dynamics and offer practical improvements for enhancing robustness and generalizability of in-context learning."
Poster,ProbTS: Benchmarking Point and Distributional Forecasting across Diverse Prediction Horizons,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97527,"Jiawen Zhang, Xumeng Wen, Zhenwei Zhang, Shun Zheng, Jia Li, Jiang Bian","Delivering precise point and distributional forecasts across a spectrum of prediction horizons represents a significant and enduring challenge in the application of time-series forecasting within various industries.Prior research on developing deep learning models for time-series forecasting has often concentrated on isolated aspects, such as long-term point forecasting or short-term probabilistic estimations. This narrow focus may result in skewed methodological choices and hinder the adaptability of these models to uncharted scenarios.While there is a rising trend in developing universal forecasting models, a thorough understanding of their advantages and drawbacks, especially regarding essential forecasting needs like point and distributional forecasts across short and long horizons, is still lacking.In this paper, we present ProbTS, a benchmark tool designed as a unified platform to evaluate these fundamental forecasting needs and to conduct a rigorous comparative analysis of numerous cutting-edge studies from recent years.We dissect the distinctive data characteristics arising from disparate forecasting requirements and elucidate how these characteristics can skew methodological preferences in typical research trajectories, which often fail to fully accommodate essential forecasting needs.Building on this, we examine the latest models for universal time-series forecasting and discover that our analyses of methodological strengths and weaknesses are also applicable to these universal models.Finally, we outline the limitations inherent in current research and underscore several avenues for future exploration."
Poster,Procedure-Aware Surgical Video-language Pretraining with Hierarchical Knowledge Augmentation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92928,"Kun Yuan, vinkle srivastav, Nassir Navab, Nicolas Padoy","Surgical video-language pretraining (VLP) faces unique challenges due to the knowledge domain gap and the scarcity of multi-modal data. This study aims to bridge the gap by addressing issues regarding textual information loss in surgical lecture videos and the spatial-temporal challenges of surgical VLP. To tackle these issues, we propose a hierarchical knowledge augmentation approach and a novel Procedure-Encoded Surgical Knowledge-Augmented Video-Language Pretraining (PeskaVLP) framework. The proposed knowledge augmentation approach uses large language models (LLM) to refine and enrich surgical concepts, thus providing comprehensive language supervision and reducing the risk of overfitting. The PeskaVLP framework combines language supervision with visual self-supervision, constructing hard negative samples and employing a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) based loss function to effectively comprehend the cross-modal procedural alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple public surgical scene understanding and cross-modal retrieval datasets show that our proposed method significantly improves zero-shot transferring performance and offers a generalist visual repre- sentation for further advancements in surgical scene understanding. The source code will be available at https://github.com/CAMMA-public/PeskaVLP."
Poster,PRODuctive bandits: Importance Weighting No More,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94919,"Julian Zimmert, Teodor Vanislavov Marinov","Prod is a seminal algorithm in full-information online learning, which has been conjectured to be fundamentally sub-optimal for multi-armed bandits.By leveraging the interpretation of Prod as a first-order OMD approximation, we present the following surprising results:1. Variants of Prod can obtain optimal regret for adversarial multi-armed bandits. 2. There exists a simple and (arguably) importance-weighting free variant with optimal rate. 3. One can even achieve best-both-worlds guarantees with logarithmic regret in the stochastic regime.The bandit algorithms in this work use simple arithmetic update rules without the need of solving optimization problems typical in prior work. Finally, the results directly improve the state of the art of incentive-compatible bandits."
Poster,ProEdit: Simple Progression is All You Need for High-Quality 3D Scene Editing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94022,"Junkun Chen, Yu-Xiong Wang","This paper proposes ProEdit - a simple yet effective framework for high-quality 3D scene editing guided by diffusion distillation in a novel progressive manner. Inspired by the crucial observation that multi-view inconsistency in scene editing is rooted in the diffusion model’s large feasible output space (FOS), our framework controls the size of FOS and reduces inconsistency by decomposing the overall editing task into several subtasks, which are then executed progressively on the scene. Within this framework, we design a difficulty-aware subtask decomposition scheduler and an adaptive 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) training strategy, ensuring high efficiency in performing each subtask. Extensive evaluation shows that our ProEdit achieves state-of-the-art results in various scenes and challenging editing tasks, all through a simple framework without any expensive or sophisticated add-ons like distillation losses, components, or training procedures. Notably, ProEdit also provides a new way to preview, control, and select the aggressivity of editing operation during the editing process."
Poster,ProG: A Graph Prompt Learning Benchmark,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97445,"Chenyi Zi, Haihong Zhao, Xiangguo Sun, Yiqing Lin, Hong Cheng, Jia Li","Artificial general intelligence on graphs has shown significant advancements across various applications, yet the traditional `Pre-train \& Fine-tune' paradigm faces inefficiencies and negative transfer issues, particularly in complex and few-shot settings. Graph prompt learning emerges as a promising alternative, leveraging lightweight prompts to manipulate data and fill the task gap by reformulating downstream tasks to the pretext. However, several critical challenges still remain: how to unify diverse graph prompt models, how to evaluate the quality of graph prompts, and to improve their usability for practical comparisons and selection. In response to these challenges, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for graph prompt learning. Our benchmark integrates **SIX** pre-training methods and **FIVE** state-of-the-art graph prompt techniques, evaluated across **FIFTEEN** diverse datasets to assess performance, flexibility, and efficiency. We also present 'ProG', an easy-to-use open-source library that streamlines the execution of various graph prompt models, facilitating objective evaluations. Additionally, we propose a unified framework that categorizes existing graph prompt methods into two main approaches: prompts as graphs and prompts as tokens. This framework enhances the applicability and comparison of graph prompt techniques. The code is available at: https://github.com/sheldonresearch/ProG."
