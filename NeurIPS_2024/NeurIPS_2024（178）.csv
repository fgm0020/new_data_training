Poster,Grokking of Implicit Reasoning in Transformers: A Mechanistic Journey to the Edge of Generalization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96105,"Boshi Wang, Xiang Yue, Yu Su, Huan Sun","We study whether transformers can learn to *implicitly* reason over parametric knowledge, a skill that even the most capable language models struggle with. Focusing on two representative reasoning types, composition and comparison, we consistently find that transformers *can* learn implicit reasoning, but only through *grokking*, i.e., extended training far beyond overfitting. The levels of generalization also vary across reasoning types: when faced with out-of-distribution examples, transformers fail to systematically generalize for composition but succeed for comparison. We delve into the model's internals throughout training, conducting analytical experiments that reveal: 1) the mechanism behind grokking, such as the formation of the generalizing circuit and its relation to the relative efficiency of generalizing and memorizing circuits, and 2) the connection between systematicity and the configuration of the generalizing circuit. Our findings guide data and training setup to better induce implicit reasoning and suggest potential improvements to the transformer architecture, such as encouraging cross-layer knowledge sharing. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for a challenging reasoning task with a large search space, GPT-4-Turbo and Gemini-1.5-Pro based on non-parametric memory fail badly regardless of prompting styles or retrieval augmentation, while a fully grokked transformer can achieve near-perfect accuracy, showcasing the power of parametric memory for complex reasoning."
Poster,Grounded Answers for Multi-agent Decision-making Problem through Generative World Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95231,"Zeyang Liu, Xinrui Yang, Shiguang Sun, Long Qian, Lipeng Wan, Xingyu Chen, Xuguang Lan","Recent progress in generative models has stimulated significant innovations in many fields, such as image generation and chatbots. Despite their success, these models often produce sketchy and misleading solutions for complex multi-agent decision-making problems because they miss the trial-and-error experience and reasoning as humans. To address this limitation, we explore a paradigm that integrates a language-guided simulator into the multi-agent reinforcement learning pipeline to enhance the generated answer. The simulator is a world model that separately learns dynamics and reward, where the dynamics model comprises an image tokenizer as well as a causal transformer to generate interaction transitions autoregressively, and the reward model is a bidirectional transformer learned by maximizing the likelihood of trajectories in the expert demonstrations under language guidance. Given an image of the current state and the task description, we use the world model to train the joint policy and produce the image sequence as the answer by running the converged policy on the dynamics model. The empirical results demonstrate that this framework can improve the answers for multi-agent decision-making problems by showing superior performance on the training and unseen tasks of the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge benchmark. In particular, it can generate consistent interaction sequences and explainable reward functions at interaction states, opening the path for training generative models of the future."
Poster,Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models in Actions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96941,"Andrew Szot, Bogdan Mazoure, Harsh Agrawal, R Devon Hjelm, Zsolt Kira, Alexander Toshev","Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated a wide range of capabilities across many domains including Embodied AI. In this work, we study how to best ground a MLLM into different embodiments and their associated action spaces, including both continuous and discrete actions. For continuous actions, a set of learned tokenizations that capture an action at various resolutions allows for sufficient modeling precision, yielding the best performance on downstream tasks. For discrete actions, semantically aligning these actions with the native output token space of the MLLM leads to the strongest performance. We arrive at these lessons via a thorough study of seven action grounding approaches on five different environments, encompassing over 114 embodied tasks."
Poster,GrounDiT: Grounding Diffusion Transformers via Noisy Patch Transplantation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95097,"Yuseung Lee, Taehoon Yoon, Minhyuk Sung","We introduce GrounDiT, a novel training-free spatial grounding technique for text-to-image generation using Diffusion Transformers (DiT). Spatial grounding with bounding boxes has gained attention for its simplicity and versatility, allowing for enhanced user control in image generation. However, prior training-free approaches often rely on updating the noisy image during the reverse diffusion process via backpropagation from custom loss functions, which frequently struggle to provide precise control over individual bounding boxes. In this work, we leverage the flexibility of the Transformer architecture, demonstrating that DiT can generate noisy patches corresponding to each bounding box, fully encoding the target object and allowing for fine-grained control over each region. Our approach builds on an intriguing property of DiT, which we refer to as semantic sharing. Due to semantic sharing, when a smaller patch is jointly denoised alongside a generatable-size image, the two become semantic clones. Each patch is denoised in its own branch of the generation process and then transplanted into the corresponding region of the original noisy image at each timestep, resulting in robust spatial grounding for each bounding box. In our experiments on the HRS and DrawBench benchmarks, we achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to previous training-free approaches. Project Page: https://groundit-diffusion.github.io/."
Poster,Group and Shuffle: Efficient Structured Orthogonal Parametrization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96471,"Mikhail Gorbunov, Nikolay Yudin, Vera Soboleva, Aibek Alanov, Alexey Naumov, Maxim Rakhuba","The increasing size of neural networks has led to a growing demand for methods of efficient finetuning. Recently, an orthogonal finetuning paradigm was introduced that uses orthogonal matrices for adapting the weights of a pretrained model. In this paper, we introduce a new class of structured matrices, which unifies and generalizes structured classes from previous works. We examine properties of this class and build a structured orthogonal parametrization upon it.  We then use this parametrization to modify the orthogonal finetuning framework, improving parameter efficiency. We empirically validate our method on different domains, including adapting of text-to-image diffusion models and downstream task finetuning in language modeling. Additionally, we adapt our construction for orthogonal convolutions and conduct experiments with 1-Lipschitz neural networks."
Poster,Group Robust Preference Optimization in Reward-free RLHF,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95314,"Shyam Sundhar Ramesh, Yifan Hu, Iason Chaimalas, Viraj Mehta, Pier Giuseppe Sessa, Haitham Bou Ammar, Ilija Bogunovic","Adapting large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks usually involves fine-tuning through reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) on preference data. While these data often come from diverse labelers' groups (e.g., different demographics, ethnicities, company teams, etc.), traditional RLHF approaches adopt a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach, i.e., they indiscriminately assume and optimize a single preference model, thus not being robust to unique characteristics and needs of the various groups. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Group Robust Preference Optimization (GRPO) method to align LLMs to individual groups' preferences robustly. Our approach builds upon reward-free direct preference optimization methods, but unlike previous approaches, it seeks a robust policy which maximizes the worst-case group performance.  To achieve this, GRPO adaptively and sequentially weights the importance of different groups, prioritizing groups with worse cumulative loss. We theoretically study the feasibility of GRPO and analyze its convergence for the log-linear policy class. By fine-tuning LLMs with GRPO using diverse group-based global opinion data, we significantly improved performance for the worst-performing groups, reduced loss imbalances across groups, and improved probability accuracies compared to non-robust baselines."
Poster,Group-wise oracle-efficient algorithms for online multi-group learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93868,"Samuel Deng, Jingwen Liu, Daniel Hsu","We study the problem of online multi-group learning, a learning model in which an online learner must simultaneously achieve small prediction regret on a large collection of (possibly overlapping) subsequences corresponding to a family of groups. Groups are subsets of the context space, and in fairness applications, they may correspond to subpopulations defined by expressive functions of demographic attributes. In this paper, we design such oracle-efficient algorithms with sublinear regret under a variety of settings, including: (i) the i.i.d. setting, (ii) the adversarial setting with smoothed context distributions, and (iii) the adversarial transductive setting."
Poster,GS-Blur: A 3D Scene-Based Dataset for Realistic Image Deblurring,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97820,"Dongwoo Lee, JoonKyu Park, Kyoung Mu Lee","To train a deblurring network, an appropriate dataset with paired blurry and sharp images is essential.Existing datasets collect blurry images either synthetically by aggregating consecutive sharp frames or using sophisticated camera systems to capture real blur.However, these methods offer limited diversity in blur types (blur trajectories) or require extensive human effort to reconstruct large-scale datasets, failing to fully reflect real-world blur scenarios.To address this, we propose GS-Blur, a dataset of synthesized realistic blurry images created using a novel approach.To this end, we first reconstruct 3D scenes from multi-view images using 3D Gaussian Splatting~(3DGS), then render blurry images by moving the camera view along the randomly generated motion trajectories.By adopting various camera trajectories in reconstructing our GS-Blur, our dataset contains realistic and diverse types of blur, offering a large-scale dataset that generalizes well to real-world blur.Using GS-Blur with various deblurring methods, we demonstrate its ability to generalize effectively compared to previous synthetic or real blur datasets, showing significant improvements in deblurring performance.We will publicly release our dataset."
Poster,GSDF: 3DGS Meets SDF for Improved Neural Rendering and Reconstruction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93457,"Mulin Yu, Tao Lu, Linning Xu, Lihan Jiang, Yuanbo Xiangli, Bo Dai","Representing 3D scenes from multiview images remains a core challenge in computer vision and graphics, requiring both reliable rendering and reconstruction, which often conflicts due to the mismatched prioritization of image quality over precise underlying scene geometry. Although both neural implicit surfaces and explicit Gaussian primitives have advanced with neural rendering techniques, current methods impose strict constraints on density fields or primitive shapes, which enhances the affinity for geometric reconstruction at the sacrifice of rendering quality. To address this dilemma, we introduce GSDF, a dual-branch architecture combining 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and neural Signed Distance Fields (SDF). Our approach leverages mutual guidance and joint supervision during the training process to mutually enhance reconstruction and rendering. Specifically, our method guides the Gaussian primitives to locate near potential surfaces and accelerates the SDF convergence. This implicit mutual guidance ensures robustness and accuracy in both synthetic and real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method boosts the SDF optimization process to reconstruct more detailed geometry, while reducing floaters and blurry edge artifacts in rendering by aligning Gaussian primitives with the underlying geometry."
Poster,GSGAN: Adversarial Learning for Hierarchical Generation of 3D Gaussian Splats,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93398,"Sangeek Hyun, Jae-Pil Heo","Most advances in 3D Generative Adversarial Networks (3D GANs) largely depend on ray casting-based volume rendering, which incurs demanding rendering costs. One promising alternative is rasterization-based 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), providing a much faster rendering speed and explicit 3D representation. In this paper, we exploit Gaussian as a 3D representation for 3D GANs by leveraging its efficient and explicit characteristics. However, in an adversarial framework, we observe that a na\""ive generator architecture suffers from training instability and lacks the capability to adjust the scale of Gaussians. This leads to model divergence and visual artifacts due to the absence of proper guidance for initialized positions of Gaussians and densification to manage their scales adaptively. To address these issues, we introduce GSGAN, a generator architecture with a hierarchical multi-scale Gaussian representation that effectively regularizes the position and scale of generated Gaussians. Specifically, we design a hierarchy of Gaussians where finer-level Gaussians are parameterized by their coarser-level counterparts; the position of finer-level Gaussians would be located near their coarser-level counterparts, and the scale would monotonically decrease as the level becomes finer, modeling both coarse and fine details of the 3D scene. Experimental results demonstrate that ours achieves a significantly faster rendering speed (×100) compared to state-of-the-art 3D consistent GANs with comparable 3D generation capability."
