Poster,Piecewise-Stationary Bandits with Knapsacks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94054,"Xilin Zhang, Wang Chi Cheung","We study Bandits with Knapsacks (Bwk) in a piecewise-stationary environment. We propose a novel inventory reserving algorithm which draws new insights into the problem. Suppose parameters $\eta_{\min}, \eta_{\max} \in (0,1]$ respectively lower and upper bound the reward earned and the resources consumed in a time round. Our algorithm achieves a provably near-optimal competitive ratio of $O(\log(\eta_{\max}/\eta_{\min}))$, with a matching lower bound provided. Our performance guarantee is based on a dynamic benchmark, distinguishing our work from existing works on adversarial Bwk who compare with the static benchmark. Furthermore, different from existing non-stationary Bwk work, we do not require a bounded global variation."
Poster,PINNacle: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving PDEs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97621,"Hao Zhongkai, Jiachen Yao, Chang Su, Hang Su, Ziao Wang, Fanzhi Lu, Zeyu Xia, Yichi Zhang, Songming Liu, Lu Lu, Jun Zhu","While significant progress has been made on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a comprehensive comparison of these methods across a wide range of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is still lacking. This study introduces PINNacle, a benchmarking tool designed to fill this gap. PINNacle provides a diverse dataset, comprising over 20 distinct PDEs from various domains, including heat conduction, fluid dynamics, biology, and electromagnetics. These PDEs encapsulate key challenges inherent to real-world problems, such as complex geometry, multi-scale phenomena, nonlinearity, and high dimensionality. PINNacle also offers a user-friendly toolbox, incorporating about 10 state-of-the-art PINN methods for systematic evaluation and comparison. We have conducted extensive experiments with these methods, offering insights into their strengths and weaknesses. In addition to providing a standardized means of assessing performance, PINNacle also offers an in-depth analysis to guide future research, particularly in areas such as domain decomposition methods and loss reweighting for handling multi-scale problems and complex geometry.  To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest benchmark with a diverse and comprehensive evaluation that will undoubtedly foster further research in PINNs."
Poster,Pin-Tuning: Parameter-Efficient In-Context Tuning for Few-Shot Molecular Property Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96395,"Liang Wang, Qiang Liu, Shaozhen Liu, Xin Sun, Shu Wu, Liang Wang","Molecular property prediction (MPP) is integral to drug discovery and material science, but often faces the challenge of data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Addressing this, few-shot molecular property prediction (FSMPP) has been developed. Unlike other few-shot tasks, FSMPP typically employs a pre-trained molecular encoder and a context-aware classifier, benefiting from molecular pre-training and molecular context information. Despite these advancements, existing methods struggle with the ineffective fine-tuning of pre-trained encoders. We attribute this issue to the imbalance between the abundance of tunable parameters and the scarcity of labeled molecules, and the lack of contextual perceptiveness in the encoders. To overcome this hurdle, we propose a parameter-efficient in-context tuning method, named Pin-Tuning. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter for pre-trained message passing layers (MP-Adapter) and Bayesian weight consolidation for pre-trained atom/bond embedding layers (Emb-BWC), to achieve parameter-efficient tuning while preventing over-fitting and catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, we enhance the MP-Adapters with contextual perceptiveness. This innovation allows for in-context tuning of the pre-trained encoder, thereby improving its adaptability for specific FSMPP tasks. When evaluated on public datasets, our method demonstrates superior tuning with fewer trainable parameters, improving few-shot predictive performance."
Poster,Pipeline Parallelism with Controllable Memory,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94868,"Penghui Qi, Xinyi Wan, Nyamdavaa Amar, Min Lin","Pipeline parallelism has been widely explored, but most existing schedules lack a systematic methodology. In this paper, we propose a framework to decompose pipeline schedules as repeating a building block, and show that the lifespan of the building block decides the peak activation memory of the pipeline schedule. Guided by the observations, we find that almost all existing pipeline schedules, to the best of our knowledge, are memory inefficient. To address this, we introduce a family of memory efficient building blocks with controllable activation memory, which can reduce the peak activation memory to 1/2 of 1F1B without sacrificing efficiency, and even to 1/3 with comparable throughput. We can also achieve almost zero pipeline bubbles while maintaining the same activation memory as 1F1B. Our evaluations demonstrate that in pure pipeline parallelism settings, our methods outperform 1F1B by from 7\% to 55\% in terms of throughput. When employing a grid search over hybrid parallelism hyperparameters in practical scenarios, our methods demonstrate a 16\% throughput improvement over the 1F1B baseline for large language models. The implementation is open-sourced at https://github.com/sail-sg/zero-bubble-pipeline-parallelism."
Poster,PiSSA: Principal Singular Values and Singular Vectors Adaptation of Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96517,"Fanxu Meng, Zhaohui Wang, Muhan Zhang","To parameter-efficiently fine-tune (PEFT) large language models (LLMs), the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) method approximates the model changes $\Delta W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ through the product of two matrices $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r}$ and $B \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times n}$, where $r \ll \min(m, n)$, $A$ is initialized with Gaussian noise, and $B$ with zeros. LoRA **freezes the original model $W$** and **updates the ""Noise \& Zero"" adapter**, which may lead to slow convergence. To overcome this limitation, we introduce **P**r**i**ncipal **S**ingular values and **S**ingular vectors **A**daptation (PiSSA). PiSSA shares the same architecture as LoRA, but initializes the adaptor matrices $A$ and $B$ with the principal components of the original matrix $W$, and put the remaining components into a residual matrix $W^{res} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ which is frozen during fine-tuning.Compared to LoRA, PiSSA **updates the principal components** while **freezing the ""residual"" parts**, allowing faster convergence and enhanced performance. Comparative experiments of PiSSA and LoRA across 11 different models, ranging from 184M to 70B, encompassing 5 NLG and 8 NLU tasks, reveal that PiSSA consistently outperforms LoRA under identical experimental setups. On the GSM8K benchmark, Gemma-7B fine-tuned with PiSSA achieves an accuracy of 77.7\%, surpassing LoRA's 74.53\% by 3.25\%. Due to the same architecture, PiSSA is also compatible with quantization to further reduce the memory requirement of fine-tuning. Compared to QLoRA, QPiSSA (PiSSA with 4-bit quantization) exhibits smaller quantization errors in the initial stages. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3-70B on GSM8K, QPiSSA attains an accuracy of 86.05\%, exceeding the performances of QLoRA at 81.73\%. Leveraging a fast SVD technique, PiSSA can be initialized in only a few seconds, presenting a negligible cost for transitioning from LoRA to PiSSA."
Poster,PIVOT-R: Primitive-Driven Waypoint-Aware World Model for Robotic Manipulation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94118,"Kaidong Zhang, Pengzhen Ren, Bingqian Lin, Junfan Lin, Shikui Ma, Hang Xu, Xiaodan Liang","Language-guided robotic manipulation is a challenging task that requires an embodied agent to follow abstract user instructions to accomplish various complex manipulation tasks. Previous work generally maps instructions and visual perceptions directly to low-level executable actions, neglecting the modeling of critical waypoints (e.g., key states of “close to/grab/move up” in action trajectories) in manipulation tasks.To address this issue, we propose a PImitive-driVen waypOinT-aware world model for Robotic manipulation (PIVOT-R) that focuses solely on the prediction of task-relevant waypoints. Specifically, PIVOT-R consists of a Waypoint-aware World Model (WAWM) and a lightweight action prediction module. The former performs primitive action parsing and primitive-driven waypoint prediction, while the latter focuses on decoding low-level actions. Additionally, we also design an asynchronous hierarchical executor (AHE) for PIVOT-R, which can use different execution frequencies for different modules of the model, thereby helping the model reduce computational redundancy and improve model execution efficiency. Our PIVOT-R outperforms state-of-the-art (SoTA) open-source models on the SeaWave benchmark, achieving an average relative improvement of 19.45% across four levels of instruction tasks. Moreover, compared to the synchronously executed PIVOT-R, the execution efficiency of PIVOT-R with AHE is increased by 28-fold, with only a 2.9% drop in performance. These results provide compelling evidence that our PIVOT-R can significantly improve both the performance and efficiency of robotic manipulation."
Poster,Plan-on-Graph: Self-Correcting Adaptive Planning of Large Language Model on Knowledge Graphs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96115,"Liyi Chen, Panrong Tong, Zhongming Jin, Ying Sun, Jieping Ye, Hui Xiong","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities on complex tasks, but they still suffer from out-of-date knowledge, hallucinations, and opaque decision-making. In contrast, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can provide explicit and editable knowledge for LLMs to alleviate these issues. Existing paradigm of KG-augmented LLM manually predefines the breadth of exploration space and requires flawless navigation in KGs. However, this paradigm cannot adaptively explore reasoning paths in KGs based on the question semantics and self-correct erroneous reasoning paths, resulting in a bottleneck in efficiency and effect. To address these limitations, we propose a novel self-correcting adaptive planning paradigm for KG-augmented LLM named Plan-on-Graph (PoG), which first decomposes the question into several sub-objectives and then repeats the process of adaptively exploring reasoning paths, updating memory, and reflecting on the need to self-correct erroneous reasoning paths until arriving at the answer. Specifically, three important mechanisms of Guidance, Memory, and Reflection are designed to work together, to guarantee the adaptive breadth of self-correcting planning for graph reasoning. Finally, extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of PoG."
Poster,Plant-and-Steal: Truthful Fair Allocations via Predictions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94573,"Ilan Cohen, Alon Eden, Talya Eden, Arsen Vasilyan","We study truthful mechanisms for approximating the Maximin-Share (MMS) allocation of agents with additive valuations for indivisible goods. Algorithmically, constant factor approximations exist for the problem for any number of agents. When adding incentives to the mix, a jarring result by Amanatidis, Birmpas, Christodoulou, and  Markakis [EC 2017] shows that the best possible approximation for two agents and $m$ items is $\lfloor \frac{m}{2} \rfloor$. We adopt a learning-augmented framework to investigate what is possible when some prediction on the input is given. For two agents, we give a truthful mechanism that takes agents' ordering over items as prediction. When the prediction is accurate, we give a $2$-approximation to the MMS  (consistency), and when the prediction is off, we still get an $\lceil \frac{m}{2} \rceil$-approximation to the MMS (robustness). We further show that the mechanism's performance degrades gracefully in the number of ``mistakes"" in the prediction; i.e., we interpolate (up to constant factors) between the two extremes: when there are no mistakes, and when there is a maximum number of mistakes. We also show an impossibility result on the obtainable consistency for mechanisms with finite robustness. For the general case of $n\ge 2$ agents, we give a 2-approximation mechanism for accurate predictions, with relaxed fallback guarantees. Finally, we give experimental results which illustrate when different components of  our framework, made to insure consistency and robustness, come into play."
Poster,PLIP: Language-Image Pre-training for Person Representation Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94298,"Jialong Zuo, Jiahao Hong, Feng Zhang, Changqian Yu, Hanyu Zhou, Changxin Gao, Nong Sang, Jingdong Wang","Language-image pre-training is an effective technique for learning powerful representations in general domains. However, when directly turning to person representation learning, these general pre-training methods suffer from unsatisfactory performance. The reason is that they neglect critical person-related characteristics, i.e., fine-grained attributes and identities. To address this issue, we propose a novel language-image pre-training framework for person representation learning, termed PLIP. Specifically, we elaborately design three pretext tasks: 1) Text-guided Image Colorization, aims to establish the correspondence between the person-related image regions and the fine-grained color-part textual phrases. 2) Image-guided Attributes Prediction, aims to mine fine-grained attribute information of the person body in the image; and 3) Identity-based Vision-Language Contrast, aims to correlate the cross-modal representations at the identity level rather than the instance level. Moreover, to implement our pre-train framework, we construct a large-scale person dataset with image-text pairs named SYNTH-PEDES by automatically generating textual annotations. We pre-train PLIP on SYNTH-PEDES and evaluate our models by spanning downstream person-centric tasks. PLIP not only significantly improves existing methods on all these tasks, but also shows great ability in the zero-shot and domain generalization settings. The code, dataset and weight will be made publicly available."
Poster,PointAD: Comprehending 3D Anomalies from Points and Pixels for Zero-shot 3D Anomaly Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96958,"Qihang Zhou, Jiangtao Yan, Shibo He, Wenchao Meng, Jiming Chen","Zero-shot (ZS) 3D anomaly detection is a crucial yet unexplored field that addresses scenarios where target 3D training samples are unavailable due to practical concerns like privacy protection. This paper introduces PointAD, a novel approach that transfers the strong generalization capabilities of CLIP for recognizing 3D anomalies on unseen objects. PointAD provides a unified framework to comprehend 3D anomalies from both points and pixels. In this framework, PointAD renders 3D anomalies into multiple 2D renderings and projects them back into 3D space. To capture the generic anomaly semantics into PointAD, we propose hybrid representation learning that optimizes the learnable text prompts from 3D and 2D through auxiliary point clouds. The collaboration optimization between point and pixel representations jointly facilitates our model to grasp underlying 3D anomaly patterns, contributing to detecting and segmenting anomalies of unseen diverse 3D objects. Through the alignment of 3D and 2D space, our model can directly integrate RGB information, further enhancing the understanding of 3D anomalies in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments show the superiority of PointAD in ZS 3D anomaly detection across diverse unseen objects."
