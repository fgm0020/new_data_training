Poster,On-Road Object Importance Estimation: A New Dataset and A Model with Multi-Fold Top-Down Guidance,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93053,"Zhixiong Nan, Yilong Chen, Tianfei Zhou, Tao Xiang","This paper addresses the problem of on-road object importance estimation, which utilizes video sequences captured from the driver's perspective as the input. Although this problem is significant for safer and smarter driving systems, the exploration of this problem remains limited. On one hand, publicly-available large-scale datasets are scarce in the community. To address this dilemma, this paper contributes a new large-scale dataset named Traffic Object Importance (TOI). On the other hand, existing methods often only consider either bottom-up feature or single-fold guidance, leading to limitations in handling highly dynamic and diverse traffic scenarios. Different from existing methods, this paper proposes a model that integrates multi-fold top-down guidance with the bottom-up feature. Specifically, three kinds of top-down guidance factors (i.e., driver intention, semantic context, and traffic rule) are integrated into our model. These factors are important for object importance estimation, but none of the existing methods simultaneously consider them. To our knowledge, this paper proposes the first on-road object importance estimation model that fuses multi-fold top-down guidance factors with bottom-up feature. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins, achieving 23.1% Average Precision (AP) improvement compared with the recently proposed model (i.e., Goal)."
Poster,On Sampling Strategies for Spectral Model Sharding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95292,"Denis Korzhenkov, Christos Louizos","The problem of heterogeneous clients in federated learning has recently drawn a lot of attention. Spectral model sharding, i.e., partitioning the model parameters into low-rank matrices based on the singular value decomposition, has been one of the proposed solutions for more efficient on-device training in such settings. In this work we present two sampling strategies for such sharding, obtained as solutions to specific optimization problems. The first produces unbiased estimators of the original weights, while the second aims to minimize the squared approximation error. We discuss how both of these estimators can be incorporated in the federated learning loop and practical considerations that arise during local training. Empirically, we demonstrate that both of these methods can lead to improved performance in various commonly used datasets."
Poster,On scalable oversight with weak LLMs judging strong LLMs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95397,"Zachary Kenton, Noah Siegel, Janos Kramar, Jonah Brown-Cohen, Samuel Albanie, Jannis Bulian, Rishabh Agarwal, David Lindner, Yunhao Tang, Noah Goodman, Rohin Shah","Scalable oversight protocols aim to enable humans to accurately supervise superhuman AI. In this paper we study debate, where two AI's compete to convince a judge; consultancy, where a single AI tries to convince a judge that asks questions;and compare to a baseline of direct question-answering, where the judge just answers outright without the AI.We use large language models (LLMs) as both AI agents and as stand-ins for human judges, taking the judge models to be weaker than agent models. We benchmark on a diverse range of asymmetries between judges and agents, extending previous work on a single extractive QA task with information asymmetry, to also include mathematics, coding, logic and multimodal reasoning asymmetries. We find that debate outperforms consultancy across all tasks when the consultant is randomly assigned to argue for the correct/incorrect answer. Comparing debate to direct question answering, the results depend on the type of task: in extractive QA tasks with information asymmetry debate outperforms direct question answering, but in other tasks without information asymmetry the results are mixed.Previous work assigned debaters/consultants an answer to argue for. When we allow them to instead choose which answer to argue for, we find judges are less frequently convinced by the wrong answer in debate than in consultancy.Further, we find that stronger debater models increase judge accuracy, though more modestly than in previous studies."
Poster,On Socially Fair Low-Rank Approximation and Column Subset Selection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96034,"Zhao Song, Ali Vakilian, David Woodruff, Samson Zhou","Low-rank approximation and column subset selection are two fundamental and related problems that are applied across a wealth of machine learning applications. In this paper, we study the question of socially fair low-rank approximation and socially fair column subset selection, where the goal is to minimize the loss over all sub-populations of the data. We show that surprisingly, even constant-factor approximation to fair low-rank approximation requires exponential time under certain standard complexity hypotheses. On the positive side, we give an algorithm for fair low-rank approximation that, for a constant number of groups and constant-factor accuracy, runs in $2^{\text{poly}(k)}$ rather than the naive $n^{\text{poly}(k)}$, which is a substantial improvement when the dataset has a large number $n$ of observations. We then show that there exist bicriteria approximation algorithms for fair low-rank approximation and fair column subset selection that runs in polynomial time."
Poster,On Softmax Direct Preference Optimization for Recommendation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93473,"Yuxin Chen, Junfei Tan, An Zhang, Zhengyi Yang, Leheng Sheng, Enzhi Zhang, Xiang Wang, Tat-Seng Chua","Recommender systems aim to predict personalized rankings based on user preference data. With the rise of Language Models (LMs), LM-based recommenders have been widely explored due to their extensive world knowledge and powerful reasoning abilities. Most of the LM-based recommenders convert historical interactions into language prompts, pairing with a positive item as the target response and fine-tuning LM with a language modeling loss. However, the current objective fails to fully leverage preference data and is not optimized for personalized ranking tasks, which hinders the performance of LM-based recommenders. Inspired by the current advancement of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in human preference alignment and the success of softmax loss in recommendations, we propose Softmax-DPO (\textbf{S-DPO}) to instill ranking information into the LM to help LM-based recommenders distinguish preferred items from negatives, rather than solely focusing on positives. Specifically, we incorporate multiple negatives in user preference data and devise an alternative version of DPO loss tailored for LM-based recommenders, which is extended from the traditional full-ranking Plackett-Luce (PL) model to partial rankings and connected to softmax sampling strategies. Theoretically, we bridge S-DPO with the softmax loss over negative sampling and find that it has an inherent benefit of mining hard negatives, which assures its exceptional capabilities in recommendation tasks. Empirically, extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of S-DPO to effectively model user preference and further boost recommendation performance while providing better rewards for preferred items. Our codes are available at https://github.com/chenyuxin1999/S-DPO."
Poster,On Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95509,"Yongchun Li, Santanu Dey, Weijun Xie","The classical Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) identifies the correlations between two sets of multivariate variables based on their covariance, which has been widely applied in diverse fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech analysis. Despite its popularity, CCA can encounter challenges in explaining correlations between two variable sets within high-dimensional data contexts. Thus, this paper studies Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (SCCA) that enhances the interpretability of CCA. We first show that SCCA generalizes three well-known sparse optimization problems, sparse PCA, sparse SVD, and sparse regression, which are all classified as NP-hard problems. This result motivates us to develop strong formulations and efficient algorithms. Our main contributions include (i) the introduction of a combinatorial formulation that captures the essence of SCCA and allows the development of exact and approximation algorithms; (ii) the establishment of the complexity results for two low-rank special cases of SCCA; and (iii) the derivation of an equivalent mixed-integer semidefinite programming model that facilitates a specialized branch-and-cut algorithm with analytical cuts. The effectiveness of our proposed formulations and algorithms is validated through numerical experiments."
Poster,On Statistical Rates and  Provably Efficient Criteria of Latent Diffusion Transformers (DiTs),https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94411,"Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Weimin Wu, Zhuoru Li, Sophia Pi, Zhao Song, Han Liu","We investigate the statistical and computational limits of latent **Di**ffusion **T**ransformers (**DiTs**) under the low-dimensional linear latent space assumption. Statistically, we study the universal approximation and sample complexity of the DiTs score function, as well as the distribution recovery property of the initial data. Specifically, under mild data assumptions, we derive an approximation error bound for the score network of latent DiTs, which is sub-linear in the latent space dimension. Additionally, we derive the corresponding sample complexity bound and show that the data distribution generated from the estimated score function converges toward a proximate area of the original one.Computationally, we characterize the hardness of both forward inference and backward computation of latent DiTs, assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). For forward inference, we identify efficient criteria for all possible latent DiTs inference algorithms and showcase our theory by pushing the efficiency toward almost-linear time inference. For backward computation, we leverage the low-rank structure within the gradient computation of DiTs training for possible algorithmic speedup. Specifically, we show that such speedup achieves almost-linear time latent DiTs training by casting the DiTs gradient as a series of chained low-rank approximations with bounded error.Under the low-dimensional assumption, we show that the statistical rates and the computational efficiency are all dominated by the dimension of the subspace, suggesting that latent DiTs have the potential to bypass the challenges associated with the high dimensionality of initial data."
Poster,On the Ability of Developers' Training Data Preservation of Learnware,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93115,"Hao-Yi Lei, Zhi-Hao Tan, Zhi-Hua Zhou","The learnware paradigm aims to enable users to leverage numerous existing well-trained models instead of building machine learning models from scratch. In this paradigm, developers worldwide can submit their well-trained models spontaneously into a learnware dock system, and the system helps developers generate specification for each model to form a learnware. As the key component, a specification should characterize the capabilities of the model, enabling it to be adequately identified and reused, while preserving the developer's original data. Recently, the RKME (Reduced Kernel Mean Embedding) specification was proposed and most commonly utilized. This paper provides a theoretical analysis of RKME specification about its preservation ability for developer's training data. By modeling it as a geometric problem on manifolds and utilizing tools from geometric analysis, we prove that the RKME specification is able to disclose none of the developer's original data and possesses robust defense against common inference attacks, while preserving sufficient information for effective learnware identification."
Poster,On the Adversarial Robustness of Benjamini Hochberg,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96573,"Louis Chen, Roberto Szechtman, Matan Seri","The Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure is widely used to control the false detection rate (FDR) in multiple testing. Applications of this control abound in drug discovery, forensics, anomaly detection, and, in particular, machine learning, ranging from nonparametric outlier detection to out-of-distribution detection and one-class classification methods. Considering this control could be relied upon in critical safety/security contexts, we investigate its adversarial robustness. More precisely, we study under what conditions BH does and does not exhibit adversarial robustness, we present a class of simple and easily implementable adversarial test-perturbation algorithms, and we perform computational experiments. With our algorithms, we demonstrate that there are conditions under which BH's control can be significantly broken with relatively few (even just one) test score perturbation(s), and provide non-asymptotic guarantees on the expected adversarial-adjustment to FDR. Our technical analysis involves a combinatorial reframing of the BH procedure as a ``balls into bins'' process, and drawing a connection to generalized ballot problems to facilitate an information-theoretic approach for deriving non-asymptotic lower bounds."
Poster,On the Benefits of Public Representations for Private Transfer Learning under Distribution Shift,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96063,"Pratiksha Thaker, Amrith Setlur, Steven Wu, Virginia Smith","Public pretraining is a promising approach to improve differentially private model training. However, recent work has noted that many positive research results studying this paradigm only consider in-distribution tasks, and may not apply to settings where there is distribution shift between the pretraining and finetuning data---a scenario that is likely when finetuning private tasks due to the sensitive nature of the data. In this work, we show empirically across three tasks that even in settings with large distribution shift, where both zero-shot performance from public data and training from scratch with private data give unusably weak results, public features can in fact improve private training accuracy by up to 67\% over private training from scratch. We provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon, showing that if the public and private data share a low-dimensional representation, public representations can improve the sample complexity of private training even if it is \emph{impossible} to learn the private task from the public data alone. Altogether, our results provide evidence that public data can indeed make private training practical in realistic settings of extreme distribution shift."
