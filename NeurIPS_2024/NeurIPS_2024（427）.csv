Poster,UniBias: Unveiling and Mitigating LLM Bias through Internal Attention and FFN Manipulation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93794,"Hanzhang Zhou, Zijian Feng, Zixiao Zhu, Junlang Qian, Kezhi Mao","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks using the in-context learning (ICL) paradigm. However, their effectiveness is often compromised by inherent bias, leading to prompt brittleness—sensitivity to design settings such as example selection, order, and prompt formatting. Previous studies have addressed LLM bias through external adjustment of model outputs, but the internal mechanisms that lead to such bias remain unexplored. Our work delves into these mechanisms, particularly investigating how feedforward neural networks (FFNs) and attention heads result in the bias of LLMs. By Interpreting the contribution of individual FFN vectors and attention heads, we identify the biased LLM components that skew LLMs' prediction toward specific labels. To mitigate these biases, we introduce UniBias, an inference-only method that effectively identifies and eliminates biased FFN vectors and attention heads. Extensive experiments across 12 NLP datasets demonstrate that UniBias significantly enhances ICL performance and alleviates prompt brittleness of LLMs."
Poster,UniDSeg: Unified Cross-Domain 3D Semantic Segmentation via Visual Foundation Models Prior,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94354,"Yao Wu, Mingwei Xing, Yachao Zhang, Xiaotong Luo, Yuan Xie, Yanyun Qu","3D semantic segmentation using an adapting model trained from a source domain with or without accessing unlabeled target-domain data is the fundamental task in computer vision, containing domain adaptation and domain generalization.The essence of simultaneously solving cross-domain tasks is to enhance the generalizability of the encoder.In light of this, we propose a groundbreaking universal method with the help of off-the-shelf Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) to boost the adaptability and generalizability of cross-domain 3D semantic segmentation, dubbed $\textbf{UniDSeg}$.Our method explores the VFMs prior and how to harness them, aiming to inherit the recognition ability of VFMs.Specifically, this method introduces layer-wise learnable blocks to the VFMs, which hinges on alternately learning two representations during training: (i) Learning visual prompt. The 3D-to-2D transitional prior and task-shared knowledge is captured from the prompt space, and then (ii) Learning deep query. Spatial Tunability is constructed to the representation of distinct instances driven by prompts in the query space.Integrating these representations into a cross-modal learning framework, UniDSeg efficiently mitigates the domain gap between 2D and 3D modalities, achieving unified cross-domain 3D semantic segmentation.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across widely recognized tasks and datasets, all achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Remarkably, UniDSeg achieves 57.5\%/54.4\% mIoU on ``A2D2/sKITTI'' for domain adaptive/generalized tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Barcaaaa/UniDSeg."
Poster,Unified Covariate Adjustment for Causal Inference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94547,"Yonghan Jung, Jin Tian, Elias Bareinboim","Causal effect identification and estimation are two crucial tasks in causal inference. Although causal effect identification has been theoretically resolved, many existing estimators only address a subset of scenarios, known as the sequential back-door adjustment (SBD) (Pearl and Robins, 1995) or g-formula (Robins, 1986). Recent efforts for developing general-purpose estimators with broader coverage, incorporating the front-door adjustment (FD) (Pearl, 2000) and more, lack scalability due to the high computational cost of summing over high-dimensional variables. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that achieves broad coverage of causal estimands beyond the SBD, incorporating various sum-product functionals like the FD, while maintaining scalability -- estimated in polynomial time relative to the number of variables and samples. Specifically, we present the class of UCA for which a scalable and doubly robust estimator is developed. In particular, we illustrate the expressiveness of UCA for a wide spectrum of causal estimands (e.g., SBD, FD, and more) in causal inference. We then develop an estimator that exhibits computational efficiency and doubly robustness. The scalability and robustness of the proposed framework are verified through simulations."
Poster,Unified Domain Generalization and Adaptation for Multi-View 3D Object Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93787,"Gyusam Chang, Jiwon Lee, Donghyun Kim, Jinkyu Kim, Dongwook Lee, Daehyun Ji, Sujin Jang, Sangpil Kim","Recent advances in 3D object detection leveraging multi-view cameras have demonstrated their practical and economical value in various challenging vision tasks.However, typical supervised learning approaches face challenges in achieving satisfactory adaptation toward unseen and unlabeled target datasets (i.e., direct transfer) due to the inevitable geometric misalignment between the source and target domains.In practice, we also encounter constraints on resources for training models and collecting annotations for the successful deployment of 3D object detectors.In this paper, we propose Unified Domain Generalization and Adaptation (UDGA), a practical solution to mitigate those drawbacks.We first propose Multi-view Overlap Depth Constraint that leverages the strong association between multi-view, significantly alleviating geometric gaps due to perspective view changes.Then, we present a Label-Efficient Domain Adaptation approach to handle unfamiliar targets with significantly fewer amounts of labels (i.e., 1$\%$ and 5$\%)$, while preserving well-defined source knowledge for training efficiency.Overall, UDGA framework enables stable detection performance in both source and target domains, effectively bridging inevitable domain gaps, while demanding fewer annotations.We demonstrate the robustness of UDGA with large-scale benchmarks: nuScenes, Lyft, and Waymo, where our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods."
Poster,Unified Generative and Discriminative Training for Multi-modal Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93174,"Wei Chow, Juncheng Li, Qifan Yu, Kaihang Pan, Hao Fei, Zhiqi Ge, Shuaiyang, Siliang Tang, Hanwang Zhang, QIANRU SUN","In recent times, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been trained under two predominant paradigms. Generative training has enabled Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to tackle various complex tasks, yet issues such as hallucinations and weak object discrimination persist. Discriminative training, exemplified by models like CLIP, excels in zero-shot image-text classification and retrieval, yet struggles with complex scenarios requiring fine-grained semantic differentiation. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a unified approach that integrates the strengths of both paradigms. Considering interleaved image-text sequences as the general format of input samples, we introduce a structure-induced training strategy that imposes semantic relationships between input samples and the MLLM’s hidden state. This approach enhances the MLLM’s ability to capture global semantics and distinguish fine-grained semantics. By leveraging dynamic sequence alignment within the Dynamic Time Warping framework and integrating a novel kernel for fine-grained semantic differentiation, our method effectively balances generative and discriminative tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple generative tasks, especially those requiring cognitive and discrimination abilities. Additionally, our method surpasses discriminative benchmarks in interleaved and fine-grained retrieval tasks. By employing a retrieval-augmented generation strategy, our approach further enhances performance in some generative tasks within one model, offering a promising direction for future research in vision-language modeling."
Poster,Unified Gradient-Based Machine Unlearning with Remain Geometry Enhancement,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94324,"Zhehao Huang, Xinwen Cheng, JingHao Zheng, Haoran Wang, Zhengbao He, Tao Li, Xiaolin Huang","Machine unlearning (MU) has emerged to enhance the privacy and trustworthiness of deep neural networks. Approximate MU is a practical method for large-scale models. Our investigation into approximate MU starts with identifying the steepest descent direction, minimizing the output Kullback-Leibler divergence to exact MU inside a parameters' neighborhood. This probed direction decomposes into three components: weighted forgetting gradient ascent, fine-tuning retaining gradient descent, and a weight saliency matrix. Such decomposition derived from Euclidean metric encompasses most existing gradient-based MU methods. Nevertheless, adhering to Euclidean space may result in sub-optimal iterative trajectories due to the overlooked geometric structure of the output probability space. We suggest embedding the unlearning update into a manifold rendered by the remaining geometry, incorporating second-order Hessian from the remaining data. It helps prevent effective unlearning from interfering with the retained performance. However, computing the second-order Hessian for large-scale models is intractable. To efficiently leverage the benefits of Hessian modulation, we propose a fast-slow parameter update strategy to implicitly approximate the up-to-date salient unlearning direction.Free from specific modal constraints, our approach is adaptable across computer vision unlearning tasks, including classification and generation. Extensive experiments validate our efficacy and efficiency. Notably, our method successfully performs class-forgetting on ImageNet using DiT and forgets a class on CIFAR-10 using DDPM in just 50 steps, compared to thousands of steps required by previous methods.

Poster,Unified Graph Augmentations for Generalized Contrastive Learning on Graphs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93939,"Jiaming Zhuo, Yintong Lu, Hui Ning, Kun Fu, bingxin niu, Dongxiao He, Chuan Wang, Yuanfang Guo, Zhen Wang, Xiaochun Cao, Liang Yang","In real-world scenarios, networks (graphs) and their tasks possess unique characteristics, requiring the development of a versatile graph augmentation (GA) to meet the varied demands of network analysis. Unfortunately, most Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) frameworks are hampered by the specificity, complexity, and incompleteness of their GA techniques. Firstly, GAs designed for specific scenarios may compromise the universality of models if mishandled. Secondly, the process of identifying and generating optimal augmentations generally involves substantial computational overhead. Thirdly, the effectiveness of the GCL, even the learnable ones, is constrained by the finite selection of GAs available. To overcome the above limitations, this paper introduces a novel unified GA module dubbed UGA after reinterpreting the mechanism of GAs in GCLs from a message-passing perspective. Theoretically, this module is capable of unifying any explicit GAs, including node, edge, attribute, and subgraph augmentations. Based on the proposed UGA, a novel generalized GCL framework dubbed Graph cOntrastive UnifieD Augmentations (GOUDA) is proposed. It seamlessly integrates widely adopted contrastive losses and an introduced independence loss to fulfill the common requirements of consistency and diversity of augmentation across diverse scenarios. Evaluations across various datasets and tasks demonstrate the generality and efficiency of the proposed GOUDA over existing state-of-the-art GCLs."
Poster,Unified Guidance for Geometry-Conditioned Molecular Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95815,"Sirine Ayadi, Leon Hetzel, Johanna Sommer, Fabian Theis, Stephan Günnemann","Effectively designing molecular geometries is essential to advancing pharmaceutical innovations, a domain, which has experienced great attention through the success of generative models and, in particular, diffusion models. However, current molecular diffusion models are tailored towards a specific downstream task and lack adaptability. We introduce UniGuide, a framework for controlled geometric guidance of unconditional diffusion models that allows flexible conditioning during inference without the requirement of extra training or networks. We show how applications such as structure-based, fragment-based, and ligand-based drug design are formulated in the UniGuide framework and demonstrate on-par or superior performance compared to specialised models. Offering a more versatile approach, UniGuide has the potential to streamline the development of molecular generative models, allowing them to be readily used in diverse application scenarios."
Poster,Unified Insights: Harnessing Multi-modal Data for Phenotype Imputation via View Decoupling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96387,"Qiannan Zhang, Weishen Pan, Zilong Bai, Chang Su, Fei Wang","Phenotype imputation plays a crucial role in improving comprehensive and accurate medical evaluation, which in turn can optimize patient treatment and bolster the reliability of clinical research. Despite the adoption of various techniques, multi-modal biological data, which can provide crucial insights into a patient's overall health, is often overlooked. With multi-modal biological data, patient characterization can be enriched from two distinct views: the biological view and the phenotype view. However, the heterogeneity and imprecise nature of the multimodal data still pose challenges in developing an effective method to model from two views. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to incorporate multi-modal biological data via view decoupling. Specifically, we segregate the modeling of biological data from phenotype data in a graph-based learning framework. From the biological view, the latent factors in biological data are discovered to model patient correlation. From the phenotype view, phenotype co-occurrence can be modeled to reveal patterns across patients. Then patients are encoded from these two distinct views. To mitigate the influence of noise and irrelevant information in biological data, we devise a cross-view contrastive knowledge distillation aimed at distilling insights from the biological view to enhance phenotype imputation. We show that phenotype imputation with the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models on the real-world biomedical database."
Poster,Unified Lexical Representation for Interpretable Visual-Language Alignment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93063,"Yifan Li, Yikai Wang, Yanwei Fu, Dongyu Ru, Zheng Zhang, Tong He","Visual-Language Alignment (VLA) has gained a lot of attention since CLIP's groundbreaking work. Although CLIP performs well, the typical direct latent feature alignment lacks clarity in its representation and similarity scores. On the other hand, lexical representation, a vector whose element represents the similarity between the sample and a word from the vocabulary, is a natural sparse representation and interpretable, providing exact matches for individual words.However, lexical representations are difficult to learn due to no ground-truth supervision and false-discovery issues, and thus requires complex design to train effectively.In this paper, we introduce LexVLA, a more interpretable VLA framework by learning a unified lexical representation for both modalities without complex design. We use DINOv2 as our visual model for its local-inclined features and Llama 2, a generative language model, to leverage its in-context lexical prediction ability.To avoid the false discovery, we propose an overuse penalty to refrain the lexical representation from falsely frequently activating meaningless words.We demonstrate that these two pre-trained uni-modal models can be well-aligned by fine-tuning on the modest multi-modal dataset and avoid intricate training configurations. On cross-modal retrieval benchmarks, LexVLA, trained on the CC-12M multi-modal dataset, outperforms baselines fine-tuned on larger datasets (e.g., YFCC15M) and those trained from scratch on even bigger datasets (e.g., 1.1B data, including CC-12M).We conduct extensive experiments to analyze LexVLA.
