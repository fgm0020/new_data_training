Poster,BrainBits: How Much of the Brain are Generative Reconstruction Methods Using?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95678,"David Mayo, Christopher Wang, Asa Harbin, Abdulrahman Alabdulkareem, Albert Shaw, Boris Katz, Andrei Barbu","When evaluating stimuli reconstruction results it is tempting to assume that higher fidelity text and image generation is due to an improved understanding of the brain or  more powerful signal extraction from neural recordings. However, in practice, new reconstruction methods could improve performance for at least three other reasons: learning more about the distribution of stimuli, becoming better at reconstructing text or images in general, or exploiting weaknesses in current image and/or text evaluation metrics. Here we disentangle how much of the reconstruction is due to these other factors vs. productively using the neural recordings. We introduce BrainBits, a method that uses a bottleneck to quantify the amount of signal extracted from neural recordings that is actually necessary to reproduce a method's reconstruction fidelity. We find that it takes surprisingly little information from the brain to produce reconstructions with high fidelity. In these cases, it is clear that the priors of the methods' generative models are so powerful that the outputs they produce extrapolate far beyond the neural signal they decode. Given that reconstructing stimuli can be improved independently by either improving signal extraction from the brain or by building more powerful generative models, improving the latter may fool us into thinking we are improving the former. We propose that methods should report a method-specific random baseline, a reconstruction ceiling, and a curve of performance as a function of bottleneck size, with the ultimate goal of using more of the neural recordings."
Poster,Brain-JEPA: Brain Dynamics Foundation Model with Gradient Positioning and Spatiotemporal Masking,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94113,"Zijian Dong, Ruilin Li, Yilei Wu, Thuan Tinh Nguyen, Joanna Chong, Fang Ji, Nathanael Tong, Christopher Chen, Juan Helen Zhou","We introduce *Brain-JEPA*, a brain dynamics foundation model with the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA). This pioneering model achieves state-of-the-art performance in demographic prediction, disease diagnosis/prognosis, and trait prediction through fine-tuning. Furthermore, it excels in off-the-shelf evaluations (e.g., linear probing) and demonstrates superior generalizability across different ethnic groups, surpassing the previous large model for brain activity significantly. Brain-JEPA incorporates two innovative techniques: **Brain Gradient Positioning** and **Spatiotemporal Masking**. Brain Gradient Positioning introduces a functional coordinate system for brain functional parcellation, enhancing the positional encoding of different Regions of Interest (ROIs). Spatiotemporal Masking, tailored to the unique characteristics of fMRI data, addresses the challenge of heterogeneous time-series patches. These methodologies enhance model performance and advance our understanding of the neural circuits underlying cognition. Overall, Brain-JEPA is paving the way to address pivotal questions of building brain functional coordinate system and masking brain activity at the AI-neuroscience interface, and setting a potentially new paradigm in brain activity analysis through downstream adaptation."
Poster,Brain Treebank: Large-scale intracranial recordings from naturalistic language stimuli,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97751,"Christopher Wang, Adam Yaari, Aaditya Singh, Vighnesh Subramaniam, Dana Rosenfarb, Jan DeWitt, Pranav Misra, Joseph Madsen, Scellig Stone, Gabriel Kreiman, Boris Katz, Ignacio Cases, Andrei Barbu","We present the Brain Treebank, a large-scale dataset of electrophysiological neural responses, recorded from intracranial probes while 10 subjects watched one or more Hollywood movies. Subjects watched on average 2.6 Hollywood movies, for an average viewing time of 4.3 hours, and a total of 43 hours. The audio track for each movie was transcribed with manual corrections. Word onsets were manually annotated on spectrograms of the audio track for each movie. Each transcript was automatically parsed and manually corrected into the universal dependencies (UD) formalism, assigning a part of speech to every word and a dependency parse to every sentence. In total, subjects heard over 38,000 sentences (223,000 words), while they had on average 168 electrodes implanted. This is the largest dataset of intracranial recordings featuring grounded naturalistic language, one of the largest English UD treebanks in general, and one of only a few UD treebanks aligned to multimodal features. We hope that this dataset serves as a bridge between linguistic concepts, perception, and their neural representations. To that end, we present an analysis of which electrodes are sensitive to language features while also mapping out a rough time course of language processing across these electrodes.

Poster,Breaking Determinism: Fuzzy Modeling of Sequential Recommendation Using Discrete State Space Diffusion Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94096,"Wenjia Xie, Hao Wang, Luankang Zhang, Rui Zhou, Defu Lian, Enhong Chen","Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict items that users may be interested in based on their historical behavior sequences. We revisit SR from a novel information-theoretic perspective and find that conventional sequential modeling methods fail to adequately capture the randomness and unpredictability of user behavior. Inspired by fuzzy information processing theory, this paper introduces the DDSR model, which uses fuzzy sets of interaction sequences to overcome the limitations and better capture the evolution of users' real interests. Formally based on diffusion transition processes in discrete state spaces, which is unlike common diffusion models such as DDPM that operate in continuous domains. It is better suited for discrete data, using structured transitions instead of arbitrary noise introduction to avoid information loss. Additionally, to address the inefficiency of matrix transformations due to the vast discrete space, we use semantic labels derived from quantization or RQ-VAE to replace item IDs, enhancing efficiency and improving cold start issues. Testing on three public benchmark datasets shows that DDSR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in various settings, demonstrating its potential and effectiveness in handling SR tasks."
Poster,Breaking Long-Tailed Learning Bottlenecks: A Controllable Paradigm with Hypernetwork-Generated Diverse Experts,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94811,"Zhe Zhao, HaiBin Wen, Zikang Wang, Pengkun Wang, Fanfu Wang, Song Lai, Qingfu Zhang, Yang Wang","Traditional long-tailed learning methods often perform poorly when dealing with inconsistencies between training and test data distributions, and they cannot flexibly adapt to different user preferences for trade-offs between head and tail classes. To address this issue, we propose a novel long-tailed learning paradigm that aims to tackle distribution shift in real-world scenarios and accommodate different user preferences for the trade-off between head and tail classes. We generate a set of diverse expert models via hypernetworks to cover all possible distribution scenarios, and optimize the model ensemble to adapt to any test distribution. Crucially, in any distribution scenario, we can flexibly output a dedicated model solution that matches the user's preference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves higher performance ceilings but also effectively overcomes distribution shift while allowing controllable adjustments according to user preferences. We provide new insights and a paradigm for the long-tailed learning problem, greatly expanding its applicability in practical scenarios.

Poster,Breaking Semantic Artifacts for Generalized AI-generated Image Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95403,"Chende Zheng, Chenhao Lin, Zhengyu Zhao, Hang Wang, Xu Guo, Shuai Liu, Chao Shen","With the continuous evolution of AI-generated images, the generalized detection of them has become a crucial aspect of AI security. Existing detectors have focused on cross-generator generalization, while it remains unexplored whether these detectors can generalize across different image scenes, e.g., images from different datasets with different semantics. In this paper, we reveal that existing detectors suffer from substantial Accuracy drops in such cross-scene generalization. In particular, we attribute their failures to ''semantic artifacts'' in both real and generated images, to which detectors may overfit. To break such ''semantic artifacts'', we propose a simple yet effective approach based on conducting an image patch shuffle and then training an end-to-end patch-based classifier. We conduct a comprehensive open-world evaluation on 31 test sets, covering 7 Generative Adversarial Networks, 18 (variants of) Diffusion Models, and another 6 CNN-based generative models. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous approaches by 2.08\% (absolute) on average regarding cross-scene detection Accuracy. We also notice the superiority of our approach in open-world generalization, with an average Accuracy improvement of 10.59\% (absolute) across all test sets.

Poster,Breaking the curse of dimensionality in structured density estimation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94337,"Robert A. Vandermeulen, Wai Ming Tai, Bryon Aragam","We consider the problem of estimating a structured multivariate density, subject to Markov conditions implied by an undirected graph. In the worst case, without Markovian assumptions, this problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Our main result shows how the curse of dimensionality can be avoided or greatly alleviated under the Markov property, and applies to arbitrary graphs. While existing results along these lines focus on sparsity or manifold assumptions, we introduce a new graphical quantity called ``graph resilience'' and show that it dictates the optimal sample complexity. Surprisingly, although one might expect the sample complexity of this problem to scale with local graph parameters such as the degree, this turns out not to be the case. Through explicit examples, we compute uniform deviation bounds and illustrate how the curse of dimensionality in density estimation can thus be circumvented. Notable examples where the rate improves substantially include sequential, hierarchical, and spatial data."
Poster,Breaking the False Sense of Security in Backdoor Defense through Re-Activation Attack,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96060,"Mingli Zhu, Siyuan Liang, Baoyuan Wu","Deep neural networks face persistent challenges in defending against backdoor attacks, leading to an ongoing battle between attacks and defenses. While existing backdoor defense strategies have shown promising performance on reducing attack success rates, can we confidently claim that the backdoor threat has truly been eliminated from the model? To address it, we re-investigate the characteristics of the backdoored models after defense (denoted as defense models). Surprisingly, we find that the original backdoors still exist in defense models derived from existing post-training defense strategies, and the backdoor existence is measured by a novel metric called backdoor existence coefficient. It implies that the backdoors just lie dormant rather than being eliminated. To further verify this finding, we empirically show that these dormant backdoors can be easily re-activated during inference stage, by manipulating the original trigger with well-designed tiny perturbation using universal adversarial attack. More practically, we extend our backdoor re-activation to black-box scenario, where the defense model can only be queried by the adversary during inference stage, and develop two effective methods, i.e., query-based and transfer-based backdoor re-activation attacks. The effectiveness of the proposed methods are verified on both image classification and multimodal contrastive learning (i.e., CLIP) tasks. In conclusion, this work uncovers a critical vulnerability that has never been explored in existing defense strategies, emphasizing the urgency of designing more robust and advanced backdoor defense mechanisms in the future."
Poster,BricksRL: A Platform for Democratizing Robotics and  Reinforcement Learning Research and Education with LEGO,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96358,"Sebastian Dittert, Vincent Moens, Gianni De Fabritiis","We present BricksRL, a platform designed to democratize access to robotics for reinforcement learning research and education. BricksRL facilitates the creation, design, and training of custom LEGO robots in the real world by interfacing them with the TorchRL library for reinforcement learning agents. The integration of TorchRL with the LEGO hubs, via Bluetooth bidirectional communication, enables state-of-the-art reinforcement learning training on GPUs for a wide variety of LEGO builds. This offers a flexible and cost-efficient approach for scaling and also provides a robust infrastructure for robot-environment-algorithm communication. We present various experiments across tasks and robot configurations, providing built plans and training results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inexpensive LEGO robots can be trained end-to-end in the real world to achieve simple tasks, with training times typically under 120 minutes on a normal laptop. Moreover, we show how users can extend the capabilities, exemplified by the successful integration of non-LEGO sensors. By enhancing accessibility to both robotics and reinforcement learning, BricksRL establishes a strong foundation for democratized robotic learning in research and educational settings."
Poster,Bridge-IF: Learning Inverse Protein Folding with Markov Bridges,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95261,"Yiheng Zhu, Jialu Wu, Qiuyi Li, Jiahuan Yan, Mingze Yin, Wei Wu, Mingyang Li, Jieping Ye, Zheng Wang, Jian Wu","Inverse protein folding is a fundamental task in computational protein design, which aims to design protein sequences that fold into the desired backbone structures. While the development of machine learning algorithms for this task has seen significant success, the prevailing approaches, which predominantly employ a discriminative formulation, frequently encounter the error accumulation issue and often fail to capture the extensive variety of plausible sequences. To fill these gaps, we propose Bridge-IF, a generative diffusion bridge model for inverse folding, which is designed to learn the probabilistic dependency between the distributions of backbone structures and protein sequences. Specifically, we harness an expressive structure encoder to propose a discrete, informative prior derived from structures, and establish a Markov bridge to connect this prior with native sequences. During the inference stage, Bridge-IF progressively refines the prior sequence, culminating in a more plausible design. Moreover, we introduce a reparameterization perspective on Markov bridge models, from which we derive a simplified loss function that facilitates more effective training. We also modulate protein language models (PLMs) with structural conditions to precisely approximate the Markov bridge process, thereby significantly enhancing generation performance while maintaining parameter-efficient training. Extensive experiments on well-established benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge-IF predominantly surpasses existing baselines in sequence recovery and excels in the design of plausible proteins with high foldability.
