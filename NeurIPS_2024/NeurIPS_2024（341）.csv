Poster,Resfusion: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Image Restoration Based on Prior Residual Noise,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95696,"Zhenning Shi, Haoshuai Zheng, Chen Xu, Changsheng Dong, Bin Pan, Xie xueshuo, Along He, Tao Li, Huazhu Fu","Recently, research on denoising diffusion models has expanded its application to the field of image restoration. Traditional diffusion-based image restoration methods utilize degraded images as conditional input to effectively guide the reverse generation process, without modifying the original denoising diffusion process. However, since the degraded images already include low-frequency information, starting from Gaussian white noise will result in increased sampling steps. We propose Resfusion, a general framework that incorporates the residual term into the diffusion forward process, starting the reverse process directly from the noisy degraded images. The form of our inference process is consistent with the DDPM. We introduced a weighted residual noise, named resnoise, as the prediction target and explicitly provide the quantitative relationship between the residual term and the noise term in resnoise. By leveraging a smooth equivalence transformation, Resfusion determine the optimal acceleration step and maintains the integrity of existing noise schedules, unifying the training and inference processes. The experimental results demonstrate that Resfusion exhibits competitive performance on ISTD dataset, LOL dataset and Raindrop dataset with only five sampling steps. Furthermore, Resfusion can be easily applied to image generation and emerges with strong versatility. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/nkicsl/Resfusion."
Poster,Reshuffling Resampling Splits Can Improve Generalization of Hyperparameter Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96162,"Thomas Nagler, Lennart Schneider, Bernd Bischl, Matthias Feurer","Hyperparameter optimization is crucial for obtaining peak performance of machine learning models. The standard protocol evaluates various hyperparameter configurations using a resampling estimate of the generalization error to guide optimization and select a final hyperparameter configuration. Without much evidence, paired resampling splits, i.e., either a fixed train-validation split or a fixed cross-validation scheme, are often recommended. We show that, surprisingly, reshuffling the splits for every configuration often improves the final model's generalization performance on unseen data. Our theoretical analysis explains how reshuffling affects the asymptotic behavior of the validation loss surface and provides a bound on the expected regret in the limiting regime. This bound connects the potential benefits of reshuffling to the signal and noise characteristics of the underlying optimization problem. We confirm our theoretical results in a  controlled simulation study and demonstrate the practical usefulness of reshuffling in a large-scale, realistic hyperparameter optimization experiment. While reshuffling leads to test performances that are competitive with using fixed splits, it drastically improves results for a single train-validation holdout protocol and can often make holdout become competitive with standard CV while being computationally cheaper."
Poster,Resolving Discrepancies in Compute-Optimal Scaling of Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96646,"Tomer Porian, Mitchell Wortsman, Jenia Jitsev, Ludwig Schmidt, Yair Carmon","Kaplan et al. and Hoffmann et al. developed influential scaling laws for the optimal model size as a function of the compute budget, but these laws yield substantially different predictions. We explain the discrepancy by reproducing the Kaplan scaling law on two datasets (OpenWebText2 and RefinedWeb) and identifying three factors causing the difference: last layer computational cost, warmup duration, and scale-dependent optimizer tuning. With these factors corrected, we obtain excellent agreement with the Hoffmann et al. (i.e., ""Chinchilla"") scaling law. Counter to a hypothesis of Hoffmann et al., we find that careful learning rate decay is not essential for the validity of their scaling law. As a secondary result, we derive scaling laws for the optimal learning rate and batch size, finding that tuning the AdamW $\beta_2$ parameter is essential at lower batch sizes."
Poster,Resource-Aware Federated Self-Supervised Learning with Global Class Representations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95354,"Mingyi Li, Xiao Zhang, Qi Wang, Tengfei LIU, Ruofan Wu, Weiqiang Wang, Fuzhen Zhuang, Hui Xiong, Dongxiao Yu","Due to the heterogeneous architectures and class skew, the global representation models training in resource-adaptive federated self-supervised learning face with tricky challenges: $\textit{deviated representation abilities}$ and $\textit{inconsistent representation spaces}$. In this work, we are the first to propose a multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework, namely $\textit{FedMKD}$, to learn global representations with whole class knowledge from heterogeneous clients even under extreme class skew. Firstly, the adaptive knowledge integration mechanism is designed to learn better representations from all heterogeneous models with deviated representation abilities. Then the weighted combination of the self-supervised loss and the distillation loss can support the global model to encode all classes from clients into a unified space. Besides, the global knowledge anchored alignment module can make the local representation spaces close to the global spaces, which further improves the representation abilities of local ones. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of $\textit{FedMKD}$ which outperforms state-of-the-art baselines 4.78\% under linear evaluation on average."
Poster,ReST-MCTS*: LLM Self-Training via Process Reward Guided Tree Search,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96343,"Dan Zhang, Sining Zhoubian, Ziniu Hu, Yisong Yue, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang","Recent methodologies in LLM self-training mostly rely on LLM generating responses and filtering those with correct output answers as training data. This approach often yields a low-quality fine-tuning training set (e.g., incorrect plans or intermediate reasoning). In this paper, we develop a reinforced self-training approach, called ReST-MCTS*, based on integrating process reward guidance with tree search MCTS* for collecting higher-quality reasoning traces as well as per-step value to train policy and reward models. ReST-MCTS* circumvents the per-step manual annotation typically used to train process rewards by tree-search-based reinforcement learning: Given oracle final correct answers, ReST-MCTS* is able to infer the correct process rewards by estimating the probability this step can help lead to the correct answer. These inferred rewards serve dual purposes: they act as value targets for further refining the process reward model and also facilitate the selection of high-quality traces for policy model self-training. We first show that the tree-search policy in ReST-MCTS* achieves higher accuracy compared with prior LLM reasoning baselines such as Best-of-N and Tree-of-Thought, within the same search budget. We then show that by using traces searched by this tree-search policy as training data, we can continuously enhance the three language models for multiple iterations, and outperform other self-training algorithms such as ReST$^\text{EM}$ and Self-Rewarding LM."
Poster,RestoreAgent: Autonomous Image Restoration Agent via Multimodal Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93068,"Haoyu Chen, Wenbo Li, JINJIN GU, Jingjing Ren, Sixiang Chen, Tian Ye, Renjing Pei, Kaiwen Zhou, Fenglong Song, Lei Zhu","Natural images captured by mobile devices often suffer from multiple types of degradation, such as noise, blur, and low light. Traditional image restoration methods require manual selection of specific tasks, algorithms, and execution sequences, which is time-consuming and may yield suboptimal results. All-in-one models, though capable of handling multiple tasks, typically support only a limited range and often produce overly smooth, low-fidelity outcomes due to their broad data distribution fitting. To address these challenges, we first define a new pipeline for restoring images with multiple degradations, and then introduce RestoreAgent, an intelligent image restoration system leveraging multimodal large language models. RestoreAgent autonomously assesses the type and extent of degradation in input images and performs restoration through (1) determining the appropriate restoration tasks, (2) optimizing the task sequence, (3) selecting the most suitable models, and (4) executing the restoration. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of RestoreAgent in handling complex degradation, surpassing human experts. Furthermore, the system’s modular design facilitates the fast integration of new tasks and models."
Poster,Rethinking 3D Convolution in $\ell_p$-norm Space,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93901,"Li Zhang, Yan Zhong, Jianan Wang, Zhe Min, RujingWang, Liu Liu","Convolution is a fundamental operation in the 3D backbone. However, under certain conditions, the feature extraction ability of traditional convolution methods may be weakened. In this paper, we introduce a new convolution method based on  $\ell_p$-norm. For theoretical support, we prove the universal approximation theorem for $\ell_p$-norm based convolution, and analyze the robustness and feasibility of  $\ell_p$-norms in 3D point cloud tasks. Concretely, $\ell_{\infty}$-norm based convolution is prone to feature loss. $\ell_2$-norm based convolution is essentially a linear transformation of the traditional convolution.  $\ell_1$-norm based convolution is an economical and effective feature extractor. We propose customized optimization strategies to accelerate the training process of $\ell_1$-norm based Nets and enhance the performance. Besides, a theoretical guarantee is given for the convergence by \textit{regret} argument. We apply our methods to classic networks and conduct related experiments. Experimental results indicate that our approach exhibits competitive performance with traditional CNNs, with lower energy consumption and instruction latency."
Poster,Rethinking Decoders for Transformer-based Semantic Segmentation: A Compression Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95774,"Qishuai Wen, Chun-Guang Li","State-of-the-art methods for Transformer-based semantic segmentation typically adopt Transformer decoders that are used to extract additional embeddings from image embeddings via cross-attention, refine either or both types of embeddings via self-attention, and project image embeddings onto the additional embeddings via dot-product. Despite their remarkable success, these empirical designs still lack theoretical justifications or interpretations, thus hindering potentially principled improvements. In this paper, we argue that there are fundamental connections between semantic segmentation and compression, especially between the Transformer decoders and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). From such a perspective, we derive a white-box, fully attentional DEcoder for PrIncipled semantiC segemenTation (DEPICT), with the interpretations as follows: 1) the self-attention operator refines image embeddings to construct an ideal principal subspace that aligns with the supervision and retains most information; 2) the cross-attention operator seeks to find a low-rank approximation of the refined image embeddings, which is expected to be a set of orthonormal bases of the principal subspace and corresponds to the predefined classes; 3) the dot-product operation yields compact representation for image embeddings as segmentation masks. Experiments conducted on dataset ADE20K find that DEPICT consistently outperforms its black-box counterpart, Segmenter, and it is light weight and more robust."
Poster,Rethinking Deep Thinking: Stable Learning of Algorithms using Lipschitz Constraints,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92936,"Jay Bear, Adam Prugel-Bennett, Jonathon Hare","Iterative algorithms solve problems by taking steps until a solution is reached. Models in the form of Deep Thinking (DT) networks have been demonstrated to learn iterative algorithms in a way that can scale to different sized problems at inference time using recurrent computation and convolutions. However, they are often unstable during training, and have no guarantees of convergence/termination at the solution. This paper addresses the problem of instability by analyzing the growth in intermediate representations, allowing us to build models (referred to as Deep Thinking with Lipschitz Constraints (DT-L)) with many fewer parameters and providing more reliable solutions. Additionally our DT-L formulation provides guarantees of convergence of the learned iterative procedure to a unique solution at inference time. We demonstrate DT-L is capable of robustly learning algorithms which extrapolate to harder problems than in the training set. We benchmark on the traveling salesperson problem to evaluate the capabilities of the modified system in an NP-hard problem where DT fails to learn."
Poster,Rethinking Exploration in Reinforcement Learning with Effective Metric-Based Exploration Bonus,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95213,"Yiming Wang, Kaiyan Zhao, Furui Liu, Leong Hou U","Enhancing exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) through the incorporation of intrinsic rewards, specifically by leveraging *state discrepancy* measures within various metric spaces as exploration bonuses, has emerged as a prevalent strategy to encourage agents to visit novel states. The critical factor lies in how to quantify the difference between adjacent states as *novelty* for promoting effective exploration.Nonetheless, existing methods that evaluate state discrepancy in the latent space under $L_1$ or $L_2$ norm often depend on count-based episodic terms as scaling factors for exploration bonuses, significantly limiting their scalability. Additionally, methods that utilize the bisimulation metric for evaluating state discrepancies face a theory-practice gap due to improper approximations in metric learning, particularly struggling with *hard exploration* tasks. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the **E**ffective **M**etric-based **E**xploration-bonus (EME). EME critically examines and addresses the inherent limitations and approximation inaccuracies of current metric-based state discrepancy methods for exploration, proposing a robust metric for state discrepancy evaluation backed by comprehensive theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we propose the diversity-enhanced scaling factor integrated into the exploration bonus to be dynamically adjusted by the variance of prediction from an ensemble of reward models, thereby enhancing exploration effectiveness in particularly challenging scenarios. Extensive experiments are conducted on hard exploration tasks within Atari games, Minigrid, Robosuite, and Habitat, which illustrate our method's scalability to various scenarios.
