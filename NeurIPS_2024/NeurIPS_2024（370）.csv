Poster,Simulation-Free Training of Neural ODEs on Paired Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95906,"Semin Kim, Jaehoon Yoo, Jinwoo Kim, Yeonwoo Cha, Saehoon Kim, Seunghoon Hong","In this work, we investigate a method for simulation-free training of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) for learning deterministic mappings between paired data. Despite the analogy of NODEs as continuous-depth residual networks, their application in typical supervised learning tasks has not been popular, mainly due to the large number of function evaluations required by ODE solvers and numerical instability in gradient estimation. To alleviate this problem, we employ the flow matching framework for simulation-free training of NODEs, which directly regresses the parameterized dynamics function to a predefined target velocity field. Contrary to generative tasks, however, we show that applying flow matching directly between paired data can often lead to an ill-defined flow that breaks the coupling of the data pairs (e.g., due to crossing trajectories). We propose a simple extension that applies flow matching in the embedding space of data pairs, where the embeddings are learned jointly with the dynamic function to ensure the validity of the flow which is also easier to learn. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both regression and classification tasks, where our method outperforms existing NODEs with a significantly lower number of function evaluations.

Poster,SimVG: A Simple Framework for Visual Grounding with Decoupled Multi-modal Fusion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94210,"Ming Dai, Lingfeng Yang, Yihao Xu, Zhenhua Feng, Wankou Yang","Visual grounding is a common vision task that involves grounding descriptive sentences to the corresponding regions of an image. Most existing methods use independent image-text encoding and apply complex hand-crafted modules or encoder-decoder architectures for modal interaction and query reasoning. However, their performance significantly drops when dealing with complex textual expressions. This is because the former paradigm only utilizes limited downstream data to fit the multi-modal feature fusion. Therefore, it is only effective when the textual expressions are relatively simple. In contrast, given the wide diversity of textual expressions and the uniqueness of downstream training data, the existing fusion module, which extracts multimodal content from a visual-linguistic context, has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we present a simple yet robust transformer-based framework, SimVG, for visual grounding. Specifically, we decouple visual-linguistic feature fusion from downstream tasks by leveraging existing multimodal pre-trained models and incorporating additional object tokens to facilitate deep integration of downstream and pre-training tasks. Furthermore, we design a dynamic weight-balance distillation method in the multi-branch synchronous learning process to enhance the representation capability of the simpler branch. This branch only consists of a lightweight MLP, which simplifies the structure and improves reasoning speed. Experiments on six widely used VG datasets, i.e., RefCOCO/+/g, ReferIt, Flickr30K, and GRefCOCO, demonstrate the superiority of SimVG. Finally, the proposed method not only achieves improvements in efficiency and convergence speed but also attains new state-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/Dmmm1997/SimVG."
Poster,Single Image Reflection Separation via Dual-Stream Interactive Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95086,"Qiming Hu, Hainuo Wang, Xiaojie Guo","Despite satisfactory results on ``easy'' cases of single image reflection separation, prior dual-stream methods still suffer from considerable performance degradation when facing complex ones, i.e, the transmission layer is densely entangled with the reflection having a wide distribution of spatial intensity. The main reasons come from the lack of concern on the feature correlation during interaction, and the limited receptive field. To remedy these deficiencies, this paper presents a Dual-Stream Interactive Transformer (DSIT) design. Specifically, we devise a dual-attention interactive structure that embraces a dual-stream self-attention and a layer-aware dual-stream cross-attention mechanism to simultaneously capture intra-layer and inter-layer feature correlations. Meanwhile, the introduction of attention mechanisms can also mitigate the receptive field limitation. We modulate single-stream pre-trained Transformer embeddings with dual-stream convolutional features through cross-architecture interactions to provide richer semantic priors, thereby further relieving the ill-posedness of the problem. Extensive experimental results reveal the merits of the proposed DSIT over other state-of-the-art alternatives. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/mingcv/DSIT."
Poster,Single Image Unlearning: Efficient Machine Unlearning in Multimodal Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94704,"Jiaqi Li, Qianshan Wei, Chuanyi Zhang, Guilin Qi, Miaozeng Du, Yongrui Chen, Sheng Bi, Fan Liu","Machine unlearning (MU) empowers individuals with the `right to be forgotten' by removing their private or sensitive information encoded in machine learning models. However, it remains uncertain whether MU can be effectively applied to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly in scenarios of forgetting the leaked visual data of concepts. To overcome the challenge, we propose an efficient method, Single Image Unlearning (SIU), to unlearn the visual recognition of a concept by fine-tuning a single associated image for few steps. SIU consists of two key aspects: (i) Constructing Multifaceted fine-tuning data. We introduce four targets, based on which we construct fine-tuning data for the concepts to be forgotten; (ii)  Joint training loss. To synchronously forget the visual recognition of concepts and preserve the utility of MLLMs, we fine-tune MLLMs through a novel Dual Masked KL-divergence Loss combined with Cross Entropy loss. Alongside our method, we establish MMUBench, a new benchmark for MU in MLLMs and introduce a collection of metrics for its evaluation. Experimental results on MMUBench show that SIU completely surpasses the performance of existing methods. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that SIU can avoid invasive membership inference attacks and jailbreak attacks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore MU in MLLMs. We will release the code and benchmark in the near future."
Poster,Single-Loop Stochastic Algorithms for Difference of Max-Structured Weakly Convex Functions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95421,"Quanqi Hu, Qi Qi, Zhaosong Lu, Tianbao Yang","In this paper, we study a class of non-smooth non-convex problems in the form of $\min_{x}[\max_{y\in\mathcal Y}\phi(x, y) - \max_{z\in\mathcal Z}\psi(x, z)]$, where both $\Phi(x) = \max_{y\in\mathcal Y}\phi(x, y)$ and $\Psi(x)=\max_{z\in\mathcal Z}\psi(x, z)$ are weakly convex functions, and $\phi(x, y), \psi(x, z)$ are strongly concave functions in terms of $y$ and $z$, respectively.  It covers two families of problems that have been studied but are missing single-loop stochastic algorithms, i.e., difference of weakly convex functions and weakly convex strongly-concave min-max problems. We propose a stochastic Moreau envelope approximate gradient method dubbed SMAG, the first single-loop algorithm for solving these problems, and provide a state-of-the-art non-asymptotic convergence rate. The key idea of the design is to compute an approximate gradient of the Moreau envelopes of $\Phi, \Psi$ using only one step of stochastic gradient update of the primal and dual variables. Empirically, we conduct experiments on positive-unlabeled (PU) learning and partial area under ROC curve (pAUC) optimization with an adversarial fairness regularizer to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms."
Poster,SIRIUS : Contexual Sparisty with Correction for Efficient LLMs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96580,"Yang Zhou, Zhuoming Chen, Zhaozhuo Xu, Victoria Lin, Beidi Chen","With the blossom of large language models (LLM), inference efficiency becomes increasingly important. Various approximate methods are proposed to reduce the cost at inference time. Contextual Sparsity (CS) is appealing for its training-free nature and its ability to reach a higher compression ratio seemingly without significant performance degradation. However, after a comprehensive evaluation of contextual sparsity methods on various complex generation tasks, we find that although CS succeeds in prompt-understanding tasks, it significantly degrades the model performance for reasoning, deduction, and knowledge-based tasks. Despite the gap in end-to-end accuracy, we observed that sparse models and original models often share the general problem-solving logic and require only a few token corrections to recover the original model performance. This paper introduces SIRIUS, an efficient correction mechanism, which significantly boosts CS models on reasoning tasks while maintaining its efficiency gain. SIRIUS is evaluated on 6 models with 8 difficult generation tasks in reasoning, deduction, and coding and shows consistent effectiveness and efficiency. Also, we carefully develop a system implementation for SIRIUS and show that SIRIUS delivers theoretical latency reduction with roughly a 20% reduction in latency for 8B model on-chip and a 35% reduction in latency for 70B model offloading. We open-source our implementation of Sirius at https://github.com/Infini-AI-Lab/Sirius.git."
Poster,Sketched Lanczos uncertainty score: a low-memory summary of the Fisher information,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96842,"Marco Miani, Lorenzo Beretta, Søren Hauberg","Current uncertainty quantification is memory and compute expensive, which hinders practical uptake. To counter, we develop Sketched Lanczos Uncertainty (SLU): an architecture-agnostic uncertainty score that can be applied to pre-trained neural networks with minimal overhead. Importantly, the memory use of SLU only grows logarithmically with the number of model parameters. We combine Lanczos' algorithm with dimensionality reduction techniques to compute a sketch of the leading eigenvectors of a matrix. Applying this novel algorithm to the Fisher information matrix yields a cheap and reliable uncertainty score. Empirically, SLU yields well-calibrated uncertainties, reliably detects out-of-distribution examples, and consistently outperforms existing methods in the low-memory regime."
Poster,Sketching for Distributed Deep Learning: A Sharper Analysis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96942,"Mayank Shrivastava, Berivan Isik, Qiaobo Li, Sanmi Koyejo, Arindam Banerjee","The high communication cost between the server and the clients is a significant bottleneck in scaling distributed learning for overparametrized deep models. One popular approach for reducing this communication overhead is randomized sketching. However, existing theoretical analyses for sketching-based distributed learning (sketch-DL) either incur a prohibitive dependence on the ambient dimension or need additional restrictive assumptions such as heavy-hitters. Nevertheless, despite existing pessimistic analyses, empirical evidence suggests that sketch-DL is competitive with its uncompressed counterpart, thus motivating a sharper analysis. In this work, we introduce a sharper ambient dimension-independent convergence analysis for sketch-DL using the second-order geometry specified by the loss Hessian. Our results imply ambient dimension-independent communication complexity for sketch-DL. We present empirical results both on the loss Hessian and overall accuracy of sketch-DL supporting our theoretical results. Taken together, our results provide theoretical justification for the observed empirical success of sketch-DL."
Poster,Sketchy Moment Matching: Toward Fast and Provable Data Selection for Finetuning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93035,"Yijun Dong, Viet Hoang Phan, Xiang Pan, Qi Lei","We revisit data selection in a modern context of finetuning from a fundamental perspective. Extending the classical wisdom of variance minimization in low dimensions to high-dimensional finetuning, our generalization analysis unveils the importance of additionally reducing bias induced by low-rank approximation. Inspired by the variance-bias tradeoff in high dimensions from the theory, we introduce Sketchy Moment Matching (SkMM), a scalable data selection scheme with two stages. (i) First, the bias is controlled using gradient sketching that explores the finetuning parameter space for an informative low-dimensional subspace $\mathcal{S}$; (ii) then the variance is reduced over $\mathcal{S}$ via moment matching between the original and selected datasets. Theoretically, we show that gradient sketching is fast and provably accurate: selecting $n$ samples by reducing variance over $\mathcal{S}$ preserves the fast-rate generalization $O(\dim(\mathcal{S})/n)$, independent of the parameter dimension. Empirically, we concretize the variance-bias balance via synthetic experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of SkMM for finetuning in real vision tasks."
Poster,SkiLD: Unsupervised Skill Discovery Guided by Factor Interactions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94028,"Zizhao Wang, Jiaheng Hu, Caleb Chuck, Stephen Chen, Roberto Martín-Martín, Amy Zhang, Scott Niekum, Peter Stone","Unsupervised skill discovery carries the promise that an intelligent agent can learn reusable skills through autonomous, reward-free interactions with environments. Existing unsupervised skill discovery methods learn skills by encouraging distinguishable behaviors that cover diverse states. However, in complex environments with many state factors (e.g., household environments with many objects), learning skills that cover all possible states is impossible, and naively encouraging state diversity often leads to simple skills that are not ideal for solving downstream tasks. This work introduces Skill Discovery from Local Dependencies (SkiLD), which leverages state factorization as a natural inductive bias to guide the skill learning process. The key intuition guiding SkiLD is that skills that induce \textbf{diverse interactions} between state factors are often more valuable for solving downstream tasks. To this end, SkiLD develops a novel skill learning objective that explicitly encourages the mastering of skills that effectively induce different interactions within an environment. We evaluate SkiLD in several domains with challenging, long-horizon sparse reward tasks including a realistic simulated household robot domain, where SkiLD successfully learns skills with clear semantic meaning and shows superior performance compared to existing unsupervised reinforcement learning methods that only maximize state coverage."
