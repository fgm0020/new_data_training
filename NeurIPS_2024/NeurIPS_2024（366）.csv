Poster,Sequoia: Scalable and Robust Speculative Decoding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93418,"Zhuoming Chen, Avner May, Ruslan Svirschevski, Yu-Hsun Huang, Max Ryabinin, Zhihao Jia, Beidi Chen","As the usage of large language models (LLMs) grows, it becomes increasingly important to serve them quickly and efficiently. While speculative decoding has recently emerged as a promising direction for accelerating LLM serving, existing methods are limited in their ability to scale to larger speculation budgets and adapt to different hyperparameters. This paper introduces Sequoia, a scalable and robust algorithm for speculative decoding. To improve scalability, Sequoia introduces a dynamic programming algorithm to find an optimal tree structure for the speculated tokens. To achieve robust speculative decoding, Sequoia uses a novel sampling and verification method that outperforms prior work across different decoding temperatures. Sequoia improves the decoding speed of Llama2-7B, Llama2-13B, and Vicuna-33B on an A100 GPU by up to $4.04\times$, $3.73\times$, and $2.27 \times$. To serve Llama3-70B-Instruct on a single L40 GPU through offloading, Sequoia reduces the per-token decoding latency to 0.60 s/token, $9.5\times$ faster than DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference."
Poster,SeTAR: Out-of-Distribution Detection with Selective Low-Rank Approximation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96549,"Yixia Li, Boya Xiong, Guanhua Chen, Yun Chen","Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the safe deployment of neural networks. Existing CLIP-based approaches perform OOD detection by devising novel scoring functions or sophisticated fine-tuning methods. In this work, we propose SeTAR, a novel, training-free OOD detection method that leverages selective low-rank approximation of weight matrices in vision-language and vision-only models. SeTAR enhances OOD detection via post-hoc modification of the model's weight matrices using a simple greedy search algorithm. Based on SeTAR, we further propose SeTAR+FT, a fine-tuning extension optimizing model performance for OOD detection tasks. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet1K and Pascal-VOC benchmarks show SeTAR's superior performance, reducing the relatively false positive rate by up to 18.95\% and 36.80\% compared to zero-shot and fine-tuning baselines. Ablation studies further validate our approach's effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability across different model backbones. Our work offers a scalable, efficient solution for OOD detection, setting a new state-of-the-art in this area."
Poster,Set-based Neural Network Encoding Without Weight Tying,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94034,"Bruno Andreis, Bedionita Soro, Philip Torr, Sung Ju Hwang","We propose a neural network weight encoding method for network property prediction that utilizes set-to-set and set-to-vector functionsto efficiently encode neural network parameters. Our approach is capable of encoding neural networks in a model zoo of mixed architecture and different parameter sizes as opposed to previous approaches that require custom encoding models for different architectures. Furthermore, our \textbf{S}et-based \textbf{N}eural network \textbf{E}ncoder (SNE) takes into consideration the hierarchical computational structure of neural networks. To respect symmetries inherent in network weight space, we utilize Logit Invariance to learn the required minimal invariance properties. Additionally, we introduce a \textit{pad-chunk-encode} pipeline to efficiently encode neural network layers that is adjustable to computational and memory constraints. We also introduce two new tasks for neural network property prediction: cross-dataset and cross-architecture. In cross-dataset property prediction, we evaluate how well property predictors generalize across model zoos trained on different datasets but of the same architecture. In cross-architecture property prediction, we evaluate how well property predictors transfer to model zoos of different architecture not seen during training. We show that SNE outperforms the relevant baselines on standard benchmarks."
Poster,SETLEXSEM CHALLENGE: Using Set Operations to Evaluate the Lexical and Semantic Robustness of Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97730,"Nicholas Dronen, Bardiya Akhbari, Manish Digambar Gawali","Set theory is foundational to mathematics and, when sets are finite, to reasoning about the world. An intelligent system should perform set operations consistently, regardless of superficial variations in the operands. Initially designed for semantically-oriented NLP tasks, large language models (LLMs) are now being evaluated on algorithmic tasks. Because sets are comprised of arbitrary symbols (e.g. numbers, words), they provide an opportunity to test, systematically, the invariance of LLMs’ algorithmic abilities under simple lexical or semantic variations. To this end, we present the SETLEXSEM CHALLENGE, a synthetic benchmark that evaluates the performance of LLMs on set operations. SETLEXSEM assesses the robustness of LLMs’ instruction-following abilities under various conditions, focusing on the set operations and the nature and construction of the set members. Evaluating seven LLMs with SETLEXSEM, we find that they exhibit poor robust- ness to variation in both operation and operands. We show – via the framework’s systematic sampling of set members along lexical and semantic dimensions – that LLMs are not only not robust to variation along these dimensions but demonstrate unique failure modes in particular, easy-to-create semantic groupings of ""deceptive"" sets. We find that rigorously measuring language model robustness to variation in frequency and length is challenging and present an analysis that measures them in- dependently. The code for reproducing the results of this paper, and for generating the SETLEXSEM CHALLENGE dataset, is available https://github.com/amazon-science/SetLexSem-Challenge."
Poster,SfPUEL: Shape from Polarization under Unknown Environment Light,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93377,"Youwei Lyu, Heng Guo, Kailong Zhang, Si Li, Boxin Shi","Shape from polarization (SfP) benefits from advancements like polarization cameras for single-shot normal estimation, but its performance heavily relies on light conditions. This paper proposes SfPUEL, an end-to-end SfP method to jointly estimate surface normal and material under unknown environment light. To handle this challenging light condition, we design a transformer-based framework for enhancing the perception of global context features. We further propose to integrate photometric stereo (PS) priors from pretrained models to enrich extracted features for high-quality normal predictions. As metallic and dielectric materials exhibit different BRDFs, SfPUEL additionally predicts dielectric and metallic material segmentation to further boost performance. Experimental results on synthetic and our collected real-world dataset demonstrate that SfPUEL significantly outperforms existing SfP and single-shot normal estimation methods. The code and dataset is available at https://github.com/YouweiLyu/SfPUEL."
Poster,SF-V: Single Forward Video Generation Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95305,"Zhixing Zhang, Yanyu Li, Yushu Wu, yanwu xu, Anil Kag, Ivan Skorokhodov, Willi Menapace, Aliaksandr Siarohin, Junli Cao, Dimitris Metaxas, Sergey Tulyakov, Jian Ren","Diffusion-based video generation models have demonstrated remarkable success in obtaining high-fidelity videos through the iterative denoising process. However, these models require multiple denoising steps during sampling, resulting in high computational costs. In this work, we propose a novel approach to obtain single-step video generation models by leveraging adversarial training to fine-tune pre-trained video diffusion models. We show that, through the adversarial training, the multi-steps video diffusion model, i.e., Stable Video Diffusion (SVD), can be trained to perform single forward pass to synthesize high-quality videos, capturing both temporal and spatial dependencies in the video data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive generation quality of synthesized videos with significantly reduced computational overhead for the denoising process (i.e., around $23\times$ speedup compared with SVD and $6\times$ speedup compared with existing works, with even better generation quality), paving the way for real-time video synthesis and editing."
Poster,SG-Bench: Evaluating LLM Safety Generalization Across Diverse Tasks and Prompt Types,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97610,"Yutao Mou, Shikun Zhang, Wei Ye","Ensuring the safety of large language model (LLM) applications is essential for developing trustworthy artificial intelligence. Current LLM safety benchmarks have two limitations. First, they focus solely on either discriminative or generative evaluation paradigms while ignoring their interconnection. Second, they rely on standardized inputs, overlooking the effects of widespread prompting techniques, such as system prompts, few-shot demonstrations, and chain-of-thought prompting. To overcome these issues, we developed SG-Bench, a novel benchmark to assess the generalization of LLM safety across various tasks and prompt types. This benchmark integrates both generative and discriminative evaluation tasks and includes extended data to examine the impact of prompt engineering and jailbreak on LLM safety. Our assessment of 3 advanced proprietary LLMs and 10 open-source LLMs with the benchmark reveals that most LLMs perform worse on discriminative tasks than generative ones, and are highly susceptible to prompts, indicating poor generalization in safety alignment. We also explain these findings quantitatively and qualitatively to provide insights for future research."
Poster,SGD vs GD: Rank Deficiency in Linear Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95034,"Aditya  Vardhan Varre, Margarita Sagitova, Nicolas Flammarion","In this article, we study the behaviour of continuous-time gradient methods on a two-layer linear network with square loss. A dichotomy between SGD and GD is revealed: GD preserves the rank at initialization while (label noise) SGD diminishes the rank regardless of the initialization. We demonstrate this rank deficiency by studying the time evolution of the *determinant* of a matrix of parameters. To further understand this phenomenon, we derive the stochastic differential equation (SDE) governing the eigenvalues of the parameter matrix. This SDE unveils a *replusive force* between the eigenvalues: a key regularization mechanism which induces rank deficiency. Our results are well supported by experiments illustrating the phenomenon beyond linear networks and regression tasks."
Poster,SGLang: Efficient Execution of Structured Language Model Programs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94872,"Lianmin Zheng, Liangsheng Yin, Zhiqiang Xie, Chuyue (Livia) Sun, Jeff Huang, Cody Hao Yu, Shiyi Cao, Christos Kozyrakis, Ion Stoica, Joseph Gonzalez, Clark Barrett, Ying Sheng","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for complex tasks that require multiple generation calls, advanced prompting techniques, control flow, and structured inputs/outputs. However, efficient systems are lacking for programming and executing these applications. We introduce SGLang, a system for efficient execution of complex language model programs. SGLang consists of a frontend language and a runtime. The frontend simplifies programming with primitives for generation and parallelism control. The runtime accelerates execution with novel optimizations like RadixAttention for KV cache reuse and compressed finite state machines for faster structured output decoding. Experiments show that SGLang achieves up to $6.4\times$ higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art inference systems on various large language and multi-modal models on tasks including agent control, logical reasoning, few-shot learning benchmarks, JSON decoding, retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, and multi-turn chat. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang."
Poster,SG-Nav: Online 3D Scene Graph Prompting for LLM-based Zero-shot Object Navigation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95803,"Hang Yin, Xiuwei Xu, Zhenyu Wu, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu","In this paper, we propose a new framework for zero-shot object navigation.Existing zero-shot object navigation methods prompt LLM with the text of spatially closed objects, which lacks enough scene context for in-depth reasoning.To better preserve the information of environment and fully exploit the reasoning ability of LLM, we propose to represent the observed scene with 3D scene graph. The scene graph encodes the relationships between objects, groups and rooms with a LLM-friendly structure, for which we design a hierarchical chain-of-thought prompt to help LLM reason the goal location according to scene context by traversing the nodes and edges.Moreover, benefit from the scene graph representation, we further design a re-perception mechanism to empower the object navigation framework with the ability to correct perception error.We conduct extensive experiments on MP3D, HM3D and RoboTHOR environments, where SG-Nav surpasses previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by more than \textbf{10\%} SR on all benchmarks, while the decision process is explainable. To the best of our knowledge, SG-Nav is the first zero-shot method that achieves even higher performance than supervised object navigation methods on the challenging MP3D benchmark.Code of this project will be released in the final version."
