Poster,VQ-Map: Bird's-Eye-View Map Layout Estimation in Tokenized Discrete Space via Vector Quantization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94493,"Yiwei Zhang, Jin Gao, Fudong Ge, Guan Luo, Bing Li, ZHAO-XIANG ZHANG, Haibin Ling, Weiming Hu","Bird's-eye-view (BEV) map layout estimation requires an accurate and full understanding of the semantics for the environmental elements around the ego car to make the results coherent and realistic. Due to the challenges posed by occlusion, unfavourable imaging conditions and low resolution, \emph{generating} the BEV semantic maps corresponding to corrupted or invalid areas in the perspective view (PV) is appealing very recently. \emph{The question is how to align the PV features with the generative models to facilitate the map estimation}. In this paper, we propose to utilize a generative model similar to the Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) to acquire prior knowledge for the high-level BEV semantics in the tokenized discrete space. Thanks to the obtained BEV tokens accompanied with a codebook embedding encapsulating the semantics for different BEV elements in the groundtruth maps, we are able to directly align the sparse backbone image features with the obtained BEV tokens from the discrete representation learning based on a specialized token decoder module, and finally generate high-quality BEV maps with the BEV codebook embedding serving as a bridge between PV and BEV. We evaluate the BEV map layout estimation performance of our model, termed VQ-Map, on both the nuScenes and Argoverse benchmarks, achieving 62.2/47.6 mean IoU for surround-view/monocular evaluation on nuScenes, as well as 73.4 IoU for monocular evaluation on Argoverse, which all set a new record for this map layout estimation task. The code and models are available on \url{https://github.com/Z1zyw/VQ-Map}."
Poster,Vript: A Video Is Worth Thousands of Words,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97868,"Dongjie Yang, Suyuan Huang, Chengqiang Lu, Xiaodong Han, Haoxin Zhang, Yan Gao, Yao Hu, Hai Zhao","Advancements in multimodal learning, particularly in video understanding and generation, require high-quality video-text datasets for improved model performance. Vript addresses this issue with a meticulously annotated corpus of 12K high-resolution videos, offering detailed, dense, and script-like captions for over 420K clips. Each clip has a caption of ~145 words, which is over 10x longer than most video-text datasets. Unlike captions only documenting static content in previous datasets, we enhance video captioning to video scripting by documenting not just the content, but also the camera operations, which include the shot types (medium shot, close-up, etc) and camera movements (panning, tilting, etc). By utilizing the Vript, we explore three training paradigms of aligning more text with the video modality rather than clip-caption pairs. This results in Vriptor, a top-performing video captioning model among open-source models, comparable to GPT-4V in performance. Vriptor is also a powerful model capable of end-to-end generation of dense and detailed captions for long videos. Moreover, we introduce Vript-Hard, a benchmark consisting of three video understanding tasks that are more challenging than existing benchmarks: Vript-HAL is the first benchmark evaluating action and object hallucinations in video LLMs, Vript-RR combines reasoning with retrieval resolving question ambiguity in long-video QAs, and Vript-ERO is a new task to evaluate the temporal understanding of events in long videos rather than actions in short videos in previous works. All code, models, and datasets are available in https://github.com/mutonix/Vript."
Poster,VRSBench: A Versatile Vision-Language Benchmark Dataset for Remote Sensing Image Understanding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97530,"Xiang Li, Jian Ding, Mohamed Elhoseiny","We introduce a new benchmark designed to advance the development of general-purpose, large-scale vision-language models for remote sensing images. Although several vision-language datasets in remote sensing have been proposed to pursue this goal, existing datasets are typically tailored to single tasks, lack detailed object information, or suffer from inadequate quality control. Exploring these improvement opportunities, we present a Versatile vision-language Benchmark for Remote Sensing image understanding, termed VRSBench. This benchmark comprises 29,614 images, with 29,614 human-verified detailed captions, 52,472 object references, and 123,221 question-answer pairs. It facilitates the training and evaluation of vision-language models across a broad spectrum of remote sensing image understanding tasks. We further evaluated state-of-the-art models on this benchmark for three vision-language tasks: image captioning, visual grounding, and visual question answering. Our work aims to significantly contribute to the development of advanced vision-language models in the field of remote sensing. The data and code can be accessed at https://vrsbench.github.io."
Poster,WAGLE: Strategic Weight Attribution for Effective and Modular Unlearning in Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94863,"Jinghan Jia, Jiancheng Liu, Yihua Zhang, Parikshit Ram, Nathalie Baracaldo, Sijia Liu","The need for effective unlearning mechanisms in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly urgent, driven by the necessity to adhere to data regulations and foster ethical generative AI practices. LLM unlearning is designed to reduce the impact of undesirable data influences and associated model capabilities without diminishing the utility of the model if unrelated to the information being forgotten. Despite growing interest, much of the existing research has focused on varied unlearning method designs to boost effectiveness and efficiency. However, the inherent relationship between model weights and LLM unlearning has not been extensively examined. In this paper, we systematically explore how model weights interact with unlearning processes in LLMs and we design the weight attribution-guided LLM unlearning method, WAGLE, which unveils the interconnections between 'influence' of weights and 'influence' of data to forget and retain in LLM generation. By strategically guiding the LLM unlearning across different types of unlearning methods and tasks, WAGLE can erase the undesired content, while maintaining the performance of the original tasks. We refer to the weight attribution-guided LLM unlearning method as WAGLE, which unveils the interconnections between 'influence' of weights and 'influence' of data to forget and retain in LLM generation. Our extensive experiments show that WAGLE boosts unlearning performance across a range of LLM unlearning methods such as gradient difference and (negative) preference optimization, applications such as fictitious unlearning (TOFU benchmark), malicious use prevention (WMDP benchmark), and copyrighted information removal, and models including Zephyr-7b-beta and Llama2-7b. To the best of our knowledge, our work offers the first principled method for attributing and pinpointing the influential weights in enhancing LLM unlearning. It stands in contrast to previous methods that lack weight attribution and simpler weight attribution techniques."
Poster,Warm-starting Push-Relabel,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94691,"Sami Davies, Sergei Vassilvitskii, Yuyan Wang","Push-Relabel is one of the most celebrated network flow algorithms. Maintaining a pre-flow that saturates a cut, it enjoys better theoretical and empirical running time than other flow algorithms, such as Ford-Fulkerson. In practice, Push-Relabel is even faster than what theoretical guarantees can promise, in part because of the use of good heuristics for seeding and updating the iterative algorithm. However, it remains unclear how to run Push-Relabel on an arbitrary initialization that is not necessarily a pre-flow or cut-saturating. We provide the first theoretical guarantees for warm-starting Push-Relabel with a predicted flow, where our learning-augmented version benefits from fast running time when the predicted flow is close to an optimal flow, while maintaining robust worst-case guarantees. Interestingly, our algorithm uses the gap relabeling heuristic, which has long been employed in practice, even though prior to our work there was no rigorous theoretical justification for why it can lead to run-time improvements. We then show our algorithmic framework works well in practice, as our warm-start version of Push-Relabel improves over the cold-start version by a larger and larger percentage as the size of the image increases."
Poster,Warm-up Free Policy Optimization: Improved Regret in Linear Markov Decision Processes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96860,"Asaf Cassel, Aviv Rosenberg","Policy Optimization (PO) methods are among the most popular Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms in practice. Recently, Sherman et al. [2023a] proposed a PO-based algorithm with rate-optimal regret guarantees under the linear Markov Decision Process (MDP) model. However, their algorithm relies on a costly pure exploration warm-up phase that is hard to implement in practice. This paper eliminates this undesired warm-up phase, replacing it with a simple and efficient contraction mechanism. Our PO algorithm achieves rate-optimal regret with improved dependence on the other parameters of the problem (horizon and function approximation dimension) in two fundamental settings: adversarial losses with full-information feedback and stochastic losses with bandit feedback."
Poster,Warped Diffusion: Solving Video Inverse Problems with Image Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95607,"Giannis Daras, Weili Nie, Karsten Kreis, Alex Dimakis, Morteza Mardani, Nikola Kovachki, Arash Vahdat","Using image models naively for solving inverse video problems often suffers from flickering, texture-sticking, and temporal inconsistency in generated videos. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we view frames as continuous functions in the 2D space, and videos as a sequence of continuous warping transformations between different frames. This perspective allows us to train function space diffusion models only on **images** and utilize them to solve temporally correlated inverse problems. The function space diffusion models need to be equivariant with respect to the underlying spatial transformations. To ensure temporal consistency, we introduce a simple post-hoc test-time guidance towards (self)-equivariant solutions. Our method allows us to deploy state-of-the-art latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion XL to solve video inverse problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for video inpainting and $8\times$ video super-resolution, outperforming existing techniques based on noise transformations. We provide generated video results in the following URL: https://giannisdaras.github.io/warped_diffusion.github.io/."
Poster,Wasserstein convergence of Cech persistence diagrams for samplings of submanifolds,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94624,"Charles Arnal, David Cohen-Steiner, Vincent Divol","Cech Persistence diagrams (PDs) are topological descriptors routinely used to capture the geometry of complex datasets. They are commonly compared using the Wasserstein distances $\mathrm{OT}_p$; however, the extent to which PDs are stable with respect to these metrics remains poorly understood. We partially close this gap by focusing on the case where datasets are sampled on an $m$-dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^d$. Under this manifold hypothesis, we show that convergence with respect to the $\mathrm{OT}_p$ metric happens exactly when $p>m$. We also provide improvements upon the bottleneck stability theorem in this case and prove new laws of large numbers for the total $\alpha$-persistence of PDs. Finally, we show how these theoretical findings shed new light on the behavior of the feature maps on the space of PDs that are used in ML-oriented applications of Topological Data Analysis."
Poster,Wasserstein Distance Rivals Kullback-Leibler Divergence for Knowledge Distillation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96847,"Jiaming Lv, Haoyuan Yang, Peihua Li","Since pioneering work of Hinton et al., knowledge distillation based on Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KL-Div) has been  predominant, and recently its variants have achieved compelling performance.  However, KL-Div  only compares probabilities of the corresponding category between the teacher and student while lacking a mechanism for cross-category comparison.  Besides, KL-Div is problematic when applied to intermediate layers, as it cannot handle non-overlapping distributions and is unaware of geometry of the underlying manifold. To address these downsides, we propose a methodology of Wasserstein Distance (WD) based knowledge distillation. Specifically, we propose  a logit distillation method called WKD-L based on discrete WD, which performs cross-category comparison of  probabilities and thus can explicitly leverage  rich interrelations among categories.  Moreover, we introduce a feature distillation method called WKD-F, which  uses a parametric method for modeling feature distributions and adopts continuous WD  for transferring knowledge from  intermediate layers. Comprehensive evaluations on image classification and object detection  have shown  (1) for logit distillation WKD-L outperforms very strong KL-Div variants; (2) for feature distillation WKD-F is superior to the KL-Div counterparts and state-of-the-art competitors."
Poster,Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization through the Lens of Structural Causal Models and Individual Fairness,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93536,"Ahmad-Reza Ehyaei, Golnoosh Farnadi, Samira Samadi","In recent years, Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has garnered substantial interest for its efficacy in data-driven decision-making under distributional uncertainty. However, limited research has explored the application of DRO to address individual fairness concerns, particularly when considering causal structures and discrete sensitive attributes in learning problems.To address this gap, we first formulate the DRO problem from the perspectives of causality and individual fairness. We then present the DRO dual formulation as an efficient tool to convert the main problem into a more tractable and computationally efficient form. Next, we characterize the closed form of the approximate worst-case loss quantity as a regularizer, eliminating the max-step in the Min-Max DRO problem. We further estimate the regularizer in more general cases and explore the relationship between DRO and classical robust optimization. Finally, by removing the assumption of a known structural causal model, we provide finite sample error bounds when designing DRO with empirical distributions and estimated causal structures to ensure efficiency and robust learning."
