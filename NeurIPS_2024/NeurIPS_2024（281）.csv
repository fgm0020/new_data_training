Poster,Normalization and effective learning rates in reinforcement learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94626,"Clare Lyle, Zeyu Zheng, Khimya Khetarpal, James Martens, Hado van Hasselt, Razvan Pascanu, Will Dabney","Normalization layers have recently experienced a renaissance in the deep reinforcement learning and continual learning literature, with several works highlighting diverse benefits such as improving loss landscape conditioning and combatting overestimation bias. However, normalization brings with it a subtle but important side effect: an equivalence between growth in the norm of the network parameters and decay in the effective learning rate. This becomes problematic in continual learning settings, where the resulting learning rate schedule may decay to near zero too quickly relative to the timescale of the learning problem. We propose to make the learning rate schedule explicit with a simple re-parameterization which we call  Normalize-and-Project (NaP), which couples the insertion of normalization layers with weight projection, ensuring that the effective learning rate remains constant throughout training. This technique reveals itself as a powerful analytical tool to better understand learning rate schedules in deep reinforcement learning, and as a means of improving robustness to nonstationarity in synthetic plasticity loss benchmarks along with both the single-task and sequential variants of the Arcade Learning Environment. We also show that our approach can be easily applied to popular architectures such as ResNets and transformers while recovering and in some cases even slightly improving the performance of the base model in common stationary benchmarks."
Poster,Normalization Layer Per-Example Gradients are Sufficient to Predict Gradient Noise Scale in Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95128,"Gavia Gray, aman tiwari, Shane Bergsma, Joel Hestness","Per-example gradient norms are a vital ingredient for estimating gradient noise scale (GNS) with minimal variance. Observing the tensor contractions required to compute them, we propose a method with minimal FLOPs in 3D or greater tensor regimes by simultaneously computing the norms while computing the parameter gradients. Using this method we are able to observe the GNS of different layers at higher accuracy than previously possible. We find that the total GNS of contemporary transformer models is predicted well by the GNS of only the normalization layers. As a result, focusing only on the normalization layer, we develop a custom kernel to compute the per-example gradient norms while performing the LayerNorm backward pass with zero throughput overhead. Tracking GNS on only those layers, we are able to guide a practical batch size schedule that reduces training time by 18% on a Chinchilla-optimal language model."
Poster,Not All Diffusion Model Activations Have Been Evaluated as Discriminative Features,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96411,"Benyuan Meng, Qianqian Xu, Zitai Wang, Xiaochun Cao, Qingming Huang","Diffusion models are initially designed for image generation. Recent research shows that the internal signals within their backbones, named activations, can also serve as dense features for various discriminative tasks such as semantic segmentation. Given numerous activations, selecting a small yet effective subset poses a fundamental problem. To this end, the early study of this field performs a large-scale quantitative comparison of the discriminative ability of the activations. However, we find that many potential activations have not been evaluated, such as the queries and keys used to compute attention scores. Moreover, recent advancements in diffusion architectures bring many new activations, such as those within embedded ViT modules. Both combined, activation selection remains unresolved but overlooked. To tackle this issue, this paper takes a further step with a much broader range of activations evaluated. Considering the significant increase in activations, a full-scale quantitative comparison is no longer operational. Instead, we seek to understand the properties of these activations, such that the activations that are clearly inferior can be filtered out in advance via simple qualitative evaluation. After careful analysis, we discover three properties universal among diffusion models, enabling this study to go beyond specific models. On top of this, we present effective feature selection solutions for several popular diffusion models. Finally, the experiments across multiple discriminative tasks validate the superiority of our method over the SOTA competitors.

Poster,Not All Tokens Are What You Need for Pretraining,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96931,"Zhenghao Lin, Zhibin Gou, Yeyun Gong, Xiao Liu, yelong shen, Ruochen Xu, Chen Lin, Yujiu Yang, Jian Jiao, Nan Duan, Weizhu Chen","Previous language model pre-training methods have uniformly applied a next-token prediction loss to all training tokens. Challenging this norm, we posit that ''Not all tokens in a corpus are equally important for language model training''. Our initial analysis examines token-level training dynamics of language model, revealing distinct loss patterns for different tokens. Leveraging these insights, we introduce a new language model called Rho-1. Unlike traditional LMs that learn to predict every next token in a corpus, Rho-1 employs Selective Language Modeling (SLM), which selectively trains on useful tokens that aligned with the desired distribution. This approach involves scoring training tokens using a reference model, and then training the language model with a focused loss on tokens with higher scores. When continual continual pretraining on 15B OpenWebMath corpus, Rho-1 yields an absolute improvement in few-shot accuracy of up to 30% in 9 math tasks. After fine-tuning, Rho-1-1B and 7B achieved state-of-the-art results of 40.6% and 51.8% on MATH dataset, respectively - matching DeepSeekMath with only 3% of the pretraining tokens. Furthermore, when continual pretraining on 80B general tokens, Rho-1 achieves 6.8% average enhancement across 15 diverse tasks, increasing both data efficiency and performance of the language model pre-training."
Poster,"Not Just Object, But State: Compositional Incremental Learning without Forgetting",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96823,"Yanyi Zhang, Binglin Qiu, Qi Jia, Yu Liu, Ran He","Most incremental learners excessively prioritize object classes while neglecting various kinds of states (e.g. color and material) attached to the objects. As a result, they are limited in the ability to model state-object compositionality accurately. To remedy this limitation, we propose a novel task called Compositional Incremental Learning (composition-IL), which enables the model to recognize a variety of state-object compositions in an incremental learning fashion. Since the lack of suitable datasets, we re-organize two existing datasets and make them tailored for composition-IL. Then, we propose a prompt-based Composition Incremental Learner (CompILer), to overcome the ambiguous composition boundary. Specifically, we exploit multi-pool prompt learning, and ensure the inter-pool prompt discrepancy and intra-pool prompt diversity. Besides, we devise object-injected state prompting which injects object prompts to guide the selection of state prompts. Furthermore, we fuse the selected prompts by a generalized-mean strategy, to eliminate irrelevant information learned in the prompts. Extensive experiments on two datasets exhibit state-of-the-art performance achieved by CompILer. Code and datasets are available at: https://github.com/Yanyi-Zhang/CompILer."
Poster,"No Train, all Gain: Self-Supervised Gradients Improve Deep Frozen Representations",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95313,"Walter Simoncini, Andrei Bursuc, Spyridon Gidaris, Yuki Asano","This paper introduces FUNGI, **F**eatures from **UN**supervised **G**rad**I**ents, a method to enhance the features of transformer encoders by leveraging self-supervised gradients. Our method is simple: given any pretrained model, we first compute gradients from various self-supervised objectives for each input. These gradients are projected to a lower dimension and then concatenated with the model's output embedding. The resulting features are evaluated on k-nearest neighbor classification over 11 datasets from vision, 5 from natural language processing, and 2 from audio. Across backbones spanning various sizes and pretraining strategies, FUNGI features provide consistent performance improvements over the embeddings. We also show that using FUNGI features can benefit linear classification, clustering and image retrieval, and that they significantly improve the retrieval-based in-context scene understanding abilities of pretrained models, for example improving upon DINO by +17% for semantic segmentation - without any training.

Poster,Not so griddy: Internal representations of RNNs path integrating more than one agent,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94311,"William Redman, Francisco Acosta, Santiago Acosta-Mendoza, Nina Miolane","Success in collaborative and competitive environments, where agents must work with or against each other, requires individuals to encode the position and trajectory of themselves and others. Decades of neurophysiological experiments have shed light on how brain regions [e.g., medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), hippocampus] encode the self's position and trajectory. However, it has only recently been discovered that MEC and hippocampus are modulated by the positions and trajectories of others. To understand how encoding spatial information of multiple agents shapes neural representations, we train a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that captures properties of MEC to path integrate trajectories of two agents simultaneously navigating the same environment. We find significant differences between these RNNs and those trained to path integrate only a single agent. At the individual unit level, RNNs trained to path integrate more than one agent develop weaker grid responses, stronger border responses, and tuning for the relative position of the two agents. At the population level, they develop more distributed and robust representations, with changes in network dynamics and manifold topology. Our results provide testable predictions and open new directions with which to study the neural computations supporting spatial navigation."
Poster,Novel Object Synthesis via Adaptive Text-Image Harmony,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96036,"Zeren Xiong, Zedong Zhang, Zikun Chen, Shuo Chen, Xiang Li, Gan Sun, Jian Yang, Jun Li","In this paper, we study an object synthesis task that combines an object text with an object image to create a new object image. However, most diffusion models struggle with this task, \textit{i.e.}, often generating an object that predominantly reflects either the text or the image due to an imbalance between their inputs. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method called Adaptive Text-Image Harmony (ATIH) to generate novel and surprising objects.First, we introduce a scale factor and an injection step to balance text and image features in cross-attention and to preserve image information in self-attention during the text-image inversion diffusion process, respectively. Second, to better integrate object text and image, we design a balanced loss function with a noise parameter, ensuring both optimal editability and fidelity of the object image. Third, to adaptively adjust these parameters, we present a novel similarity score function that not only maximizes the similarities between the generated object image and the input text/image but also balances these similarities to harmonize text and image integration.  Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing remarkable object creations such as colobus-glass jar. https://xzr52.github.io/ATIH/"
Poster,NovoBench: Benchmarking Deep Learning-based \emph{De Novo} Sequencing Methods in Proteomics,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97686,"Jingbo Zhou, Shaorong Chen, Jun Xia, Sizhe Liu, Tianze Ling, Wenjie Du, Yue Liu, Jianwei Yin, Stan Z. Li","Tandem mass spectrometry has played a pivotal role in advancing proteomics, enabling the analysis of protein composition in biological tissues. Many deep learning methods have been developed for \emph{de novo} peptide sequencing task, i.e., predicting the peptide sequence for the observed mass spectrum. However, two key challenges seriously hinder the further research of this important task. Firstly, since there is no consensus for the evaluation datasets, the empirical results in different research papers are often not comparable, leading to unfair comparison. Secondly, the current methods are usually limited to amino acid-level or peptide-level precision and recall metrics. In this work, we present the first unified benchmark NovoBench for \emph{de novo} peptide sequencing, which comprises diverse mass spectrum data, integrated models, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. Recent impressive methods, including DeepNovo, PointNovo, Casanovo, InstaNovo, AdaNovo and $\pi$-HelixNovo are integrated into our framework. In addition to amino acid-level and peptide-level precision and recall, we also evaluate the models' performance in terms of identifying post-tranlational modifications (PTMs), efficiency and robustness to peptide length, noise peaks and missing fragment ratio, which are important influencing factors while seldom be considered. Leveraging this benchmark, we conduct a large-scale study of current methods, report many insightful findings that open up new possibilities for future development. The benchmark is open-sourced to facilitate future research and application. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Westlake-OmicsAI/NovoBench}."
Poster,"No ""Zero-Shot"" Without Exponential Data: Pretraining Concept Frequency Determines Multimodal Model Performance",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96307,"Vishaal Udandarao, Ameya Prabhu, Adhiraj Ghosh, Yash Sharma, Philip Torr, Adel Bibi, Samuel Albanie, Matthias Bethge","Web-crawled pretraining datasets underlie the impressive ""zero-shot"" evaluation performance of multimodal models, such as CLIP for classification and Stable-Diffusion for image generation. However, it is unclear how meaningful the notion of ""zero-shot"" generalization is for such multimodal models, as it is not known to what extent their pretraining datasets encompass the downstream concepts targeted for during ""zero-shot"" evaluation. In this work, we ask: How is the performance of multimodal models on downstream concepts influenced by the frequency of these concepts in their pretraining datasets?We comprehensively investigate this question across 34 models and 5 standard pretraining datasets (CC-3M, CC-12M, YFCC-15M, LAION-400M, LAION-Aesthetics), generating over 300GB of data artifacts. We consistently find that, far from exhibiting ""zero-shot"" generalization, multimodal models require exponentially more data to achieve linear improvements in downstream ""zero-shot"" performance, following a sample inefficient log-linear scaling trend. This trend persists even when controlling for sample-level similarity between pretraining and downstream datasets, and testing on purely synthetic data distributions. Furthermore, upon benchmarking models on long-tailed data sampled based on our analysis, we demonstrate that multimodal models across the board perform poorly. We contribute this long-tail test set as the Let it Wag! benchmark to further research in this direction. Taken together, our study reveals an exponential need for training data which implies that the key to ""zero-shot"" generalization capabilities under large-scale training data and compute paradigms remains to be found."
