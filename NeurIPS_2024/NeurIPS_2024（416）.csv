Poster,TrAct: Making First-layer Pre-Activations Trainable,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94159,"Felix Petersen, Christian Borgelt, Stefano Ermon","We consider the training of the first layer of vision models and notice the clear relationship between pixel values and gradient update magnitudes: the gradients arriving at the weights of a first layer are by definition directly proportional to (normalized) input pixel values. Thus, an image with low contrast has a smaller impact on learning than an image with higher contrast, and a very bright or very dark image has a stronger impact on the weights than an image with moderate brightness. In this work, we propose performing gradient descent on the embeddings produced by the first layer of the model. However, switching to discrete inputs with an embedding layer is not a reasonable option for vision models. Thus, we propose the conceptual procedure of (i) a gradient descent step on first layer activations to construct an activation proposal, and (ii) finding the optimal weights of the first layer, i.e., those weights which minimize the squared distance to the activation proposal. We provide a  closed form solution of the procedure and adjust it for robust stochastic training while computing everything efficiently. Empirically, we find that TrAct (Training Activations) speeds up training by factors between 1.25x and 4x while requiring only a small computational overhead. We demonstrate the utility of TrAct with different optimizers for a range of different vision models including convolutional and transformer architectures."
Poster,Trade-Offs of Diagonal Fisher Information Matrix Estimators,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95032,"Alexander Soen, Ke Sun","The Fisher information matrix can be used to characterize the local geometry ofthe parameter space of neural networks. It elucidates insightful theories anduseful tools to understand and optimize neural networks. Given its highcomputational cost, practitioners often use random estimators and evaluate onlythe diagonal entries. We examine two popular estimators whose accuracy and samplecomplexity depend on their associated variances. We derive bounds of thevariances and instantiate them in neural networks for regression andclassification. We navigate trade-offs for both estimators based on analyticaland numerical studies. We find that the variance quantities depend on thenon-linearity w.r.t. different parameter groups and should not be neglected whenestimating the Fisher information."
Poster,Trading off Consistency and Dimensionality of Convex Surrogates for Multiclass Classification,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93098,"Enrique Nueve, Dhamma Kimpara, Bo Waggoner, Jessica Finocchiaro","In multiclass classification over $n$ outcomes, we typically optimize some surrogate loss $L: \mathbb{R}^d \times\mathcal{Y} \to \mathbb{R}$ assigning real-valued error to predictions in $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this paradigm, outcomes must be embedded into the reals with dimension $d \approx n$ in order to design a consistent surrogate loss. Consistent losses are well-motivated theoretically, yet for large $n$, such as in information retrieval and structured prediction tasks, their optimization may be computationally infeasible. In practice, outcomes are typically embedded into some $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d \ll n$, with little known about their suitability for multiclass classification. We investigate two approaches for trading off consistency and dimensionality in multiclass classification while using a convex surrogate loss. We first formalize partial consistency when the optimized surrogate has dimension $d \ll n$. We then check if partial consistency holds under a given embedding and low-noise assumption, providing insight into when to use a particular embedding into $\mathbb{R}^d$. Finally, we present a new method to construct (fully) consistent losses with $d \ll n$ out of multiple problem instances. Our practical approach leverages parallelism to sidestep lower bounds on $d$."
Poster,Trading Place for Space: Increasing Location Resolution Reduces Contextual Capacity in Hippocampal Codes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95187,"Spencer Rooke, Zhaoze Wang, Ronald Di Tullio, Vijay Balasubramanian","Many animals learn cognitive maps of their environment - a simultaneous representation of context, experience, and position.  Place cells in the hippocampus, named for their explicit encoding of position, are believed to be a neural substrate of these maps, with place cell ""remapping"" explaining how this system can represent different contexts. Briefly, place cells alter their firing properties, or ""remap"", in response to changes in experiential or sensory cues. Substantial sensory changes, produced, e.g., by moving between environments, cause large subpopulations of place cells to change their tuning entirely. While many studies have looked at the physiological basis of remapping, we lack explicit calculations of how the contextual capacity of the place cell system changes as a function of place field firing properties. Here, we propose a geometric approach to understanding population level activity of place cells.  Using known firing field statistics, we investigate how changes to place cell firing properties affect the distances between representations of different environments within firing rate space.  Using this approach, we find that the number of contexts storable by the hippocampus grows exponentially with the number of place cells, and calculate this exponent for environments of different sizes. We identify a fundamental trade-off between high resolution encoding of position and the number of storable contexts. This trade-off is tuned by place cell width, which might explain the change in firing field scale along the dorsal-ventral axis of the hippocampus. We demonstrate that clustering of place cells near likely points of confusion, such as boundaries, increases the contextual capacity of the place system within our framework and conclude by discussing how our geometric approach could be extended to include other cell types and abstract spaces."
Poster,Train-Attention: Meta-Learning Where to Focus in Continual Knowledge Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93521,"Seo Yeongbin, Dongha Lee, Jinyoung Yeo","Previous studies on continual knowledge learning (CKL) in large language models (LLMs) have predominantly focused on approaches such as regularization, architectural modifications, and rehearsal techniques to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, these methods naively inherit the inefficiencies of standard training procedures, indiscriminately applying uniform weight across all tokens, which can lead to unnecessary parameter updates and increased forgetting. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel CKL approach termed Train-Attention-Augmented Language Model (TAALM), which enhances learning efficiency by dynamically predicting and applying weights to tokens based on their usefulness. This method employs a meta-learning framework that optimizes token importance predictions, facilitating targeted knowledge updates and minimizing forgetting. Also, we observe that existing benchmarks do not clearly exhibit the trade-off between learning and retaining, therefore we propose a new benchmark, LAMA-ckl, to address this issue. Through experiments conducted on both newly introduced and established CKL benchmarks, TAALM proves the state-of-the-art performance upon the baselines, and also shows synergistic compatibility when integrated with previous CKL approaches. The code and the dataset are available online."
Poster,Training an Open-Vocabulary Monocular 3D Detection Model without 3D Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96048,"Rui Huang, Henry Zheng, Yan Wang, Zhuofan Xia, Marco Pavone, Gao Huang","Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has recently attracted considerable attention due to its broad applications in autonomous driving and robotics, which aims to effectively recognize novel classes in previously unseen domains. However, existing point cloud-based open-vocabulary 3D detection models are limited by their high deployment costs. In this work, we propose a novel open-vocabulary monocular 3D object detection framework, dubbed OVM3D-Det, which trains detectors using only RGB images, making it both cost-effective and scalable to publicly available data. Unlike traditional methods, OVM3D-Det does not require high-precision LiDAR or 3D sensor data for either input or generating 3D bounding boxes. Instead, it employs open-vocabulary 2D models and pseudo-LiDAR to automatically label 3D objects in RGB images, fostering the learning of open-vocabulary monocular 3D detectors. However, training 3D models with labels directly derived from pseudo-LiDAR is inadequate due to imprecise boxes estimated from noisy point clouds and severely occluded objects. To address these issues, we introduce two innovative designs: adaptive pseudo-LiDAR erosion and bounding box refinement with prior knowledge from large language models. These techniques effectively calibrate the 3D labels and enable RGB-only training for 3D detectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of OVM3D-Det over baselines in both indoor and outdoor scenarios. The code will be released."
Poster,Training Binary Neural Networks via Gaussian Variational Inference and Low-Rank Semidefinite Programming,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94427,"Lorenzo Orecchia, Jiawei Hu, Xue He, Wang Mark, Xulei Yang, Min Wu, Xue Geng","Current methods for training Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) heavily rely on the heuristic straight-through estimator (STE), which crucially enables the application of SGD-based optimizers to the combinatorial training problem. Although the STE heuristics and their variants have led to significant improvements in BNN performance, their theoretical underpinnings remain unclear and relatively understudied. In this paper, we propose a theoretically motivated optimization framework for BNN training based on Gaussian variational inference. In its simplest form, our approach yields a non-convex linear programming formulation whose variables and associated gradients motivate the use of latent weights and STE gradients. More importantly, our framework allows us to  formulate  semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations to the BNN training task. Such formulations are able to explicitly models pairwise correlations between weights during training, leading to a more accurate optimization characterization of the training problem. As the size of such formulations grows quadratically in the number of weights, quickly becoming intractable for large networks, we apply the Burer-Monteiro approach and only optimize over linear-size low-rank SDP solutions. Our empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet datasets shows our method consistently outperforming all state-of-the-art algorithms for training BNNs."
Poster,Training Compute-Optimal Protein Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93287,"Xingyi Cheng, Bo Chen, Pan Li, Jing Gong, Jie Tang, Le Song","We explore optimally training protein language models, an area of significant interest in biological research where guidance on best practices is limited.Most models are trained with extensive compute resources until performance gains plateau, focusing primarily on increasing model sizes rather than optimizing the efficient compute frontier that balances performance and compute budgets.Our investigation is grounded in a massive dataset consisting of 939 million protein sequences. We trained over 300 models ranging from 3.5 million to 10.7 billion parameters on 5 to 200 billion unique tokens, to investigate the relations between model sizes, training token numbers, and objectives.First, we observed the effect of diminishing returns for the Causal Language Model (CLM) and that of overfitting for Masked Language Model (MLM) when repeating the commonly used Uniref database. To address this, we included metagenomic protein sequences in the training set to increase the diversity and avoid the plateau or overfitting effects. Second, we obtained the scaling laws of CLM and MLM on Transformer, tailored to the specific characteristics of protein sequence data. Third, we observe a transfer scaling phenomenon from CLM to MLM, further demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer through scaling behaviors based on estimated Effectively Transferred Tokens.Finally, to validate our scaling laws, we compare the large-scale versions of ESM-2 and PROGEN2 on downstream tasks, encompassing evaluations of protein generation as well as structure- and function-related tasks, all within less or equivalent pre-training compute budgets."
Poster,Training Data Attribution via Approximate Unrolling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96749,"Juhan Bae, Wu Lin, Jonathan Lorraine, Roger Grosse","Many training data attribution (TDA) methods aim to estimate how a model's behavior would change if one or more data points were removed from the training set. Methods based on implicit differentiation, such as influence functions, can be made computationally efficient, but fail to account for underspecification, the implicit bias of the optimization algorithm, or multi-stage training pipelines. By contrast, methods based on unrolling address these issues but face scalability challenges. In this work, we connect the implicit-differentiation-based and unrolling-based approaches and combine their benefits by introducing Source, an approximate unrolling-based TDA method that is computed using an influence-function-like formula. While being computationally efficient compared to unrolling-based approaches, Source is suitable in cases where implicit-differentiation-based approaches struggle, such as in non-converged models and multi-stage training pipelines. Empirically, Source outperforms existing TDA techniques in counterfactual prediction, especially in settings where implicit-differentiation-based approaches fall short."
Poster,Training Dynamics of Transformers to Recognize Word Co-occurrence via Gradient Flow Analysis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93173,"Hongru Yang, Bhavya Kailkhura, Zhangyang &quot;Atlas&quot; Wang, Yingbin Liang","Understanding the training dynamics of transformers is important to explain the impressive capabilities behind large language models. In this work, we study the dynamics of training a shallow transformer on a task of recognizing co-occurrence of two designated words. In the literature of studying training dynamics of transformers, several simplifications are commonly adopted such as weight reparameterization, attention linearization, special initialization, and lazy regime. In contrast, we analyze the gradient flow dynamics of simultaneously training three attention matrices and a linear MLP layer from random initialization, and provide a framework of analyzing such dynamics via a coupled dynamical system. We establish near minimum loss and characterize the attention model after training. We discover that gradient flow serves as an inherent mechanism that naturally divide the training process into two phases. In Phase 1, the linear MLP quickly aligns with the two target signals for correct classification, whereas the softmax attention remains almost unchanged. In Phase 2, the attention matrices and the MLP evolve jointly to enlarge the classification margin and reduce the loss to a near minimum value. Technically, we prove a novel property of the gradient flow, termed \textit{automatic balancing of gradients}, which enables the loss values of different samples to decrease almost at the same rate and further facilitates the proof of near minimum training loss. We also conduct experiments to verify our theoretical results."
