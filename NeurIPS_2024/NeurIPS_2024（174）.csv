Poster,Gradient-based Discrete Sampling with Automatic Cyclical Scheduling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96627,"Patrick Pynadath, Riddhiman Bhattacharya, ARUN HARIHARAN, Ruqi Zhang","Discrete distributions, particularly in high-dimensional deep models, are often highly multimodal due to inherent discontinuities. While gradient-based discrete sampling has proven effective, it is susceptible to becoming trapped in local modes due to the gradient information. To tackle this challenge, we propose an automatic cyclical scheduling, designed for efficient and accurate sampling in multimodal discrete distributions. Our method contains three key components: (1) a cyclical step size schedule where large steps discover new modes and small steps exploit each mode; (2) a cyclical balancing schedule, ensuring ""balanced"" proposals for given step sizes and high efficiency of the Markov chain; and (3) an automatic tuning scheme for adjusting the hyperparameters in the cyclical schedules, allowing adaptability across diverse datasets with minimal tuning.  We prove the non-asymptotic convergence and inference guarantee for our method in general discrete distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in sampling complex multimodal discrete distributions."
Poster,Gradient Cuff: Detecting Jailbreak Attacks on Large Language Models by Exploring Refusal Loss Landscapes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93211,"Xiaomeng Hu, Pin-Yu Chen, Tsung-Yi Ho","Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming a prominent generative AI tool, where the user enters a query and the LLM generates an answer. To reduce harm and misuse, efforts have been made to align these LLMs to human values using advanced training techniques such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of LLMs to adversarial jailbreak attempts aiming at subverting the embedded safety guardrails. To address this challenge, this paper defines and investigates the **Refusal Loss** of LLMs and then proposes a method called **Gradient Cuff** to detect jailbreak attempts. Gradient Cuff exploits the unique properties observed in the refusal loss landscape, including functional values and its smoothness, to design an effective two-step detection strategy. Experimental results on two aligned LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B-Chat and Vicuna-7B-V1.5) and six types of jailbreak attacks (GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR, TAP, Base64, and LRL) show that Gradient Cuff can significantly improve the LLM's rejection capability for malicious jailbreak queries, while maintaining the model's performance for benign user queries by adjusting the detection threshold."
Poster,Gradient-free Decoder Inversion in Latent Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93681,"Seongmin Hong, Suh Yoon Jeon, Kyeonghyun Lee, Ernest Ryu, Se Young Chun","In latent diffusion models (LDMs), denoising diffusion process efficiently takes place on latent space whose dimension is lower than that of pixel space. Decoder is typically used to transform the representation in latent space to that in pixel space. While a decoder is assumed to have an encoder as an accurate inverse, exact encoder-decoder pair rarely exists in practice even though applications often require precise inversion of decoder. In other words, encoder is not the left-inverse but the right-inverse of the decoder; decoder inversion seeks the left-inverse. Prior works for decoder inversion in LDMs employed gradient descent inspired by inversions of generative adversarial networks. However, gradient-based methods require larger GPU memory and longer computation time for larger latent space. For example, recent video LDMs can generate more than 16 frames, but GPUs with 24 GB memory can only perform gradient-based decoder inversion for 4 frames. Here, we propose an efficient gradient-free decoder inversion for LDMs, which can be applied to diverse latent models. Theoretical convergence property of our proposed inversion has been investigated not only for the forward step method, but also for the inertial Krasnoselskii-Mann (KM) iterations under mild assumption on cocoercivity that is satisfied by recent LDMs. Our proposed gradient-free method with Adam optimizer and learning rate scheduling significantly reduced computation time and memory usage over prior gradient-based methods and enabled efficient computation in applications such as noise-space watermarking and background-preserving image editing while achieving comparable error levels."
Poster,Gradient-Free Methods for Nonconvex Nonsmooth Stochastic Compositional Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94965,"Zhuanghua Liu, Luo Luo, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low","The stochastic compositional optimization (SCO) is popular in many real-world applications, including risk management, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning. However, most of the previous methods for SCO require the smoothness assumption on both the outer and inner functions, which limits their applications to a wider range of problems. In this paper, we study the SCO problem in that both the outer and inner functions are Lipschitz continuous but possibly nonconvex and nonsmooth. In particular, we propose gradient-free stochastic methods for finding the $(\delta, \epsilon)$-Goldstein stationary points of such problems with non-asymptotic convergence rates. Our results also lead to an improved convergence rate for the convex nonsmooth SCO problem. Furthermore, we conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods."
Poster,Gradient Guidance for Diffusion Models: An Optimization Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94799,"Yingqing Guo, Hui Yuan, Yukang Yang, Minshuo Chen, Mengdi Wang","Diffusion models have demonstrated empirical successes in various applications and can be adapted to task-specific needs via guidance. This paper studies a form of gradient guidance for adapting a pre-trained diffusion model towards optimizing user-specified objectives. We establish a mathematical framework for guided diffusion to systematically study its optimization theory and algorithmic design. Our theoretical analysis spots a strong link between guided diffusion models and optimization: gradient-guided diffusion models are essentially sampling solutions to a regularized optimization problem, where the regularization is imposed by the pre-training data. As for guidance design, directly bringing in the gradient of an external objective function as guidance would  jeopardize the structure in generated samples. We investigate a modified form of gradient guidance based on a forward prediction loss, which leverages the information in pre-trained score functions and provably preserves the latent structure. We further consider an iteratively fine-tuned version of gradient-guided diffusion where guidance and score network are both updated with newly generated samples. This process mimics a first-order optimization iteration in expectation, for which we proved $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/K)$ convergence rate to the global optimum when the objective function is concave.

Poster,Gradient Methods for Online DR-Submodular Maximization with Stochastic Long-Term Constraints,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95306,"Guanyu Nie, Vaneet Aggarwal, Christopher Quinn","In this paper, we consider the problem of online monotone DR-submodular maximization subject to long-term stochastic constraints. Specifically, at each round $t\in [T]$, after committing an action $\mathbf{x}_t$, a random reward $f_t(\mathbf{x}_t)$ and an unbiased gradient estimate of the point $\widetilde{\nabla}f_t(\mathbf{x}_t)$ (semi-bandit feedback) are revealed. Meanwhile, a budget of $g_t(\mathbf{x}_t)$, which is linear and stochastic, is consumed of its total allotted budget $B_T$. We propose a gradient ascent based algorithm that achieves $\frac{1}{2}$-regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ with $\mathcal{O}(T^{3/4})$ constraint violation with high probability. Moreover, when first-order full-information feedback is available, we propose an algorithm that achieves $(1-1/e)$-regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ with $\mathcal{O}(T^{3/4})$ constraint violation. These algorithms significantly improve over the state-of-the-art in terms of query complexity."
Poster,Gradient Rewiring for Editable Graph Neural Network Training,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94760,"Zhimeng Jiang, Zirui Liu, Xiaotian Han, Qizhang Feng, Hongye Jin, Qiaoyu Tan, Kaixiong Zhou, Na Zou, Xia Hu","Deep neural networks are ubiquitously adopted in many applications, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and graph analytics. However, well-trained neural networks can make prediction errors after deployment as the world changes. \textit{Model editing} involves updating the base model to correct prediction errors with less accessible training data and computational resources.Despite recent advances in model editors in computer vision and natural language processing, editable training in graph neural networks (GNNs) is rarely explored. The challenge with editable GNN training lies in the inherent information aggregation across neighbors, which can lead model editors to affect the predictions of other nodes unintentionally. In this paper, we first observe the gradient of cross-entropy loss for the target node and training nodes with significant inconsistency, which indicates that directly fine-tuning the base model using the loss on the target node deteriorates the performance on training nodes. Motivated by the gradient inconsistency observation, we propose a simple yet effective \underline{G}radient \underline{R}ewiring method for \underline{E}ditable graph neural network training, named \textbf{GRE}. Specifically, we first store the anchor gradient of the loss on training nodes to preserve the locality. Subsequently, we rewire the gradient of the loss on the target node to preserve performance on the training node using anchor gradient. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GRE on various model architectures and graph datasets in terms of multiple editing situations.

Poster,Gradients of Functions of Large Matrices,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95179,"Nicholas Krämer, Pablo Moreno-Muñoz, Hrittik Roy, Søren Hauberg","Tuning scientific and probabilistic machine learning models - for example, partial differential equations, Gaussian processes, or Bayesian neural networks - often relies on evaluating functions of matrices whose size grows with the data set or the number of parameters.While the state-of-the-art for _evaluating_ these quantities is almost always based on Lanczos and Arnoldi iterations, the present work is the first to explain how to _differentiate_ these workhorses of numerical linear algebra efficiently.To get there, we derive previously unknown adjoint systems for Lanczos and Arnoldi iterations, implement them in JAX, and show that the resulting code can compete with Diffrax when it comes to differentiating PDEs, GPyTorch for selecting Gaussian process models and beats standard factorisation methods for calibrating Bayesian neural networks.All this is achieved without any problem-specific code optimisation.Find the code at [link redacted] and install the library with *pip install [redacted]*."
Poster,Gradient-Variation Online Learning under Generalized Smoothness,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94921,"Yan-Feng Xie, Peng Zhao, Zhi-Hua Zhou","Gradient-variation online learning aims to achieve regret guarantees that scale with variations in the gradients of online functions, which is crucial for attaining fast convergence in games and robustness in stochastic optimization, hence receiving increased attention. Existing results often require the smoothness condition by imposing a fixed bound on gradient Lipschitzness, which may be unrealistic in practice. Recent efforts in neural network optimization suggest a generalized smoothness condition, allowing smoothness to correlate with gradient norms. In this paper, we systematically study gradient-variation online learning under generalized smoothness. We extend the classic optimistic mirror descent algorithm to derive gradient-variation regret by analyzing stability over the optimization trajectory and exploiting smoothness locally. Then, we explore universal online learning, designing a single algorithm with the optimal gradient-variation regrets for convex and strongly convex functions simultaneously, without requiring prior knowledge of curvature. This algorithm adopts a two-layer structure with a meta-algorithm running over a group of base-learners. To ensure favorable guarantees, we design a new Lipschitz-adaptive meta-algorithm, capable of handling potentially unbounded gradients while ensuring a second-order bound to effectively ensemble the base-learners. Finally, we provide the applications for fast-rate convergence in games and stochastic extended adversarial optimization."
Poster,Gradual Domain Adaptation via Manifold-Constrained Distributionally Robust Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94967,"seyed amir saberi, Amir Najafi, Amin Behjati, Ala Emrani, Yasaman Zolfimoselo, Shadrooy, Abolfazl Motahari, Babak Khalaj","The aim of this paper is to address the challenge of gradual domain adaptation within a class of manifold-constrained data distributions. In particular, we consider a sequence of $T\ge2$ data distributions $P_1,\ldots,P_T$ undergoing a gradual shift, where each pair of consecutive measures $P_i,P_{i+1}$ are close to each other in Wasserstein distance. We have a supervised dataset of size $n$ sampled from $P_0$, while for the subsequent distributions in the sequence, only unlabeled i.i.d. samples are available. Moreover, we assume that all distributions exhibit a known favorable attribute, such as (but not limited to) having intra-class soft/hard margins. In this context, we propose a methodology rooted in Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) with an adaptive Wasserstein radius. We theoretically show that this method guarantees the classification error across all $P_i$s can be suitably bounded. Our bounds rely on a newly introduced {\it {compatibility}} measure, which fully characterizes the error propagation dynamics along the sequence. Specifically, for inadequately constrained distributions, the error can exponentially escalate as we progress through the gradual shifts. Conversely, for appropriately constrained distributions, the error can be demonstrated to be linear or even entirely eradicated. We have substantiated our theoretical findings through several experimental results."
