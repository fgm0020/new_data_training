Poster,LCM: Locally Constrained Compact Point Cloud Model for Masked Point Modeling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95860,"Yaohua Zha, Naiqi Li, Yanzi Wang, Tao Dai, Hang Guo, Bin Chen, Zhi Wang, Zhihao Ouyang, Shu-Tao Xia","The pre-trained point cloud model based on Masked Point Modeling (MPM) has exhibited substantial improvements across various tasks. However, these models heavily rely on the Transformer, leading to quadratic complexity and limited decoder, hindering their practice application. To address this limitation, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of existing Transformer-based MPM, emphasizing the idea that redundancy reduction is crucial for point cloud analysis. To this end, we propose a Locally constrained Compact point cloud Model (LCM) consisting of a locally constrained compact encoder and a locally constrained Mamba-based decoder. Our encoder replaces self-attention with our local aggregation layers to achieve an elegant balance between performance and efficiency. Considering the varying information density between masked and unmasked patches in the decoder inputs of MPM, we introduce a locally constrained Mamba-based decoder. This decoder ensures linear complexity while maximizing the perception of point cloud geometry information from unmasked patches with higher information density. Extensive experimental results show that our compact model significantly surpasses existing Transformer-based models in both performance and efficiency, especially our LCM-based Point-MAE model, compared to the Transformer-based model, achieved an improvement of 1.84%, 0.67%, and 0.60% in performance on the three variants of ScanObjectNN while reducing parameters by 88% and computation by 73%.

Poster,Lean Workbook: A large-scale Lean problem set formalized from natural language math problems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97664,"Huaiyuan Ying, Zijian Wu, Yihan Geng, JIayu Wang, Dahua Lin, Kai Chen","Large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various natural language processing tasks, especially in solving mathematical problems. However, large language models are not good at math theorem proving using formal languages like Lean. A significant challenge in this area is the scarcity of training data available in these formal languages. To address this issue, we propose a novel pipeline that iteratively generates and filters synthetic data to translate natural language mathematical problems into Lean 4 statements, and vice versa. Our results indicate that the synthetic data pipeline can provide useful training data and improve the performance of LLMs in translating and understanding complex mathematical problems and proofs. Our final dataset contains about 57K formal-informal question pairs along with searched proof from the math contest forum and 21 new IMO questions. We open-source our code at \url{https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM-Math} and our data at \url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/InternLM/Lean-Workbook}."
Poster,Learnability Matters: Active Learning for Video Captioning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96680,"Yiqian Zhang, Buyu Liu, Jun Bao, Qiang Huang, Min Zhang, Jun Yu","This work focuses on the active learning in video captioning. In particular, we propose to address the learnability problem in active learning, which has been brought up by collective outliers in video captioning and neglected in the literature. To start with, we conduct a comprehensive study of collective outliers, exploring their hard-to-learn property and concluding that ground truth inconsistency is one of the main causes. Motivated by this, we design a novel active learning algorithm that takes three complementary aspects, namely learnability, diversity, and uncertainty, into account. Ideally, learnability is reflected by ground truth consistency. Under the active learning scenario where ground truths are not available until human involvement, we measure the consistency on estimated ground truths, where predictions from off-the-shelf models are utilized as approximations to ground truths. These predictions are further used to estimate sample frequency and reliability, evincing the diversity and uncertainty respectively. With the help of our novel caption-wise active learning protocol, our algorithm is capable of leveraging knowledge from humans in a more effective yet intellectual manner. Results on publicly available video captioning datasets with diverse video captioning models demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms SOTA active learning methods by a large margin, e.g. we achieve about 103% of full performance on CIDEr with 25% of human annotations on MSR-VTT."
Poster,Learnability of high-dimensional targets by two-parameter models and gradient flow,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96367,Dmitry Yarotsky,"We explore the theoretical possibility of learning $d$-dimensional targets with $W$-parameter models by gradient flow (GF) when $W<d$. Our main result shows that if the targets are described by a particular $d$-dimensional probability distribution, then there exist models with as few as two parameters that can learn the targets with arbitrarily high success probability. On the other hand, we show that for $W<d$ there is necessarily a large subset of GF-non-learnable targets. In particular, the set of learnable targets is not dense in $\mathbb R^d$, and any subset of $\mathbb R^d$ homeomorphic to the $W$-dimensional sphere contains non-learnable targets. Finally, we observe that the model in our main theorem on almost guaranteed two-parameter learning is constructed using a hierarchical procedure and as a result is not expressible by a single elementary function. We show that this limitation is essential in the sense that most models written in terms of elementary functions cannot achieve the learnability demonstrated in this theorem."
Poster,Learning 1D Causal Visual Representation with De-focus Attention Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95557,"Tao Chenxin, Xizhou Zhu, Shiqian Su, Lewei Lu, Changyao Tian, Xuan Luo, Gao Huang, Hongsheng Li, Yu Qiao, Jie Zhou, Jifeng Dai","Modality differences have led to the development of heterogeneous architectures for vision and language models. While images typically require 2D non-causal modeling, texts utilize 1D causal modeling. This distinction poses significant challenges in constructing unified multi-modal models. This paper explores the feasibility of representing images using 1D causal modeling. We identify an ""over-focus"" issue in existing 1D causal vision models, where attention overly concentrates on a small proportion of visual tokens. The issue of ""over-focus"" hinders the model's ability to extract diverse visual features and to receive effective gradients for optimization. To address this, we propose De-focus Attention Networks, which employ learnable bandpass filters to create varied attention patterns. During training, large and scheduled drop path rates, and an auxiliary loss on globally pooled features for global understanding tasks are introduced. These two strategies encourage the model to attend to a broader range of tokens and enhance network optimization. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating that 1D causal visual representation can perform comparably to 2D non-causal representation in tasks such as global perception, dense prediction, and multi-modal understanding. Code shall be released."
Poster,Learning 3D Equivariant Implicit Function with Patch-Level Pose-Invariant Representation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94544,"Xin Hu, Xiaole Tang, Ruixuan Yu, Jian Sun","Implicit neural representation gains popularity in modeling the continuous 3D surface for 3D representation and reconstruction. In this work, we are motivated by the fact that the local 3D patches repeatedly appear on 3D shapes/surfaces if the factor of poses is removed. Based on this observation, we propose the 3D patch-level equivariant implicit function (PEIF) based on the 3D patch-level pose-invariant representation, allowing us to reconstruct 3D surfaces by estimating equivariant displacement vector fields for query points. Specifically, our model is based on the pose-normalized query/patch pairs and enhanced by the proposed intrinsic patch geometry representation, modeling the intrinsic 3D patch geometry feature by learnable multi-head memory banks. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple surface reconstruction datasets, and also exhibits better generalization to crossdataset shapes and robustness to arbitrary rotations. Our code will be available at https://github.com/mathXin112/PEIF.git."
Poster,Learning 3D Garment Animation from Trajectories of A Piece of Cloth,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93003,"YIDI SHAO, Chen Change Loy, Bo Dai","Garment animation is ubiquitous in various applications, such as virtual reality, gaming, and film producing. Recently, learning-based approaches obtain compelling performance in animating diverse garments under versatile scenarios. Nevertheless, to mimic the deformations of the observed garments, data-driven methods require large scale of garment data, which are both resource-wise expensive and time-consuming. In addition, forcing models to match the dynamics of observed garment animation may hinder the potentials to generalize to unseen cases. In this paper, instead of using garment-wise supervised-learning we adopt a disentangled scheme to learn how to animate observed garments: 1). learning constitutive behaviors from the observed cloth; 2). dynamically animate various garments constrained by the learned constitutive laws. Specifically, we propose Energy Unit network (EUNet) to model the constitutive relations in the format of energy. Without the priors from analytical physics models and differentiable simulation engines, EUNet is able to directly capture the constitutive behaviors from the observed piece of cloth and uniformly describes the change of energy caused by deformations, such as stretching and bending. We further apply the pre-trained EUNet to animate various garments based on energy optimizations. The disentangled scheme alleviates the need of garment data and enables us to utilize the dynamics of a piece of cloth for animating garments. Experiments show that while EUNet effectively delivers the energy gradients due to the deformations, models constrained by EUNet achieve more stable and physically plausible performance comparing with those trained in garment-wise supervised manner."
Poster,Learning Action and Reasoning-Centric Image Editing from Videos and Simulation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97473,"Benno Krojer, Dheeraj Vattikonda, Luis Lara, Varun Jampani, Eva Portelance, Chris Pal, Siva Reddy","An image editing model should be able to perform diverse edits, ranging from object replacement, changing attributes or style, to performing actions or movement, which require many forms of reasoning. Current *general* instruction-guided editing models have significant shortcomings with action and reasoning-centric edits.Object, attribute or stylistic changes can be learned from visually static datasets. On the other hand, high-quality data for action and reasoning-centric edits is scarce and has to come from entirely different sources that cover e.g. physical dynamics, temporality and spatial reasoning.To this end, we meticulously curate the **A**U**RO**R**A** Dataset (**A**ction-**R**easoning-**O**bject-**A**ttribute), a collection of high-quality training data, human-annotated and curated from videos and simulation engines.We focus on a key aspect of quality training data: triplets (source image, prompt, target image) contain a single meaningful visual change described by the prompt, i.e., *truly minimal* changes between source and target images.To demonstrate the value of our dataset, we evaluate an **A**U**RO**R**A**-finetuned model on a new expert-curated benchmark (**A**U**RO**R**A-Bench**) covering 8 diverse editing tasks.Our model significantly outperforms previous editing models as judged by human raters.For automatic evaluations, we find important flaws in previous metrics and caution their use for semantically hard editing tasks.Instead, we propose a new automatic metric that focuses on discriminative understanding.We hope that our efforts : (1) curating a quality training dataset and an evaluation benchmark, (2) developing critical evaluations, and (3) releasing a state-of-the-art model, will fuel further progress on general image editing."
Poster,Learning an Actionable Discrete Diffusion Policy via Large-Scale Actionless Video Pre-Training,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95263,"Haoran He, Chenjia Bai, Ling Pan, Weinan Zhang, Bin Zhao, Xuelong Li","Learning a generalist embodied agent capable of completing multiple tasks poses challenges, primarily stemming from the scarcity of action-labeled robotic datasets. In contrast, a vast amount of human videos exist, capturing intricate tasks and interactions with the physical world. Promising prospects arise for utilizing actionless human videos for pre-training and transferring the knowledge to facilitate robot policy learning through limited robot demonstrations. However, it remains a challenge due to the domain gap between humans and robots. Moreover, it is difficult to extract useful information representing the dynamic world from human videos, because of its noisy and multimodal data structure. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework to tackle these challenges, which leverages a unified discrete diffusion to combine generative pre-training on human videos and policy fine-tuning on a small number of action-labeled robot videos. We start by compressing both human and robot videos into unified video tokens. In the pre-training stage, we employ a discrete diffusion model with a mask-and-replace diffusion strategy to predict future video tokens in the latent space. In the fine-tuning stage, we harness the imagined future videos to guide low-level action learning with a limited set of robot data. Experiments demonstrate that our method generates high-fidelity future videos for planning and enhances the fine-tuned policies compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches with superior performance."
Poster,Learning and Transferring Sparse Contextual Bigrams with Linear Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95275,"Yunwei Ren, Zixuan Wang, Jason Lee","Transformers have achieved significant success in natural language modeling because of their exceptional capabilities to combine contextual information and global knowledge, yet their theoretical basis remains unclear. In this paper, we first propose Sparse Contextual Bigram (SCB), a natural extension to the classical bigram model, where the generation of the next token depends on a sparse set of earlier positions determined by the last token. We investigate the training dynamics and sample complexity of learning SCB using a one-layer linear transformer with a gradient-based algorithm. We show that when trained from scratch, the training process can be split into an initial sample-intensive stage where the correlation is boosted from zero to a nontrivial value, followed by a more sample-efficient stage of further improvement. Additionally, we prove that, provided a nontrivial correlation between the downstream and pretraining tasks, finetuning from a pretrained model allows us to bypass the initial sample-intensive stage. We also empirically demonstrate that our algorithm can outperform SGD in our setting."
