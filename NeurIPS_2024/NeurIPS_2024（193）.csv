Poster,Idiographic Personality Gaussian Process for Psychological Assessment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95001,"Yehu Chen, Muchen Xi, Joshua Jackson, Jacob Montgomery, Roman Garnett","We develop a novel measurement framework based on Gaussian process coregionalization model to address a long-lasting debate in psychometrics: whether psychological features like personality share a common structure across the population or vary uniquely for individuals. We propose idiographic personality Gaussian process (IPGP), an intermediate model that accommodates both shared trait structure across individuals and ""idiographic"" deviations. IPGP leverages the Gaussian process coregionalization model to conceptualize responses of grouped survey batteries but adjusted to non-Gaussian ordinal data, and exploits stochastic variational inference for latent factor estimation. Using both synthetic data and a novel survey, we show that IPGP improves both prediction of actual responses and estimation of intrapersonal response patterns compared to existing benchmarks. In the survey study, IPGP also identifies unique clusters of personality taxonomies, displaying great potential in advancing individualized approaches to psychological diagnosis."
Poster,I Don't Know: Explicit Modeling of Uncertainty with an [IDK] Token,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94825,"Roi Cohen, Konstantin Dobler, Eden Biran, Gerard de Melo","Large Language Models are known to capture real-world knowledge, allowing them to excel in many downstream tasks. Despite recent advances, these models are still prone to what are commonly known as hallucinations, causing them to emit unwanted and factually incorrect text. In this work, we propose a novel calibration method that can be used to combat hallucinations. We add a special [IDK] (“I Don't Know”) token to the model's vocabulary and introduce an objective function that shifts probability mass to the [IDK] token for incorrect predictions. This approach allows the model to express uncertainty in its output explicitly. We evaluate our proposed method across multiple model architectures and factual downstream tasks.We find that models trained with our method are able to express uncertainty in places where they would previously make mistakes while suffering only a small loss of encoded knowledge. We further perform extensive ablation studies of multiple variations of our approach and provide a detailed analysis of the precision-recall tradeoff of our method."
Poster,ID-to-3D: Expressive ID-guided 3D Heads via Score Distillation Sampling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95108,"Francesca Babiloni, Alexandros Lattas, Jiankang Deng, Stefanos Zafeiriou","We propose ID-to-3D, a method to generate identity- and text-guided 3D human heads with disentangled expressions, starting from even a single casually captured ‘in-the-wild’ image of a subject. The foundation of our approach is anchored in compositionality, alongside the use of task-specific 2D diffusion models as priors for optimization. First, we extend a foundational model with a lightweight expression-aware and ID-aware architecture, and create 2D priors for geometric and texture generation, via fine-tuning only 0.2% of its available training parameters. Then, we jointly leverage a neural parametric representation for the expression of each subject and a multi-stage generation of highly detailed geometry and albedo texture. This combination of strong face identity embeddings and our neural representation enables accurate reconstruction of not only facial features but also accessories and hair, and can be meshed to provide render-ready assets for gaming and telepresence. Our results achieve an unprecedented level of id-consistent and high-quality texture and geometry generation, generalizing to a ‘world’ of unseen 3D identities, without relying on large 3D captured datasets of human assets."
Poster,IF-Font: Ideographic Description Sequence-Following Font Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94397,"Xinping Chen, Xiao Ke, Wenzhong Guo","Few-shot font generation (FFG) aims to learn the target style from a limited number of reference glyphs and generate the remaining glyphs in the target font. Previous works focus on disentangling the content and style features of glyphs, combining the content features of the source glyph with the style features of the reference glyph to generate new glyphs. However, the disentanglement is challenging due to the complexity of glyphs, often resulting in glyphs that are influenced by the style of the source glyph and prone to artifacts. We propose IF-Font, a novel paradigm which incorporates Ideographic Description Sequence (IDS) instead of the source glyph to control the semantics of generated glyphs. To achieve this, we quantize the reference glyphs into tokens, and model the token distribution of target glyphs using corresponding IDS and reference tokens. The proposed method excels in synthesizing glyphs with neat and correct strokes, and enables the creation of new glyphs based on provided IDS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method greatly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both one-shot and few-shot settings, particularly when the target styles differ significantly from the training font styles.

Poster,"If You Want to Be Robust, Be Wary of Initialization",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93648,"Sofiane ENNADIR, Johannes Lutzeyer, Michalis Vazirgiannis, El Houcine Bergou","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a spectrum of graph-related tasks, however concerns persist regarding their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. While prevailing defense strategies focus primarily on pre-processing techniques and adaptive message-passing schemes, this study delves into an under-explored dimension: the impact of weight initialization and associated hyper-parameters, such as training epochs, on a model’s robustness.We introduce a theoretical framework bridging the connection between initialization strategies and a network's resilience to adversarial perturbations. Our analysis reveals a direct relationship between initial weights, number of training epochs and the model’s vulnerability, offering new insights into adversarial robustness beyond conventional defense mechanisms. While our primary focus is on GNNs, we extend our theoretical framework, providing a general upper-bound applicable to Deep Neural Networks.Extensive experiments, spanning diverse models and real-world datasets subjected to various adversarial attacks, validate our findings. We illustrate that selecting appropriate initialization not only ensures performance on clean datasets but also enhances model robustness against adversarial perturbations, with observed gaps of up to 50\% compared to alternative initialization approaches."
Poster,II-Bench: An Image Implication Understanding Benchmark for Multimodal Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97557,"Ziqiang Liu, Feiteng Fang, Xi Feng, Xeron Du, Chenhao Zhang, Noah Wang, yuelin bai, Qixuan Zhao, Liyang Fan, CHENGGUANG GAN, Hongquan Lin, Jiaming Li, Yuansheng Ni, Haihong Wu, Yaswanth Narsupalli, Zhigang Zheng, Chengming Li, Xiping Hu, Ruifeng Xu, Xiaojun Chen, Min Yang, Jiaheng Liu, Ruibo Liu, Wenhao Huang, Ge Zhang, Shiwen Ni","The rapid advancements in the development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have consistently led to new breakthroughs on various benchmarks. In response, numerous challenging and comprehensive benchmarks have been proposed to more accurately assess the capabilities of MLLMs. However, there is a dearth of exploration of the higher-order perceptual capabilities of MLLMs. To fill this gap, we propose the Image Implication understanding Benchmark, II-Bench, which aims to evaluate the model's higher-order perception of images. Through extensive experiments on II-Bench across multiple MLLMs, we have made significant findings. Initially, a substantial gap is observed between the performance of MLLMs and humans on II-Bench. The pinnacle accuracy of MLLMs attains 74.8%, whereas human accuracy averages 90%, peaking at an impressive 98%. Subsequently, MLLMs perform worse on abstract and complex images, suggesting limitations in their ability to understand high-level semantics and capture image details. Finally, it is observed that most models exhibit enhanced accuracy when image sentiment polarity hints are incorporated into the prompts. This observation underscores a notable deficiency in their inherent understanding of image sentiment. We believe that II-Bench will inspire the community to develop the next generation of MLLMs, advancing the journey towards expert  artificial general intelligence (AGI). II-Bench is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/m-a-p/II-Bench."
Poster,IKEA Manuals at Work: 4D Grounding of Assembly Instructions on Internet Videos,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97790,"Yunong Liu, Cristobal Eyzaguirre, Manling Li, Shubh Khanna, Juan Carlos Niebles, Vineeth Ravi, Saumitra Mishra, Weiyu Liu, Jiajun Wu","Shape assembly is a ubiquitous task in daily life, integral for constructing complex 3D structures like IKEA furniture. While significant progress has been made in developing autonomous agents for shape assembly, existing datasets have not yet tackled the 4D grounding of assembly instructions in videos, essential for a holistic understanding of assembly in 3D space over time. We introduce IKEA Video Manuals, a dataset that features 3D models of furniture parts, instructional manuals, assembly videos from the Internet, and most importantly, annotations of dense spatio-temporal alignments between these data modalities. To demonstrate the utility of IKEA Video Manuals, we present five applications essential for shape assembly: assembly plan generation, part-conditioned segmentation, part-conditioned pose estimation, video object segmentation, and furniture assembly based on instructional video manuals. For each application, we provide evaluation metrics and baseline methods. Through experiments on our annotated data, we highlight many challenges in grounding assembly instructions in videos to improve shape assembly, including handling occlusions, varying viewpoints, and extended assembly sequences."
Poster,IllumiNeRF: 3D Relighting Without Inverse Rendering,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93917,"Xiaoming Zhao, Pratul Srinivasan, Dor Verbin, Keunhong Park, Ricardo Martin Brualla, Philipp Henzler","Existing methods for relightable view synthesis --- using a set of images of an object under unknown lighting to recover a 3D representation that can be rendered from novel viewpoints under a target illumination --- are based on inverse rendering, and attempt to disentangle the object geometry, materials, and lighting that explain the input images. Furthermore, this typically involves optimization through differentiable Monte Carlo rendering, which is brittle and computationally-expensive. In this work, we propose a simpler approach: we first relight each input image using an image diffusion model conditioned on target environment lighting and estimated object geometry. We then reconstruct a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) with these relit images, from which we render novel views under the target lighting. We demonstrate that this strategy is surprisingly competitive and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple relighting benchmarks.

Poster,Image2Struct: Benchmarking Structure Extraction for Vision-Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97829,"Josselin Roberts, Tony Lee, Chi Heem Wong, Michihiro Yasunaga, Yifan Mai, Percy Liang","We introduce Image2Struct, a benchmark to evaluate vision-language models (VLMs) on extracting structure from images.Our benchmark 1) captures real-world use cases, 2) is fully automatic and does not require human judgment, and 3) is based on a renewable stream of fresh data.In Image2Struct, VLMs are prompted to generate the underlying structure (e.g., LaTeX code or HTML) from an input image (e.g., webpage screenshot).The structure is then rendered to produce an output image (e.g., rendered webpage), which is compared against the input image to produce a similarity score.This round-trip evaluation allows us to quantitatively evaluate VLMs on tasks with multiple valid structures.We create a pipeline that downloads fresh data from active online communities upon execution and evaluates the VLMs without human intervention.We introduce three domains (Webpages, LaTeX, and Musical Scores) and use five image metrics (pixel similarity, cosine similarity between the Inception vectors, learned perceptual image patch similarity, structural similarity index measure, and earth mover similarity) that allow efficient and automatic comparison between pairs of images. We evaluate Image2Struct on 14 prominent VLMs and find that scores vary widely, indicating that Image2Struct can differentiate between the performances of different VLMs.Additionally, the best score varies considerably across domains (e.g., 0.402 on sheet music vs. 0.830 on LaTeX equations), indicating that Image2Struct contains tasks of varying difficulty.For transparency, we release the full results at  https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/image2struct/v1.0.1/."
Poster,Image-aware Evaluation of Generated Medical Reports,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94257,"Gefen Dawidowicz, Elad Hirsch, Ayellet Tal","The paper proposes a novel evaluation metric for automatic medical report generation from X-ray images, VLScore. It aims to overcome the limitations of existing evaluation methods, which either focus solely on textual similarities, ignoring clinical aspects, or concentrate only on a single clinical aspect, the pathology, neglecting all other factors. The key idea of our metric is to measure the similarity between radiology reports while considering the corresponding image. We demonstrate the benefit of our metric through evaluation on a dataset where radiologists marked errors in pairs of reports, showing notable alignment with radiologists' judgments. In addition, we provide a new dataset for evaluating metrics. This dataset includes well-designed perturbations that distinguish between significant modifications (e.g., removal of a diagnosis) and insignificant ones. It highlights the weaknesses in current evaluation metrics and provides a clear framework for analysis."
