Poster,Image Copy Detection for Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94110,"Wenhao Wang, Yifan Sun, Zhentao Tan, Yi Yang","Images produced by diffusion models are increasingly popular in digital artwork and visual marketing. However, such generated images might replicate content from existing ones and pose the challenge of content originality. Existing Image Copy Detection (ICD) models, though accurate in detecting hand-crafted replicas, overlook the challenge from diffusion models. This motivates us to introduce ICDiff, the first ICD specialized for diffusion models. To this end, we construct a Diffusion-Replication (D-Rep) dataset and correspondingly propose a novel deep embedding method. D-Rep uses a state-of-the-art diffusion model (Stable Diffusion V1.5) to generate 40, 000 image-replica pairs, which are manually annotated into 6 replication levels ranging from 0 (no replication) to 5 (total replication). Our method, PDF-Embedding, transforms the replication level of each image-replica pair into a probability density function (PDF) as the supervision signal. The intuition is that the probability of neighboring replication levels should be continuous and smooth. Experimental results show that PDF-Embedding surpasses protocol-driven methods and non-PDF choices on the D-Rep test set. Moreover, by utilizing PDF-Embedding, we find that the replication ratios of well-known diffusion models against an open-source gallery range from 10% to 20%.

Poster,ImageNet3D: Towards General-Purpose Object-Level 3D Understanding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97507,"Wufei Ma, Guofeng Zhang, Qihao Liu, Guanning Zeng, Adam Kortylewski, Yaoyao Liu, Alan Yuille","A vision model with general-purpose object-level 3D understanding should be capable of inferring both 2D (*e.g.*, class name and bounding box) and 3D information (*e.g.*, 3D location and 3D viewpoint) for arbitrary rigid objects in natural images. This is a challenging task, as it involves inferring 3D information from 2D signals and most importantly, generalizing to rigid objects from unseen categories. However, existing datasets with object-level 3D annotations are often limited by the number of categories or the quality of annotations. Models developed on these datasets become specialists for certain categories or domains, and fail to generalize. In this work, we present ImageNet3D, a large dataset for general-purpose object-level 3D understanding. ImageNet3D augments 200 categories from the ImageNet dataset with 2D bounding box, 3D pose, 3D location annotations, and image captions interleaved with 3D information. With the new annotations available in ImageNet3D, we could (i) analyze the object-level 3D awareness of visual foundation models, and (ii) study and develop general-purpose models that infer both 2D and 3D information for arbitrary rigid objects in natural images, and (iii) integrate unified 3D models with large language models for 3D-related reasoning. We consider two new tasks, probing of object-level 3D awareness and open vocabulary pose estimation, besides standard classification and pose estimation. Experimental results on ImageNet3D demonstrate the potential of our dataset in building vision models with stronger general-purpose object-level 3D understanding.

Poster,Image Reconstruction Via Autoencoding Sequential Deep Image Prior,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95683,"Ismail Alkhouri, Shijun Liang, Evan Bell, Qing Qu, Rongrong Wang, Saiprasad Ravishankar","Recently, Deep Image Prior (DIP) has emerged as an effective unsupervised one-shot learner, delivering competitive results across various image recovery problems. This method only requires the noisy measurements and a forward operator, relying solely on deep networks initialized with random noise to learn and restore the structure of the data. However, DIP is notorious for its vulnerability to overfitting due to the overparameterization of the network. Building upon insights into the impact of the DIP input and drawing inspiration from the gradual denoising process in cutting-edge diffusion models, we introduce Autoencoding Sequential DIP (aSeqDIP) for image reconstruction. This method progressively denoises and reconstructs the image through a sequential optimization of network weights. This is achieved using an input-adaptive DIP objective, combined with an autoencoding regularization term. Compared to diffusion models, our method does not require training data and outperforms other DIP-based methods in mitigating noise overfitting while maintaining a similar number of parameter updates as Vanilla DIP. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our method in various image reconstruction tasks, such as MRI and CT reconstruction, as well as in image restoration tasks like image denoising, inpainting, and non-linear deblurring."
Poster,Images that Sound: Composing Images and Sounds on a Single Canvas,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94585,"Ziyang Chen, Daniel Geng, Andrew Owens","Spectrograms are 2D representations of sound that look very different from the images found in our visual world. And natural images, when played as spectrograms, make unnatural sounds. In this paper, we show that it is possible to synthesize spectrograms that simultaneously look like natural images and sound like natural audio. We call these visual spectrograms *images that sound*. Our approach is simple and zero-shot, and it leverages pre-trained text-to-image and text-to-spectrogram diffusion models that operate in a shared latent space. During the reverse process, we denoise noisy latents with both the audio and image diffusion models in parallel, resulting in a sample that is likely under both models. Through quantitative evaluations and perceptual studies, we find that our method successfully generates spectrograms that align with a desired audio prompt while also taking the visual appearance of a desired image prompt."
Poster,Image Textualization: An Automatic Framework for Generating Rich and Detailed Image Descriptions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97538,"Renjie Pi, Jianshu Zhang, Jipeng Zhang, Rui Pan, Zhekai Chen, Tong Zhang","Image description datasets play a crucial role in the advancement of various applications such as image understanding, text-to-image generation, and text-image retrieval. Currently, image description datasets primarily originate from two sources. One source is the scraping of image-text pairs from the web. Despite their abundance, these descriptions are often of low quality and noisy. Another way is through human labeling. Datasets such as COCO are generally very short and lack details. Although detailed image descriptions can be annotated by humans, the high cost limits their quantity and feasibility. These limitations underscore the need for more efficient and scalable methods to generate accurate and detailed image descriptions. In this paper, we propose an innovative framework termed Image Textualization, which automatically produces high-quality image descriptions by leveraging existing mult-modal large language models (MLLMs) and multiple vision expert models in a collaborative manner. We conduct various experiments to validate the high quality of the descriptions constructed by our framework. Furthermore, we show that MLLMs fine-tuned on our dataset acquire an unprecedented capability of generating richer image descriptions, substantially increasing the length and detail of their output with even less hallucinations."
Poster,Image Understanding Makes for A Good Tokenizer for Image Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95176,"Luting Wang, Yang Zhao, Zijian Zhang, Jiashi Feng, Si Liu, Bingyi Kang","Modern image generation (IG) models have been shown to capture rich semantics valuable for image understanding (IU) tasks. However, the potential of IU models to improve IG performance remains uncharted. We address this issue using a token-based IG framework, which relies on effective tokenizers to project images into token sequences. Currently, **pixel reconstruction** (e.g., VQGAN) dominates the training objective for image tokenizers. In contrast, our approach adopts the **feature reconstruction** objective, where tokenizers are trained by distilling knowledge from pretrained IU encoders. Comprehensive comparisons indicate that tokenizers with strong IU capabilities achieve superior IG performance across a variety of metrics, datasets, tasks, and proposal networks. Notably, VQ-KD CLIP achieves $4.10$ FID on ImageNet-1k (IN-1k). Visualization suggests that the superiority of VQ-KD can be partly attributed to the rich semantics within the VQ-KD codebook. We further introduce a straightforward pipeline to directly transform IU encoders into tokenizers, demonstrating exceptional effectiveness for IG tasks. These discoveries may energize further exploration into image tokenizer research and inspire the community to reassess the relationship between IU and IG. The code is released at https://github.com/magic-research/vector_quantization."
Poster,IMAGPose: A Unified Conditional Framework for Pose-Guided Person Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96534,"Fei Shen, Jinhui Tang","Diffusion models represent a promising avenue for image generation, having demonstrated competitive performance in pose-guided person image generation. However, existing methods are limited to generating target images from a source image and a target pose, overlooking two critical user scenarios: generating multiple target images with different poses simultaneously and generating target images from multi-view source images.To overcome these limitations, we propose IMAGPose, a unified conditional framework for pose-guided image generation, which incorporates three pivotal modules: a feature-level conditioning (FLC) module, an image-level conditioning (ILC) module, and a cross-view attention (CVA) module. Firstly, the FLC module combines the low-level texture feature from the VAE encoder with the high-level semantic feature from the image encoder, addressing the issue of missing detail information due to the absence of a dedicated person image feature extractor. Then, the ILC module achieves an alignment of images and poses to adapt to flexible and diverse user scenarios by injecting a variable number of source image conditions and introducing a masking strategy.Finally, the CVA module introduces decomposing global and local cross-attention, ensuring local fidelity and global consistency of the person image when multiple source image prompts. The three modules of IMAGPose work together to unify the task of person image generation under various user scenarios.Extensive experiment results demonstrate the consistency and photorealism of our proposed IMAGPose under challenging user scenarios. The code and model will be available at https://github.com/muzishen/IMAGPose."
Poster,IMDL-BenCo: A Comprehensive Benchmark and Codebase for Image Manipulation Detection & Localization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97594,"Xiaochen Ma, Xuekang Zhu, Lei Su, Bo Du, Zhuohang Jiang, Bingkui Tong, Zeyu Lei, Xinyu Yang, Chi-Man Pun, Jiancheng Lv, Ji-Zhe Zhou","A comprehensive benchmark is yet to be established in the Image Manipulation Detection \& Localization (IMDL) field. The absence of such a benchmark leads to insufficient and misleading model evaluations, severely undermining the development of this field. However, the scarcity of open-sourced baseline models and inconsistent training and evaluation protocols make conducting rigorous experiments and faithful comparisons among IMDL models challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce IMDL-BenCo, the first comprehensive IMDL benchmark and modular codebase. IMDL-BenCo: i) decomposes the IMDL framework into standardized, reusable components and revises the model construction pipeline, improving coding efficiency and customization flexibility; ii) fully implements or incorporates training code for state-of-the-art models to establish a comprehensive IMDL benchmark; and iii) conducts deep analysis based on the established benchmark and codebase, offering new insights into IMDL model architecture, dataset characteristics, and evaluation standards.Specifically, IMDL-BenCo includes common processing algorithms, 8 state-of-the-art IMDL models (1 of which are reproduced from scratch), 2 sets of standard training and evaluation protocols, 15 GPU-accelerated evaluation metrics, and 3 kinds of robustness evaluation. This benchmark and codebase represent a significant leap forward in calibrating the current progress in the IMDL field and inspiring future breakthroughs.Code is available at: https://github.com/scu-zjz/IMDLBenCo"
Poster,Imitating Language via Scalable Inverse Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96578,"Markus Wulfmeier, Michael Bloesch, Nino Vieillard, Arun Ahuja, Jorg Bornschein, Sandy Huang, Artem Sokolov, Matt Barnes, Guillaume Desjardins, Alex Bewley, Sarah Bechtle, Jost Springenberg, Nikola Momchev, Olivier Bachem, Matthieu Geist, Martin Riedmiller","The majority of language model training builds on imitation learning. It covers pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and affects the starting conditions for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The simplicity and scalability of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for next token prediction led to its role as predominant paradigm. However, the broader field of imitation learning can more effectively utilize the sequential structure underlying autoregressive generation. We focus on investigating the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) perspective to imitation, extracting rewards and directly optimizing sequences instead of individual token likelihoods and evaluate its benefits for fine-tuning large language models.  We provide a new angle, reformulating inverse soft-Q-learning as a temporal difference regularized extension of MLE. This creates a principled connection between MLE and IRL and allows trading off added complexity with increased performance and diversity of generations in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) setting. We find clear advantages for IRL-based imitation, in particular for retaining diversity while maximizing task performance, rendering IRL a strong alternative on fixed SFT datasets even without online data generation. Our analysis of IRL-extracted reward functions further indicates benefits for more robust reward functions via tighter integration of supervised and preference-based LLM post-training."
Poster,Immiscible Diffusion: Accelerating Diffusion Training with Noise Assignment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93906,"Yiheng Li, Heyang Jiang, Akio Kodaira, Masayoshi TOMIZUKA, Kurt Keutzer, Chenfeng Xu","In this paper, we point out that suboptimal noise-data mapping leads to slow training of diffusion models. During diffusion training, current methods diffuse each image across the entire noise space, resulting in a mixture of all images at every point in the noise layer. We emphasize that this random mixture of noise-data mapping complicates the optimization of the denoising function in diffusion models. Drawing inspiration from the immiscibility phenomenon in physics, we propose *Immiscible Diffusion*, a simple and effective method to improve the random mixture of noise-data mapping. In physics, miscibility can vary according to various intermolecular forces. Thus, immiscibility means that the mixing of molecular sources is distinguishable. Inspired by this concept, we propose an assignment-then-diffusion training strategy to achieve *Immiscible Diffusion*. As one example, prior to diffusing the image data into noise, we assign diffusion target noise for the image data by minimizing the total image-noise pair distance in a mini-batch. The assignment functions analogously to external forces to expel the diffuse-able areas of images, thus mitigating the inherent difficulties in diffusion training. Our approach is remarkably simple, requiring only *one line of code* to restrict the diffuse-able area for each image while preserving the Gaussian distribution of noise. In this way, each image is preferably projected to nearby noise. To address the high complexity of the assignment algorithm, we employ a quantized assignment strategy, which significantly reduces the computational overhead to a negligible level (e.g. 22.8ms for a large batch size of 1024 on an A6000). Experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve up to 3x faster training for unconditional Consistency Models on the CIFAR dataset, as well as for DDIM and Stable Diffusion on CelebA and ImageNet dataset, and in class-conditional training and fine-tuning. In addition, we conducted a thorough analysis that sheds light on how it improves diffusion training speed while improving fidelity.
