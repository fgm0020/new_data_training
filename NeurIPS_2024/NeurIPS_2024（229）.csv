Poster,Learning to Edit Visual Programs with Self-Supervision,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93236,"R. Kenny Jones, Renhao Zhang, Aditya Ganeshan, Daniel Ritchie","We design a system that learns how to edit visual programs. Our edit network consumes a complete input program and a visual target. From this input, we task our network with predicting a local edit operation that could be applied to the input program to improve its similarity to the target. In order to apply this scheme for domains that lack program annotations, we develop a self-supervised learning approach that integrates this edit network into a bootstrapped finetuning loop along with a network that predicts entire programs in one-shot. Our joint finetuning scheme, when coupled with an inference procedure that initializes a population from the one-shot model and evolves members of this population with the edit network, helps to infer more accurate visual programs. Over multiple domains, we experimentally compare our method against the alternative of using only the one-shot model, and find that even under equal search-time budgets, our editing-based paradigm provides significant advantages."
Poster,Learning to Embed Distributions via Maximum Kernel Entropy,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96284,"Oleksii Kachaiev, Stefano Recanatesi","Empirical data can often be considered as samples from a set of probability distributions. Kernel methods have emerged as a natural approach for learning to classify these distributions. Although numerous kernels between distributions have been proposed, applying kernel methods to distribution regression tasks remains challenging, primarily because selecting a suitable kernel is not straightforward. Surprisingly, the question of learning a data-dependent distribution kernel has received little attention. In this paper, we propose a novel objective for the unsupervised learning of data-dependent distribution kernel, based on the principle of entropy maximization in the space of probability measure embeddings. We examine the theoretical properties of the latent embedding space induced by our objective, demonstrating that its geometric structure is well-suited for solving downstream discriminative tasks. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the learned kernel across different modalities."
Poster,Learning to grok: Emergence of in-context learning and skill composition in modular arithmetic tasks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94548,"Tianyu He, Darshil Doshi, Aritra Das, Andrey Gromov","Large language models can solve tasks that were not present in the training set. This capability is believed to be due to in-context learning and skill composition. In this work, we study the emergence of in-context learning and skill composition in a collection of modular arithmetic tasks. Specifically, we consider a finite collection of linear modular functions $z = a  x + b  y \text{ mod } p$ labeled by the vector $(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z}_p^2$. We use some of these tasks for pre-training and the rest for out-of-distribution testing. We empirically show that a GPT-style transformer exhibits a transition from in-distribution to out-of-distribution generalization as the number of pre-training tasks increases. We find that the smallest model capable of out-of-distribution generalization requires two transformer blocks, while for deeper models, the out-of-distribution generalization phase is *transient*, necessitating early stopping. Finally, we perform an interpretability study of the pre-trained models, revealing highly structured representations in both attention heads and MLPs; and discuss the learned algorithms. Notably, we find an algorithmic shift in deeper models, as we go from few to many in-context examples."
Poster,Learning to Handle Complex Constraints  for Vehicle Routing Problems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95638,"Jieyi Bi, Yining Ma, Jianan Zhou, Wen Song, Zhiguang Cao, Yaoxin Wu, Jie Zhang","Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) can model many real-world scenarios and often involve complex constraints. While recent neural methods excel in constructing solutions based on feasibility masking, they struggle with handling complex constraints, especially when obtaining the masking itself is NP-hard. In this paper, we propose a novel Proactive Infeasibility Prevention (PIP) framework to advance the capabilities of neural methods towards more complex VRPs. Our PIP integrates the Lagrangian multiplier as a basis to enhance constraint awareness and introduces preventative infeasibility masking to proactively steer the solution construction process. Moreover, we present PIP-D, which employs an auxiliary decoder and two adaptive strategies to learn and predict these tailored masks, potentially enhancing performance while significantly reducing computational costs during training. To verify our PIP designs, we conduct extensive experiments on the highly challenging Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Window (TSPTW), and TSP with Draft Limit (TSPDL) variants under different constraint hardness levels. Notably, our PIP is generic to boost many neural methods, and exhibits both a significant reduction in infeasible rate and a substantial improvement in solution quality."
Poster,Learning to Merge Tokens via Decoupled Embedding for Efficient Vision Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93549,"Dong Hoon Lee, Seunghoon Hong","Recent token reduction methods for Vision Transformers (ViTs) incorporate token merging, which measures the similarities between token embeddings and combines the most similar pairs.However, their merging policies are directly dependent on intermediate features in ViTs, which prevents exploiting features tailored for merging and requires end-to-end training to improve token merging.In this paper, we propose Decoupled Token Embedding for Merging (DTEM) that enhances token merging through a decoupled embedding learned via a continuously relaxed token merging process.Our method introduces a lightweight embedding module decoupled from the ViT forward pass to extract dedicated features for token merging, thereby addressing the restriction from using intermediate features.The continuously relaxed token merging, applied during training, enables us to learn the decoupled embeddings in a differentiable manner.Thanks to the decoupled structure, our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing ViT backbones and trained either modularly by learning only the decoupled embeddings or end-to-end by fine-tuning. We demonstrate the applicability of DTEM on various tasks, including classification, captioning, and segmentation, with consistent improvement in token merging.Especially in the ImageNet-1k classification, DTEM achieves a 37.2\% reduction in FLOPs while maintaining a top-1 accuracy of 79.85\% with DeiT-small."
Poster,Learning to Mitigate Externalities: the Coase Theorem with Hindsight Rationality,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93602,"Antoine Scheid, Aymeric Capitaine, Etienne Boursier, Eric Moulines, Michael Jordan, Alain Durmus","In Economics, the concept of externality refers to any indirect effect resulting from an interaction between players and affecting a third party without compensation. Most of the models within which externality has been studied assume that agents have perfect knowledge of their environment and preferences. This is a major hindrance to the practical implementation of many proposed solutions. To adress this issue, we consider a two-players bandit game setting where the actions of one of the player affect the other one. Building upon this setup, we extend the Coase theorem [Coase, 2013], which suggests that the optimal approach for maximizing the social welfare in the presence of externality is to establish property rights, i.e., enabling transfers and bargaining between the players. Nonetheless, this fundamental result relies on the assumption that bargainers possess perfect knowledge of the underlying game. We first demonstrate that in the absence of property rights in the considered online scenario, the social welfare breaks down. We then provide a policy for the players, which allows them to learn a bargaining strategy which maximizes the total welfare, recovering the Coase theorem under uncertainty."
Poster,Learning to Predict Structural Vibrations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94031,"Jan van Delden, Julius Schultz, Christopher Blech, Sabine Langer, Timo Lüddecke","In mechanical structures like airplanes, cars and houses, noise is generated and transmitted through vibrations. To take measures to reduce this noise, vibrations need to be simulated with expensive numerical computations. Deep learning surrogate models present a promising alternative to classical numerical simulations as they can be evaluated magnitudes faster, while trading-off accuracy. To quantify such trade-offs systematically and foster the development of methods, we present a benchmark on the task of predicting the vibration of harmonically excited plates. The benchmark features a total of 12,000 plate geometries with varying forms of beadings, material, boundary conditions, load position and sizes with associated numerical solutions. To address the benchmark task, we propose a new network architecture, named \modelname, which predicts vibration patterns of plate geometries given a specific excitation frequency. Applying principles from operator learning and implicit models for shape encoding, our approach effectively addresses the prediction of highly variable frequency response functions occurring in dynamic systems. To quantify the prediction quality, we introduce a set of evaluation metrics and evaluate the method on our vibrating-plates benchmark. Our method outperforms DeepONets, Fourier Neural Operators and more traditional neural network architectures and can be used for design optimization.Code, dataset and visualizations: https://github.com/ecker-lab/Learning_Vibrating_Plates"
Poster,Learning to Price Homogeneous Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95644,"Keran Chen, Joon Suk Huh, Kirthevasan Kandasamy","We study a data pricing problem, where a seller has access to $N$ homogeneous data points (e.g. drawn i.i.d. from some distribution).There are $m$ types of buyers in the market, where buyers of the same type $i$ have the same valuation curve $v_i:[N]\rightarrow [0,1]$, where $v_i(n)$ is the value for having $n$ data points.*A priori*, the seller is unaware of thedistribution of buyers, but can repeat the market for $T$ rounds so as to learn the revenue-optimal pricing curve $p:[N] \rightarrow [0, 1]$.To solve this online learning problem,we first develop novel discretization schemes to approximate any pricing curve.When compared to prior work,the size of our discretization schemes scales gracefully with the approximation parameter, which translates to better regret in online learning.Under assumptions like smoothness and diminishing returns which are satisfied by data, the discretization size can be reduced further.We then turn to the online learning problem, both in the stochastic and adversarial settings.On each round, the seller chooses an *anonymous* pricing curve $p_t$.A new buyer appears and may choose to purchase some amount of data.She then reveals her type *only if* she makes a purchase.Our online algorithms build on classical algorithms such as UCB and FTPL, but require novel ideas to account for the asymmetric nature of this feedback and to deal with the vastness of the space of pricing curves.Using the improved discretization schemes previously developed, we are able to achieve $\widetilde{O}(m\sqrt{T})$ regret in the stochastic setting and $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(m^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ regret in the adversarial setting."
Poster,Learning to Reason Iteratively and Parallelly for Complex Visual Reasoning Scenarios,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93246,"Shantanu Jaiswal, Debaditya Roy, Basura Fernando, Cheston Tan","Complex visual reasoning and question answering (VQA) is a challenging task that requires compositional multi-step processing and higher-level reasoning capabilities beyond the immediate recognition and localization of objects and events. Here, we introduce a fully neural Iterative and Parallel Reasoning Mechanism (IPRM) that combines two distinct forms of computation -- iterative and parallel -- to better address complex VQA scenarios.  Specifically, IPRM's ""iterative"" computation facilitates compositional step-by-step reasoning for scenarios wherein individual operations need to be computed, stored, and recalled dynamically (e.g. when computing the query “determine the color of pen to the left of the child in red t-shirt sitting at the white table”). Meanwhile, its  ""parallel'' computation allows for the simultaneous exploration of different reasoning paths and benefits more robust and efficient execution of  operations that are mutually independent (e.g. when counting individual colors for the query: ""determine the maximum occurring color amongst all t-shirts'""). We design IPRM as a lightweight and fully-differentiable neural module that can be conveniently applied to both transformer and non-transformer vision-language backbones. It notably outperforms prior task-specific methods and transformer-based attention modules across various image and video VQA benchmarks testing distinct complex reasoning capabilities such as compositional spatiotemporal reasoning (AGQA), situational reasoning (STAR), multi-hop reasoning generalization (CLEVR-Humans) and causal event linking (CLEVRER-Humans). Further, IPRM's internal computations can be visualized across reasoning steps, aiding interpretability and diagnosis of its errors."
Poster,"Learning to Reason via Program Generation, Emulation, and Search",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93319,"Nathaniel Weir, Muhammad Khalifa, Linlu Qiu, Orion Weller, Peter Clark","Program synthesis with language models (LMs) has unlocked a large set of reasoning abilities; code-tuned LMs have proven adept at generating programs that solve a wide variety of algorithmic symbolic manipulation tasks (e.g. word concatenation). However, not all reasoning tasks are easily expressible as code, e.g. tasks involving commonsense reasoning, moral decision-making, and sarcasm understanding. Our goal is to extend a LM’s program synthesis skills to such tasks and evaluate the results via pseudo-programs, namely Python programs where some leaf function calls are left undefined. To that end, we propose, Code Generation and Emulated EXecution (COGEX). COGEX works by (1) training LMs to generate pseudo-programs and (2) teaching them to emulate their generated program’s execution, including those leaf functions, allowing the LM’s knowledge to fill in the execution gaps; and (3) using them to search over many programs to find an optimal one. To adapt the COGEX model to a new task, we introduce a method for performing program search to find a single program whose pseudo-execution yields optimal performance when applied to all the instances of a given dataset. We show that our approach yields large improvements compared to standard in-context learning approaches on a battery of tasks, both algorithmic and soft reasoning. This result thus demonstrates that code synthesis can be applied to a much broader class of problems than previously considered."
