Poster,LRM-Zero: Training Large Reconstruction Models with Synthesized Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95485,"Desai Xie, Sai Bi, Zhixin Shu, Kai Zhang, Zexiang Xu, Yi Zhou, Soeren Pirk, Arie Kaufman, Xin Sun, Hao Tan","We present LRM-Zero, a Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) trained entirely on synthesized 3D data, achieving high-quality sparse-view 3D reconstruction. The core of LRM-Zero is our procedural 3D dataset, Zeroverse, which is automatically synthesized from simple primitive shapes with random texturing and augmentations (e.g., height fields, boolean differences, and wireframes). Unlike previous 3D datasets (e.g., Objaverse) which are often captured or crafted by humans to approximate real 3D data, Zeroverse completely ignores realistic global semantics but is rich in complex geometric and texture details that are locally similar to or even more intricate than real objects. We demonstrate that our LRM-Zero, trained with our fully synthesized Zeroverse, can achieve high visual quality in the reconstruction of real-world objects, competitive with models trained on Objaverse. We also analyze several critical design choices of Zeroverse that contribute to LRM-Zero's capability and training stability. Our work demonstrates that 3D reconstruction, one of the core tasks in 3D vision, can potentially be addressed without the semantics of real-world objects. The Zeroverse's procedural synthesis code and interactive visualization are available at: https://desaixie.github.io/lrm-zero/."
Poster,LSH-MoE: Communication-efficient MoE Training via Locality-Sensitive Hashing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94467,"Xiaonan Nie, Liu Qibin, Fangcheng Fu, Shenhan Zhu, Xupeng Miao, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Bin CUI","Larger transformer models perform better on various downstream tasks but require more cost to scale up the model size. To efficiently enlarge models, the Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) architecture is widely adopted, which consists of a gate network and a series of experts and keep the training cost constant by routing the input data to a fixed number of experts instead of all.In existing large-scale MoE training systems, experts would be distributed among different GPUs for parallelization, and thus input data requires additional all-to-all communication to access the target expert and conduct corresponding computation. However, upon evaluating the training process of three mainstream MoE models on commonly used GPU clusters, we found that the all-to-all communication ratio averaged around 45\%, which significantly hinders the training efficiency and scalability of MoE models.In this paper, we propose LSH-MoE, a communication-efficient MoE training framework using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). We first present the problems of scaling MoE training in existing systems and highlight the potential of exploiting token similarity to facilitate data compression.Then, we introduce an efficient LSH-based compression technique, which utilizes the cross-polytope hashing for rapid clustering and implements a residual-based error compensation scheme to alleviate the adverse impact of compression. To verify the effectiveness of our methods, we conduct experiments on both language models (e.g., RoBERTa, GPT, and T5) and vision models (e.g., Swin) for both pre-training and fine-tuning tasks. The results demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms its counterparts across different tasks by 1.28-2.2$\times$ of speedup."
Poster,LT-Defense: Searching-free Backdoor Defense via Exploiting the Long-tailed Effect,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93944,"Yixiao Xu, Binxing Fang, Mohan Li, Keke Tang, Zhihong Tian","Language models have shown vulnerability against backdoor attacks, threatening the security of services based on them. To mitigate the threat, existing solutions attempted to search for backdoor triggers, which can be time-consuming when handling a large search space. Looking into the attack process, we observe that poisoned data will create a long-tailed effect in the victim model, causing the decision boundary to shift towards the attack targets. Inspired by this observation, we introduce LT-Defense, the first searching-free backdoor defense via exploiting the long-tailed effect. Specifically, LT-Defense employs a small set of clean examples and two metrics to distinguish backdoor-related features in the target model. Upon detecting a backdoor model, LT-Defense additionally provides test-time backdoor freezing and attack target prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LT-Defense in both detection accuracy and efficiency, e.g., in task-agnostic scenarios, LT-Defense achieves 98% accuracy across 1440 models with less than 1% of the time cost of state-of-the-art solutions."
Poster,L-TTA: Lightweight Test-Time Adaptation Using a Versatile Stem Layer,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95927,"Jin Shin, Hyun Kim","Test-time adaptation (TTA) is the most realistic methodology for adapting deep learning models to the real world using only unlabeled data from the target domain. Numerous TTA studies in deep learning have aimed at minimizing entropy. However, this necessitates forward/backward processes across the entire model and is limited by the incapability to fully leverage data based solely on entropy. This study presents a groundbreaking TTA solution that involves a departure from the conventional focus on minimizing entropy. Our innovative approach uniquely remodels the stem layer (i.e., the first layer) to emphasize minimizing a new learning criterion, namely, uncertainty. This method requires minimal involvement of the model's backbone, with only the stem layer participating in the TTA process. This approach significantly reduces the memory required for training and enables rapid adaptation to the target domain with minimal parameter updates. Moreover, to maximize data leveraging, the stem layer applies a discrete wavelet transform to the input features. It extracts multi-frequency domains and focuses on minimizing their individual uncertainties. The proposed method integrated into ResNet-26 and ResNet-50 models demonstrates its robustness by achieving outstanding TTA performance while using the least amount of memory compared to existing studies on CIFAR-10-C, ImageNet-C, and Cityscapes-C benchmark datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/janus103/L_TTA."
Poster,LucidAction: A Hierarchical and Multi-model Dataset for Comprehensive Action Quality Assessment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97542,"Linfeng Dong, Wei Wang, Yu Qiao, Xiao Sun","Action Quality Assessment (AQA) research confronts formidable obstacles due to limited, mono-modal datasets sourced from one-shot competitions, which hinder the generalizability and comprehensiveness of AQA models. To address these limitations, we present LucidAction, the first systematically collected multi-view AQA dataset structured on curriculum learning principles. LucidAction features a three-tier hierarchical structure, encompassing eight diverse sports events with four curriculum levels, facilitating sequential skill mastery and supporting a wide range of athletic abilities. The dataset encompasses multi-modal data, including multi-view RGB video, 2D and 3D pose sequences, enhancing the richness of information available for analysis. Leveraging a high-precision multi-view Motion Capture (MoCap) system ensures precise capture of complex movements. Meticulously annotated data, incorporating detailed penalties from professional gymnasts, ensures the establishment of robust and comprehensive ground truth annotations. Experimental evaluations employing diverse contrastive regression baselines on LucidAction elucidate the dataset's complexities. Through ablation studies, we investigate the advantages conferred by multi-modal data and fine-grained annotations, offering insights into improving AQA performance. The data and code will be openly released to support advancements in the AI sports field."
Poster,Lumen: Unleashing Versatile Vision-Centric Capabilities of Large Multimodal Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93228,"Yang Jiao, Shaoxiang Chen, Zequn Jie, Jingjing Chen, Lin Ma, Yu-Gang Jiang","Large Multimodal Model (LMM) is a hot research topic in the computer vision area and has also demonstrated remarkable potential across multiple disciplinary fields. A recent trend is to further extend and enhance the perception capabilities of LMMs. The current methods follow the paradigm of adapting the visual task outputs to the format of the language model, which is the main component of a LMM. This adaptation leads to convenient development of such LMMs with minimal modifications, however, it overlooks the intrinsic characteristics of diverse visual tasks and hinders the learning of perception capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a novel LMM architecture named Lumen, a Large multimodal model with versatile vision-centric capability enhancement. We decouple the LMM's learning of perception capabilities into task-agnostic and task-specific stages. Lumen first promotes fine-grained vision-language concept alignment, which is the fundamental capability for various visual tasks. Thus the output of the task-agnostic stage is a shared representation for all the tasks we address in this paper. Then the task-specific decoding is carried out by flexibly routing the shared representation to lightweight task decoders with negligible training efforts. Comprehensive experimental results on a series of vision-centric and VQA benchmarks indicate that our Lumen model not only achieves or surpasses the performance of existing LMM-based approaches in a range of vision-centric tasks while maintaining general visual understanding and instruction following capabilities."
Poster,Lumina-Next : Making Lumina-T2X Stronger and Faster with Next-DiT,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93994,"Le Zhuo, Ruoyi Du, Han Xiao, Yangguang Li, Dongyang Liu, Rongjie Huang, Wenze Liu, Xiangyang Zhu, Fu-Yun Wang, Zhanyu Ma, Xu Luo, Zehan Wang, Kaipeng Zhang, Lirui Zhao, Si Liu, Xiangyu Yue, Wanli Ouyang, Yu Qiao, Hongsheng Li, Peng Gao","Lumina-T2X is a nascent family of Flow-based Large Diffusion Transformers (Flag-DiT) that establishes a unified framework for transforming noise into various modalities, such as images and videos, conditioned on text instructions. Despite its promising capabilities, Lumina-T2X still encounters challenges including training instability, slow inference, and extrapolation artifacts. In this paper, we present Lumina-Next, an improved version of Lumina-T2X, showcasing stronger generation performance with increased training and inference efficiency. We begin with a comprehensive analysis of the Flag-DiT architecture and identify several suboptimal components, which we address by introducing the Next-DiT architecture with 3D RoPE and sandwich normalizations. To enable better resolution extrapolation, we thoroughly compare different context extrapolation methods applied to text-to-image generation with 3D RoPE, and propose Frequency- and Time-Aware Scaled RoPE tailored for diffusion transformers. Additionally, we introduce a sigmoid time discretization schedule for diffusion sampling, which achieves high-quality generation in 5-10 steps combined with higher-order ODE solvers. Thanks to these improvements, Lumina-Next not only improves the basic text-to-image generation but also demonstrates superior resolution extrapolation capabilities as well as multilingual generation using decoder-based LLMs as the text encoder, all in a zero-shot manner. To further validate Lumina-Next as a versatile generative framework, we instantiate it on diverse tasks including visual recognition, multi-views, audio, music, and point cloud generation, showcasing strong performance across these domains. By releasing all codes and model weights at https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-T2X, we aim to advance the development of next-generation generative AI capable of universal modeling."
Poster,LuSh-NeRF: Lighting up and Sharpening NeRFs for Low-light Scenes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96132,"Zefan Qu, Ke Xu, Gerhard Hancke, Rynson Lau","Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have shown remarkable performances in producing novel-view images from high-quality scene images. However, hand-held low-light photography challenges NeRFs as the captured images may simultaneously suffer from low visibility, noise, and camera shakes.While existing NeRF methods may handle either low light or motion, directly combining them or incorporating additional image-based enhancement methods does not work as these degradation factors are highly coupled.We observe that noise in low-light images is always sharp regardless of camera shakes, which implies an implicit order of these degradation factors within the image formation process.This inspires us to explore such an order to decouple and remove these degradation factors while training the NeRF.To this end, we propose in this paper a novel model, named LuSh-NeRF, which can reconstruct a clean and sharp NeRF from a group of hand-held low-light images.The key idea of LuSh-NeRF is to sequentially model noise and blur in the images via multi-view feature consistency and frequency information of NeRF, respectively.Specifically, LuSh-NeRF includes a novel Scene-Noise Decomposition (SND) module for decoupling the noise from the scene representation and a novel Camera Trajectory Prediction (CTP) module for the estimation of camera motions based on low-frequency scene information.To facilitate training and evaluations, we construct a new dataset containing both synthetic and real images.Experiments show that LuSh-NeRF outperforms existing approaches.

Poster,LVD-2M: A Long-take Video Dataset with Temporally Dense Captions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97774,"Tianwei Xiong, Yuqing Wang, Daquan Zhou, Zhijie Lin, Jiashi Feng, Xihui Liu","The efficacy of video generation models heavily depends on the quality of their training datasets. Most previous video generation models are trained on short video clips, while recently there has been increasing interest in training long video generation models directly on longer videos. However, the lack of such high-quality long videos impedes the advancement long video generation. To promote research in long video generation, we desire a new dataset with four key features essential for training long video generation models: (1) long videos covering at least 10 seconds, (2) long-take videos without cuts, (3) large motion and diverse contents, and (4) temporally dense captions. To achieve this, we introduce a new pipeline for filtering high-quality long-take videos and generating temporally dense captions. Specifically, we define a set of metrics to quantitatively assess video quality including scene cuts, dynamic degrees, and semantic-level scores, enabling us to filter high-quality long-take videos from a large amount of source videos. Subsequently, we develop a hierarchical video captioning pipeline to annotate long videos with temporally-dense captions. With this pipeline, we curate the first long-take video dataset, LVD-2M, comprising 2 million long-take videos, each covering more than 10 seconds and annotated with temporally dense captions. We further validate the effectiveness of LVD-2M by fine-tuning video generation models to generate long videos with dynamic motions. We believe it will significantly contribute to future research in long video generation."
Poster,"M$^3$GPT: An Advanced Multimodal, Multitask Framework  for Motion Comprehension and Generation",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95384,"Mingshuang Luo, RuiBing Hou, Zhuo Li, Hong Chang, Zimo Liu, Yaowei Wang, Shiguang Shan","This paper presents M$^3$GPT, an advanced $\textbf{M}$ultimodal, $\textbf{M}$ultitask  framework for $\textbf{M}$otion comprehension and generation.  M$^3$GPT operates on three fundamental principles. The first focuses on creating a unified representation space for various motion-relevant modalities. We employ discrete vector quantization for multimodal conditional signals, such as text, music and motion/dance, enabling seamless integration into a large language model (LLM) with a single vocabulary.The second involves modeling motion generation directly in the raw motion space. This strategy circumvents the information loss associated with a discrete tokenizer, resulting in more detailed and comprehensive motion generation. Third, M$^3$GPT learns to model the connections and synergies among various motion-relevant tasks. Text, the most familiar and well-understood modality for LLMs, is utilized as a bridge to establish connections between different motion tasks, facilitating mutual reinforcement. To our knowledge, M$^3$GPT is the first model capable of comprehending and generating motions based on multiple signals.Extensive experiments highlight M$^3$GPT's superior performance across various motion-relevant tasks and its powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities for extremely challenging tasks.
