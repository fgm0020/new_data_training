Poster,Motion Graph Unleashed: A Novel Approach to Video Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96622,"Yiqi Zhong, Luming Liang, Bohan Tang, Ilya Zharkov, Ulrich Neumann","We introduce motion graph, a novel approach to address the video prediction problem, i.e., predicting future video frames from limited past data. The motion graph transforms patches of video frames into interconnected graph nodes, to comprehensively describe the spatial-temporal relationships among them. This representation overcomes the limitations of existing motion representations such as image differences, optical flow, and motion matrix that either fall short in capturing complex motion patterns or suffer from excessive memory consumption. We further present a video prediction pipeline empowered by motion graph, exhibiting substantial performance improvements and cost reductions. Extensive experiments on various datasets, including UCF Sports, KITTI and Cityscapes, highlight the strong representative ability of motion graph. Especially on UCF Sports, our method matches and outperforms the SOTA methods with a significant reduction in model size by 78% and a substantial decrease in GPU memory utilization by 47%."
Poster,MotionGS: Exploring Explicit Motion Guidance for Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96538,"Ruijie Zhu, Yanzhe Liang, Hanzhi Chang, Jiacheng Deng, Jiahao Lu, Wenfei Yang, Tianzhu Zhang, Yongdong Zhang","Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in the field of 3D vision. Recently, the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting has provided new insights into this problem. Although subsequent efforts rapidly extend static 3D Gaussian to dynamic scenes, they often lack explicit constraints on object motion, leading to optimization difficulties and performance degradation. To address the above issues, we propose a novel deformable 3D Gaussian splatting framework called MotionGS, which explores explicit motion priors to guide the deformation of 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we first introduce an optical flow decoupling module that decouples optical flow into camera flow and motion flow, corresponding to camera movement and object motion respectively. Then the motion flow can effectively constrain the deformation of 3D Gaussians, thus simulating the motion of dynamic objects. Additionally, a camera pose refinement module is proposed to alternately optimize 3D Gaussians and camera poses, mitigating the impact of inaccurate camera poses. Extensive experiments in the monocular dynamic scenes validate that MotionGS surpasses state-of-the-art methods and exhibits significant superiority in both qualitative and quantitative results.

Poster,MotionTTT: 2D Test-Time-Training Motion Estimation for 3D Motion Corrected MRI,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94551,"Tobit Klug, Kun Wang, Stefan Ruschke, Reinhard Heckel","A major challenge of the long measurement times in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an important medical imaging technology, is that patients may move during data acquisition. This leads to severe motion artifacts in the reconstructed images and volumes. In this paper, we propose MotionTTT a deep learning-based test-time-training (TTT) method for accurate motion estimation. The key idea is that a neural network trained for motion-free reconstruction has a small loss if there is no motion, thus optimizing over motion parameters passed through the reconstruction network enables accurate estimation of motion. The estimated motion parameters enable to correct for the motion and to reconstruct accurate motion-corrected images. Our method uses 2D reconstruction networks to estimate rigid motion in 3D, and constitutes the first deep learning based method for 3D rigid motion estimation towards 3D-motion-corrected MRI. We show that our method can provably reconstruct motion parameters for a simple signal and neural network model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for both retrospectively simulated motion and prospectively collected real motion-corrupted data.

Poster,MOTIVE: A Drug-Target Interaction Graph For Inductive Link Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97758,"John Arevalo, Ellen Su, Anne Carpenter, Shantanu Singh","Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is crucial for identifying new therapeutics and detecting mechanisms of action. While structure-based methods accurately model physical interactions between a drug and its protein target, cell-based assays such as Cell Painting can better capture complex DTI interactions. This paper introduces MOTIVE, a Morphological cOmpound Target Interaction Graph dataset comprising Cell Painting features for 11,000 genes and 3,600 compounds, along with their relationships extracted from seven publicly available databases. We provide random, cold-source (new drugs), and cold-target (new genes) data splits to enable rigorous evaluation under realistic use cases. Our benchmark results show that graph neural networks that use Cell Painting features consistently outperform those that learn from graph structure alone, feature-based models, and topological heuristics. MOTIVE accelerates both graph ML research and drug discovery by promoting the development of more reliable DTI prediction models.

Poster,MoVA: Adapting Mixture of Vision Experts to Multimodal Context,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93279,"ZHUOFAN ZONG, Bingqi Ma, Dazhong Shen, Guanglu Song, Hao Shao, DONGZHI JIANG, Hongsheng Li, Yu Liu","As the key component in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the ability of the visual encoder greatly affects MLLM's understanding on diverse image content. Although some large-scale pretrained vision encoders such as vision encoders in CLIP and DINOv2 have brought promising performance, we found that there is still no single vision encoder that can dominate various image content understanding, e.g., the CLIP vision encoder leads to outstanding results on general image understanding but poor performance on document or chart content. To alleviate the bias of CLIP vision encoder, we first delve into the inherent behavior of different pre-trained vision encoders and then propose the MoVA, a powerful and novel MLLM, adaptively routing and fusing task-specific vision experts with a coarse-to-fine mechanism. In the coarse-grained stage, we design a context-aware expert routing strategy to dynamically select the most suitable vision experts according to the user instruction, input image, and expertise of vision experts. This benefits from the powerful model function understanding ability of the large language model (LLM). In the fine-grained stage, we elaborately conduct the mixture-of-vision-expert adapter (MoV-Adapter) to extract and fuse task-specific knowledge from various experts. This coarse-to-fine paradigm effectively leverages representations from experts based on multimodal context and model expertise, further enhancing the generalization ability. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Without any bells and whistles, MoVA can achieve significant performance gains over current state-of-the-art methods in a wide range of challenging multimodal benchmarks."
Poster,Moving Off-the-Grid: Scene-Grounded Video Representations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93419,"Sjoerd van Steenkiste, Daniel Zoran, Yi Yang, Yulia Rubanova, Rishabh Kabra, Carl Doersch, Dilara Gokay, joseph heyward, Etienne Pot, Klaus Greff, Drew Hudson, Thomas Keck, Joao Carreira, Alexey Dosovitskiy, Mehdi S. M. Sajjadi, Thomas Kipf","Current vision models typically maintain a fixed correspondence between their representation structure and image space.Each layer comprises a set of tokens arranged “on-the-grid,” which biases patches or tokens to encode information at a specific spatio(-temporal) location. In this work we present *Moving Off-the-Grid* (MooG), a self-supervised video representation model that offers an alternative approach, allowing tokens to move “off-the-grid” to better enable them to represent scene elements consistently, even as they move across the image plane through time. By using a combination of cross-attention and positional embeddings we disentangle the representation structure and image structure. We find that a simple self-supervised objective—next frame prediction—trained on video data, results in a set of latent tokens which bind to specific scene structures and track them as they move. We demonstrate the usefulness of MooG’s learned representation both qualitatively and quantitatively by training readouts on top of the learned representation on a variety of downstream tasks. We show that MooG can provide a strong foundation for different vision tasks when compared to “on-the-grid” baselines."
Poster,MR-Ben: A Meta-Reasoning Benchmark for Evaluating System-2 Thinking in LLMs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95909,"Zhongshen Zeng, Yinhong Liu, Yingjia Wan, Jingyao Li, Pengguang Chen, Jianbo Dai, Yuxuan Yao, Rongwu Xu, Zehan Qi, Wanru Zhao, Linling Shen, Jianqiao Lu, Haochen Tan, Yukang Chen, Hao Zhang, Zhan Shi, Bailin Wang, Zhijiang Guo, Jiaya Jia","Large language models (LLMs) have shown increasing capability in problem-solving and decision-making, largely based on the step-by-step chain-of-thought reasoning processes. However, evaluating these reasoning abilities has become increasingly challenging. Existing outcome-based benchmarks are beginning to saturate, becoming less effective in tracking meaningful progress. To address this, we present a process-based benchmark MR-Ben that demands a meta-reasoning skill, where LMs are asked to locate and analyse potential errors in automatically generated reasoning steps. Our meta-reasoning paradigm is especially suited for system-2 slow thinking, mirroring the human cognitive process of carefully examining assumptions, conditions, calculations, and logic to identify mistakes. MR-Ben comprises 5,975 questions curated by human experts across a wide range of subjects, including physics, chemistry, logic, coding, and more. Through our designed metrics for assessing meta-reasoning on this benchmark, we identify interesting limitations and weaknesses of current LLMs (open-source and closed-source models). For example, with models like the o1 series from OpenAI demonstrating strong performance by effectively scrutinizing the solution space, many other state-of-the-art models fall significantly behind on MR-Ben, exposing potential shortcomings in their training strategies and inference methodologies."
Poster,MSA Generation with Seqs2Seqs Pretraining: Advancing Protein Structure Predictions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96109,"LE ZHANG, Jiayang Chen, Tao Shen, Yu Li, Siqi Sun","Deep learning models like AlphaFold2 have revolutionized protein structure prediction, achieving unprecedented accuracy. However, the dependence on robust multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) continues to pose a challenge, especially for proteins that lack a wealth of homologous sequences. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MSA-Generator, a self-supervised generative protein language model. Trained on a sequence-to-sequence task using an automatically constructed dataset, MSA-Generator employs protein-specific attention mechanisms to harness large-scale protein databases, generating virtual MSAs that enrich existing ones and boost prediction accuracy. Our experiments on CASP14 and CASP15 benchmarks reveal significant improvements in LDDT scores, particularly for complex and challenging sequences, enhancing the performance of both AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold. The code is released at \url{https://github.com/lezhang7/MSAGen}."
Poster,MSAGPT: Neural Prompting Protein Structure Prediction via MSA Generative Pre-Training,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93555,"Bo Chen, Zhilei Bei, Xingyi Cheng, Pan Li, Jie Tang, Le Song","Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) plays a pivotal role in unveiling the evolutionary trajectories of protein families. The accuracy of protein structure predictions is often compromised for protein sequences that lack sufficient homologous information to construct high-quality MSA. Although various methods have been proposed to generate high-quality MSA under these conditions, they fall short in comprehensively capturing the intricate co-evolutionary patterns within MSA or require guidance from external oracle models. Here we introduce MSAGPT, a novel approach to prompt protein structure predictions via MSA generative pre-training in a low-MSA regime. MSAGPT employs a simple yet effective 2D evolutionary positional encoding scheme to model the complex evolutionary patterns. Endowed by this, the flexible 1D MSA decoding framework facilitates zero- or few-shot learning. Moreover, we demonstrate leveraging the feedback from AlphaFold2 (AF2) can further enhance the model’s capacity via Rejective Fine-tuning (RFT) and Reinforcement Learning from AF2 Feedback (RLAF). Extensive experiments confirm the efficacy of MSAGPT in generating faithful and informative MSA (up to +8.5% TM-Score on few-shot scenarios). The transfer learning also demonstrates its great potential for the wide range of tasks resorting to the quality of MSA."
Poster,MSPE: Multi-Scale Patch Embedding Prompts Vision Transformers to Any Resolution,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96311,"Wenzhuo Liu, Fei Zhu, Shijie Ma, Cheng-lin Liu","Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently advanced computer vision tasks significantly, an important real-world problem was overlooked: adapting to variable input resolutions. Typically, images are resized to a fixed resolution, such as 224x224, for efficiency during training and inference. However, uniform input size conflicts with real-world scenarios where images naturally vary in resolution. Modifying the preset resolution of a model may severely degrade the performance. In this work, we propose to enhance the model adaptability to resolution variation by optimizing the patch embedding. The proposed method, called Multi-Scale Patch Embedding (MSPE), substitutes the standard patch embedding with multiple variable-sized patch kernels and selects the best parameters for different resolutions, eliminating the need to resize the original image. Our method does not require high-cost training or modifications to other parts, making it easy to apply to most ViT models. Experiments in image classification, segmentation, and detection tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of MSPE, yielding superior performance on low-resolution inputs and performing comparably on high-resolution inputs with existing methods."
