Poster,GVKF: Gaussian Voxel Kernel Functions for Highly Efficient Surface Reconstruction in Open Scenes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96090,"Gaochao Song, Chong Cheng, Hao Wang","In this paper we present a novel method for efficient and effective 3D surface reconstruction in open scenes. Existing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) based works typically require extensive training and rendering time due to the adopted implicit representations. In contrast, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) uses an explicit and discrete representation, hence the reconstructed surface is built by the huge number of Gaussian primitives, which leads to excessive memory consumption and rough surface details in sparse Gaussian areas.To address these issues, we propose Gaussian Voxel Kernel Functions (GVKF), which establish a continuous scene representation based on discrete 3DGS through kernel regression. The GVKF integrates fast 3DGS rasterization and highly effective scene implicit representations, achieving high-fidelity open scene surface reconstruction. Experiments on challenging scene datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed GVKF, featuring with high reconstruction quality, real-time rendering speed, significant savings in storage and training memory consumption."
Poster,GV-Rep: A Large-Scale Dataset for Genetic Variant Representation Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97813,"Zehui Li, Vallijah Subasri, Guy-Bart Stan, Yiren Zhao, Bo Wang","Genetic variants (GVs) are defined as differences in the DNA sequences among individuals and play a crucial role in diagnosing and treating genetic diseases. The rapid decrease in next generation sequencing cost, analogous to Moore’s Law, has led to an exponential increase in the availability of patient-level GV data. This growth poses a challenge for clinicians who must efficiently prioritize patient-specific GVs and integrate them with existing genomic databases to inform patient management. To addressing the interpretation of GVs, genomic foundation models (GFMs) have emerged. However, these models lack standardized performance assessments, leading to considerable variability in model evaluations. This poses the question: *How effectively do deep learning methods classify unknown GVs and align them with clinically-verified GVs?* We argue that representation learning, which transforms raw data into meaningful feature spaces, is an effective approach for addressing both indexing and classification challenges. We introduce a large-scale Genetic Variant dataset, named $\textsf{GV-Rep}$, featuring variable-length contexts and detailed annotations, designed for deep learning models to learn GV representations across various traits, diseases, tissue types, and experimental contexts. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) $\textbf{Construction}$ of a comprehensive dataset with 7 million records, each labeled with characteristics of the corresponding variants, alongside additional data from 17,548 gene knockout tests across 1,107 cell types, 1,808 variant combinations, and 156 unique clinically-verified GVs from real-world patients. (ii) $\textbf{Analysis}$ of the structure and properties of the dataset. (iii) $\textbf{Experimentation}$ of the dataset with pre-trained genomic foundation models (GFMs). The results highlight a significant disparity between the current capabilities of GFMs and the accurate representation of GVs. We hope this dataset will advance genomic deep learning to bridge this gap."
Poster,HairDiffusion: Vivid Multi-Colored Hair Editing via Latent Diffusion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94970,"Yu Zeng, Yang Zhang, Liu Jiachen, Linlin Shen, Kaijun Deng, Weizhao He, Jinbao Wang","Hair editing is a critical image synthesis task that aims to edit hair color and hairstyle using text descriptions or reference images, while preserving irrelevant attributes (e.g., identity, background, cloth). Many existing methods are based on StyleGAN to address this task. However, due to the limited spatial distribution of StyleGAN, it struggles with multiple hair color editing and facial preservation. Considering the advancements in diffusion models, we utilize Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for hairstyle editing. Our approach introduces Multi-stage Hairstyle Blend (MHB), effectively separating control of hair color and hairstyle in diffusion latent space. Additionally, we train a warping module to align the hair color with the target region. To further enhance multi-color hairstyle editing, we fine-tuned a CLIP model using a multi-color hairstyle dataset. Our method not only tackles the complexity of multi-color hairstyles but also addresses the challenge of preserving original colors during diffusion editing. Extensive experiments showcase the superiority of our method in editing multi-color hairstyles while preserving facial attributes given textual descriptions and reference images."
Poster,HairFastGAN: Realistic and Robust Hair Transfer with a Fast Encoder-Based Approach,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93397,"Maxim Nikolaev, Mikhail Kuznetsov, Dmitry Vetrov, Aibek Alanov","Our paper addresses the complex task of transferring a hairstyle from a reference image to an input photo for virtual hair try-on. This task is challenging due to the need to adapt to various photo poses, the sensitivity of hairstyles, and the lack of objective metrics. The current state of the art hairstyle transfer methods use an optimization process for different parts of the approach, making them inexcusably slow. At the same time, faster encoder-based models are of very low quality because they either operate in StyleGAN's W+ space or use other low-dimensional image generators. Additionally, both approaches have a problem with hairstyle transfer when the source pose is very different from the target pose, because they either don't consider the pose at all or deal with it inefficiently. In our paper, we present the HairFast model, which uniquely solves these problems and achieves high resolution, near real-time performance, and superior reconstruction compared to optimization problem-based methods. Our solution includes a new architecture operating in the FS latent space of StyleGAN, an enhanced inpainting approach, and improved encoders for better alignment, color transfer, and a new encoder for post-processing. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on realism metrics after random hairstyle transfer and reconstruction when the original hairstyle is transferred. In the most difficult scenario of transferring both shape and color of a hairstyle from different images, our method performs in less than a second on the Nvidia V100."
Poster,Hallo3D: Multi-Modal Hallucination Detection and Mitigation for Consistent 3D Content Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93528,"Hongbo Wang, Jie Cao, Jin Liu, Xiaoqiang Zhou, Huaibo Huang, Ran He","Recent advancements in 3D content generation have been significant, primarily due to the visual priors provided by pretrained diffusion models. However, large 2D visual models exhibit spatial perception hallucinations, leading to multi-view inconsistency in 3D content generated through Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). This phenomenon, characterized by overfitting to specific views, is referred to as the ""Janus Problem"". In this work, we investigate the hallucination issues of pretrained models and find that large multimodal models without geometric constraints possess the capability to infer geometric structures, which can be utilized to mitigate multi-view inconsistency. Building on this, we propose a novel tuning-free method. We represent the multimodal inconsistency query information to detect specific hallucinations in 3D content, using this as an enhanced prompt to re-consist the 2D renderings of 3D and jointly optimize the structure and appearance across different views. Our approach does not require 3D training data and can be implemented plug-and-play within existing frameworks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the consistency of 3D content generation and specifically mitigates hallucinations caused by pretrained large models, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to other optimization methods."
Poster,HaloScope: Harnessing Unlabeled LLM Generations for Hallucination Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93676,"Xuefeng Du, Chaowei Xiao, Sharon Li","The surge in applications of large language models (LLMs) has prompted concerns about the generation of misleading or fabricated information, known as hallucinations. Therefore, detecting hallucinations has become critical to maintaining trust in LLM-generated content. A primary challenge in learning a truthfulness classifier is the lack of a large amount of labeled truthful and hallucinated data. To address the challenge, we introduce HaloScope, a novel learning framework that leverages the unlabeled LLM generations in the wild for hallucination detection. Such unlabeled data arises freely upon deploying LLMs in the open world, and consists of both truthful and hallucinated information. To harness the unlabeled data, we present an automated scoring function for distinguishing between truthful and untruthful generations within unlabeled mixture data, thereby enabling the training of a binary classifier on top. Importantly, our framework does not require extra data collection and human annotations, offering strong flexibility and practicality for real-world applications. Extensive experiments show that HaloScope can achieve superior hallucination detection performance, outperforming the competitive rivals by a significant margin."
Poster,Hamba: Single-view 3D Hand Reconstruction with Graph-guided Bi-Scanning Mamba,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93574,"Haoye Dong, Aviral Chharia, Wenbo Gou, Francisco Vicente Carrasco, Fernando D De la Torre","3D Hand reconstruction from a single RGB image is challenging due to the articulated motion, self-occlusion, and interaction with objects. Existing SOTA methods employ attention-based transformers to learn the 3D hand pose and shape, yet they do not fully achieve robust and accurate performance, primarily due to inefficiently modeling spatial relations between joints. To address this problem, we propose a novel graph-guided Mamba framework, named Hamba, which bridges graph learning and state space modeling. Our core idea is to reformulate Mamba's scanning into graph-guided bidirectional scanning for 3D reconstruction using a few effective tokens. This enables us to efficiently learn the spatial relationships between joints for improving reconstruction performance. Specifically, we design a Graph-guided State Space (GSS) block that learns the graph-structured relations and spatial sequences of joints and uses 88.5\% fewer tokens than attention-based methods. Additionally, we integrate the state space features and the global features using a fusion module. By utilizing the GSS block and the fusion module, Hamba effectively leverages the graph-guided state space features and jointly considers global and local features to improve performance. Experiments on several benchmarks and in-the-wild tests demonstrate that Hamba significantly outperforms existing SOTAs, achieving the PA-MPVPE of 5.3mm and F@15mm of 0.992 on FreiHAND. At the time of this paper's acceptance, Hamba holds the top position, Rank 1, in two competition leaderboards on 3D hand reconstruction."
Poster,Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Inference of Marginalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93269,"Jinlin Lai, Justin Domke, Daniel Sheldon","Bayesian reasoning in linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) is challenging and often requires advanced sampling techniques like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).A common approach is to write the model in a probabilistic programming language and then sample via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC).However, there are many ways a user can transform a model that make inference more or less efficient.In particular, marginalizing some variables can greatly improve inference but is difficult for users to do manually.We develop an algorithm to easily marginalize random effects in LMMs.A naive approach introduces cubic time operations within an inference algorithm like HMC, but we reduce the running time to linear using fast linear algebra techniques.We show that marginalization is always beneficial when applicable and highlight improvements in various models, especially ones from cognitive sciences."
Poster,Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on ReLU Neural Networks is Inefficient,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94581,"Vu Dinh, Lam Ho, Cuong V. Nguyen","We analyze the error rates of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm with leapfrog integrator for Bayesian neural network inference. We show that due to the non-differentiability of activation functions in the ReLU family, leapfrog HMC for networks with these activation functions has a large local error rate of $\Omega(\epsilon)$ rather than the classical error rate of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^3)$. This leads to a higher rejection rate of the proposals, making the method inefficient. We then verify our theoretical findings through empirical simulations as well as experiments on a real-world dataset that highlight the inefficiency of HMC inference on ReLU-based neural networks compared to analytical networks."
Poster,Hamiltonian Score Matching and Generative Flows,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95722,"Peter Holderrieth, Yilun Xu, Tommi Jaakkola","Classical Hamiltonian mechanics has been widely used in machine learning in the form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for applications with predetermined force fields. In this paper, we explore the potential of deliberately designing force fields for Hamiltonian systems, introducing Hamiltonian velocity predictors (HVPs) as a core tool for constructing energy-based and generative models. We present two innovations: Hamiltonian Score Matching (HSM), which utilizes score functions to augment data by simulating Hamiltonian trajectories, and Hamiltonian Generative Flows (HGFs), a novel generative model that encompasses diffusion models and OT-flow matching as HGFs with zero force fields. We showcase the extended design space of force fields by introducing Oscillation HGFs, a generative model inspired by harmonic oscillators. Our experiments demonstrate that HSM and HGFs rival leading score-matching and generative modeling techniques. Overall, our work systematically elucidates the synergy between Hamiltonian dynamics, force fields, and generative models, thereby opening new avenues for applications of machine learning in physical sciences and dynamical systems."
