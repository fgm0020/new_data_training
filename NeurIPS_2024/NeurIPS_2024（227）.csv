Poster,Learning Segmentation from Point Trajectories,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93186,"Laurynas Karazija, Iro Laina, Christian Rupprecht, Andrea Vedaldi","We consider the problem of segmenting objects in videos based on their motion and no other forms of supervision. Prior work has often approached this problem by using the principle of common fate, namely the fact that the motion of points that belong to the same object is strongly correlated. However, most authors have only considered instantaneous motion from optical flow. In this work, we present a way to train a segmentation network using long-term point trajectories as a supervisory signal to complement optical flow. The key difficulty is that long-term motion, unlike instantaneous motion, is difficult to model -- any parametric approximation is unlikely to capture complex motion patterns over long periods of time. We instead draw inspiration from subspace clustering approaches, proposing a loss function that seeks to group the trajectories into low-rank matrices where the motion of object points can be approximately explained as a linear combination of other point tracks. Our method outperforms the prior art on motion-based segmentation, which shows the utility of long-term motion and the effectiveness of our formulation."
Poster,Learning Social Welfare Functions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96456,"Kanad Pardeshi, Itai Shapira, Ariel Procaccia, Aarti Singh","Is it possible to understand or imitate a policy maker's rationale by looking at past decisions they made? We formalize this question as the problem of learning social welfare functions belonging to the well-studied family of power mean functions. We focus on two learning tasks; in the first, the input is vectors of utilities of an action (decision or policy) for individuals in a group and their associated social welfare as judged by a policy maker, whereas in the second, the input is pairwise comparisons between the welfares associated with a given pair of utility vectors. We show that power mean functions are learnable with polynomial sample complexity in both cases, even if the social welfare information is noisy. Finally, we design practical algorithms for these tasks and evaluate their performance."
Poster,Learning Spatially-Aware Language and Audio Embeddings,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93168,"Bhavika Devnani, Skyler Seto, Zakaria Aldeneh, Alessandro Toso, Elena Menyaylenko, Barry-John Theobald, Jonathan Sheaffer, Miguel Sarabia","Humans can picture a sound scene given an imprecise natural language description. For example, it is easy to imagine an acoustic environment given a phrase like ""the lion roar came from right behind me!"". For a machine to have the same degree of comprehension,  the machine must know what a lion is (semantic attribute), what the concept of ""behind"" is (spatial attribute) and how these pieces of linguistic information align with the semantic and spatial attributes of the sound (what a roar sounds like when its coming from behind). State-of-the-art audio foundation models, such as CLAP, which learn to map between audio scenes and natural textual descriptions, are trained on non-spatial audio and text pairs, and hence lack spatial awareness. In contrast, sound event localization and detection models are limited to recognizing sounds from a fixed number of classes, and they localize the source to absolute position (e.g., 0.2m) rather than a position described using natural language (e.g., ""next to me""). To address these gaps, we present ELSA (Embeddings for Language and Spatial Audio), a spatially aware-audio and text embedding model trained using multimodal contrastive learning. ELSA supports non-spatial audio, spatial audio, and open vocabulary text captions describing both the spatial and semantic components of sound. To train ELSA: (a) we spatially augment  the audio and captions of three open-source audio datasets totaling 4,738 hours and 890,038 samples of audio comprised from 8,972 simulated spatial configurations, and (b) we design an encoder to capture the semantics of non-spatial audio, and the semantics and spatial attributes of spatial audio using contrastive learning. ELSA is a single model that is competitive with state-of-the-art for both semantic retrieval and 3D source localization.  In particular, ELSA achieves +2.8\% mean audio-to-text and text-to-audio R@1 above the LAION-CLAP baseline, and outperforms by -11.6° mean-absolute-error in 3D source localization over the SeldNET baseline on the TUT Sound Events 2018 benchmark. Moreover, we show that the representation-space of ELSA is structured, enabling swapping of direction of audio via vector arithmetic of two directional text embeddings."
Poster,Learning Structure-Aware Representations of Dependent Types,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94299,"Konstantinos Kogkalidis, Orestis Melkonian, Jean-Philippe Bernardy","Agda is a dependently-typed programming language and a proof assistant, pivotal in proof formalization and programming language theory.This paper extends the Agda ecosystem into machine learning territory, and, vice versa, makes Agda-related resources available to machine learning practitioners.We introduce and release a novel dataset of Agda program-proofs that is elaborate and extensive enough to support various machine learning applications -- the first of its kind.Leveraging the dataset's ultra-high resolution, which details proof states at the sub-type level, we propose a novel neural architecture targeted at faithfully representing dependently-typed programs on the basis of structural rather than nominal principles.We instantiate and evaluate our architecture in a premise selection setup, where it achieves promising initial results, surpassing strong baselines."
Poster,Learning Structured Representations with Hyperbolic Embeddings,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93170,"Aditya Sinha, Siqi Zeng, Makoto Yamada, Han Zhao","Most real-world datasets consist of a natural hierarchy between classes or an inherent label structure that is either already available or can be constructed cheaply. However, most existing representation learning methods ignore this hierarchy, treating labels as permutation invariant. Recent work [Zeng et al., 2022] proposes using this structured information explicitly, but the use of Euclidean distance may distort the underlying semantic context [Chen et al., 2013]. In this work, motivated by the advantage of hyperbolic spaces in modeling hierarchical relationships, we propose a novel approach HypStructure: a Hyperbolic Structured regularization approach to accurately embed the label hierarchy into the learned representations. HypStructure is a simple-yet-effective regularizer that consists of a hyperbolic tree-based representation loss along with a centering loss, and can be combined with any standard task loss to learn hierarchy-informed features. Extensive experiments on several large-scale vision benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of HypStructure in reducing distortion and boosting generalization performance especially under low dimensional scenarios. For a better understanding of structured representation, we perform eigenvalue analysis that links the representation geometry to improved Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection performance seen empirically."
Poster,Learning Successor Features the Simple Way,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93447,"Raymond Chua, Arna Ghosh, Christos Kaplanis, Blake Richards, Doina Precup","In Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), it is a challenge to learn representations that do not exhibit catastrophic forgetting or interference in non-stationary environments. Successor Features (SFs) offer a potential solution to this challenge. However, canonical techniques for learning SFs from pixel-level observations often lead to representation collapse, wherein representations degenerate and fail to capture meaningful variations in the data. More recent methods for learning SFs can avoid representation collapse, but they often involve complex losses and multiple learning phases, reducing their efficiency. We introduce a novel, simple method for learning SFs directly from pixels. Our approach uses a combination of a Temporal-difference (TD) loss and a reward prediction loss, which together capture the basic mathematical definition of SFs.  We show that our approach matches or outperforms existing SF learning techniques in both 2D (Minigrid) and 3D (Miniworld) mazes, for both single and continual learning scenarios. As well, our technique is efficient, and can reach higher levels of performance in less time than other approaches. Our work provides a new, streamlined technique for learning SFs directly from pixel observations, with no pretraining required."
Poster,Learning Superconductivity from Ordered and Disordered Material Structures,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97553,"Pin Chen, Luoxuan Peng, Rui Jiao, Qing Mo, Zhen Wang, Wenbing Huang, Yang Liu, Yutong Lu","Superconductivity is a fascinating phenomenon observed in certain materials under certain conditions. However, some critical aspects of it, such as the relationship between superconductivity and materials' chemical/structural features, still need to be understood. Recent successes of data-driven approaches in material science strongly inspire researchers to study this relationship with them, but a corresponding dataset is still lacking. Hence, we present a new dataset for data-driven approaches, namely SuperCon3D, containing both 3D crystal structures and experimental superconducting transition temperature (Tc) for the first time. Based on SuperCon3D, we propose two deep learning methods for designing high Tc superconductors. The first is SODNet, a novel equivariant graph attention model for screening known structures, which differs from existing models in incorporating both ordered and disordered geometric content. The second is a diffusion generative model DiffCSP-SC for creating new structures, which enables high Tc-targeted generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both our proposed dataset and models are advantageous for designing new high Tc superconducting candidates."
Poster,Learning symmetries via weight-sharing with doubly stochastic tensors,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96699,"Putri van der Linden, Alejandro García-Castellanos, Sharvaree Vadgama, Thijs Kuipers, Erik Bekkers","Group equivariance has emerged as a valuable inductive bias in deep learning, enhancing generalization, data efficiency, and robustness. Classically, group equivariant methods require the groups of interest to be known beforehand, which may not be realistic for real-world data. Additionally, baking in fixed group equivariance may impose overly restrictive constraints on model architecture. This highlights the need for methods that can dynamically discover and apply symmetries as soft constraints. For neural network architectures, equivariance is commonly achieved through group transformations of a canonical weight tensor, resulting in weight sharing over a given group $G$. In this work, we propose to *learn* such a weight-sharing scheme by defining a collection of learnable doubly stochastic matrices that act as soft permutation matrices on canonical weight tensors, which can take regular group representations as a special case. This yields learnable kernel transformations that are jointly optimized with downstream tasks. We show that when the dataset exhibits strong symmetries, the permutation matrices will converge to regular group representations and our weight-sharing networks effectively become regular group convolutions. Additionally, the flexibility of the method enables it to effectively pick up on partial symmetries."
Poster,Learning the Expected Core of Strictly Convex Stochastic Cooperative Games,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94637,"Phuong Nam Tran, The Anh Ta, shuqing shi, Debmalya Mandal, Yali Du, Long Tran-Thanh","Reward allocation, also known as the credit assignment problem, has been an important topic in economics, engineering, and machine learning. An important concept in reward allocation is the core, which is the set of stable allocations where no agent has the motivation to deviate from the grand coalition. In previous works, computing the core requires either knowledge of the reward function in deterministic games or the reward distribution in stochastic games. However, this is unrealistic, as the reward function or distribution is often only partially known and may be subject to uncertainty. In this paper, we consider the core learning problem in stochastic cooperative games, where the reward distribution is unknown. Our goal is to learn the expected core, that is, the set of allocations that are stable in expectation, given an oracle that returns a stochastic reward for an enquired coalition each round. Within the class of strictly convex games, we present an algorithm named \texttt{Common-Points-Picking} that returns a point in the expected core given a polynomial number of samples, with high probability. To analyse the algorithm, we develop a new extension of the separation hyperplane theorem for multiple convex sets.t."
Poster,Learning the Infinitesimal Generator of Stochastic Diffusion Processes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95855,"Vladimir Kostic, Hélène Halconruy, Timothée Devergne, Karim Lounici, Massimiliano Pontil","We address data-driven learning of the infinitesimal generator of stochastic diffusion processes, essential for understanding numerical simulations of natural and physical systems. The unbounded nature of the generator poses significant challenges, rendering conventional analysis techniques for Hilbert-Schmidt operators ineffective. To overcome this, we introduce a novel framework based on the energy functional for these stochastic processes. Our approach integrates physical priors through an energy-based risk metric in both full and partial knowledge settings. We evaluate the statistical performance of a reduced-rank estimator in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) in the partial knowledge setting. Notably, our approach provides learning bounds independent of the state space dimension and ensures non-spurious spectral estimation. Additionally, we elucidate how the distortion between the intrinsic energy-induced metric of the stochastic diffusion and the RKHS metric used for generator estimation impacts the spectral learning bounds."
