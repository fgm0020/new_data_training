Poster,Latent Functional Maps: a spectral framework for representation alignment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93741,"Marco Fumero, Marco Pegoraro, Valentino Maiorca, Francesco Locatello, Emanuele Rodolà","Neural models learn data representations that lie on low-dimensional manifolds, yet modeling the relation between these representational spaces is an ongoing challenge.By integrating spectral geometry principles into neural modeling, we show that this problem can be better addressed in the functional domain, mitigating complexity, while enhancing interpretability and performances on downstream tasks. To this end, we introduce a multi-purpose framework to the representation learning community, which allows to: (i) compare different spaces in an interpretable way and measure their intrinsic similarity; (ii) find correspondences between them, both in unsupervised and weakly supervised settings, and (iii) to effectively transfer representations between distinct spaces.We validate our framework on various applications, ranging from stitching to retrieval tasks, and on multiple modalities, demonstrating that Latent Functional Maps can serve as a swiss-army knife for representation alignment."
Poster,Latent Intrinsics Emerge from Training to Relight,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93795,"Xiao Zhang, William Gao, Seemandhar Jain, Michael Maire, David Forsyth, Anand Bhattad","Image relighting is the task of showing what a scene from a source image would look like if illuminated differently.  Inverse graphic schemes recover an explicit representation of geometry and a set of chosen intrinsics, then relight with some form of renderer.  But error control for inverse graphics is difficult, and inverse graphics methods can represent only the effects of the chosen intrinsics. This paper describes a relighting method that is entirely data-driven, where intrinsics and lighting are each represented as latent variables.  Our approach produces SOTA relightings of real scenes, as measured by standard metrics.  We show that albedo can be recovered from our latent intrinsics without using any example albedos, and that the albedos recovered are competitive with SOTA methods."
Poster,Latent Learning Progress Drives Autonomous Goal Selection in Human Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95893,"Gaia Molinaro, Cédric Colas, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer, Anne Collins","Humans are autotelic agents who learn by setting and pursuing their own goals. However, the precise mechanisms guiding human goal selection remain unclear. Learning progress, typically measured as the observed change in performance, can provide a valuable signal for goal selection in both humans and artificial agents. We hypothesize that human choices of goals may also be driven by _latent learning progress_, which humans can estimate through knowledge of their actions and the environment – even without experiencing immediate changes in performance. To test this hypothesis, we designed a hierarchical reinforcement learning task in which human participants (N = 175) repeatedly chose their own goals and learned goal-conditioned policies. Our behavioral and computational modeling results confirm the influence of latent learning progress on goal selection and uncover inter-individual differences, partially mediated by recognition of the task's hierarchical structure. By investigating the role of latent learning progress in human goal selection, we pave the way for more effective and personalized learning experiences as well as the advancement of more human-like autotelic machines."
Poster,Latent Neural Operator for Solving Forward and Inverse PDE Problems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94908,"Tian Wang, Chuang Wang","Neural operators effectively solve PDE problems from data without knowing the explicit equations, which learn the map from the input sequences of observed samples to the predicted values. Most existing works build the model in the original geometric space, leading to high computational costs when the number of sample points is large. We present the Latent Neural Operator (LNO) solving PDEs in the latent space. In particular, we first propose Physics-Cross-Attention (PhCA) transforming representation from the geometric space to the latent space, then learn the operator in the latent space, and finally recover the real-world geometric space via the inverse PhCA map. Our model retains flexibility that can decode values in any position not limited to locations defined in the training set, and therefore can naturally perform interpolation and extrapolation tasks particularly useful for inverse problems. Moreover, the proposed LNO improves both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Experiments show that LNO reduces the GPU memory by 50%, speeds up training 1.8 times, and reaches state-of-the-art accuracy on four out of six benchmarks for forward problems and a benchmark for inverse problem.

Poster,Latent Paraphrasing: Perturbation on Layers Improves Knowledge Injection in Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95060,"Minki Kang, Sung Ju Hwang, Gibbeum Lee, Jaewoong Cho","As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in specialized domains with continuously evolving knowledge, the need for timely and precise knowledge injection has become essential. Fine-tuning with paraphrased data is a common approach to enhance knowledge injection, yet it faces two significant challenges: high computational costs due to repetitive external model usage and limited sample diversity. To this end, we introduce LaPael, a latent-level paraphrasing method that applies input-dependent noise to early LLM layers.This approach enables diverse and semantically consistent augmentations directly within the model. Furthermore, it eliminates the recurring costs of paraphrase generation for each knowledge update. Our extensive experiments on question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that LaPael improves knowledge injection over standard fine-tuning and existing noise-based approaches. Additionally, combining LaPael with data-level paraphrasing further enhances performance."
Poster,Latent Plan Transformer for Trajectory Abstraction: Planning as Latent Space Inference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96937,"Deqian Kong, Dehong Xu, Minglu Zhao, Bo Pang, Jianwen Xie, Andrew Lizarraga, Yuhao Huang, Sirui Xie, Ying Nian Wu","In tasks aiming for long-term returns, planning becomes essential. We study generative modeling for planning with datasets repurposed from offline reinforcement learning. Specifically, we identify temporal consistency in the absence of step-wise rewards as one key technical challenge. We introduce the Latent Plan Transformer (LPT), a novel model that leverages a latent variable to connect a Transformer- based trajectory generator and the final return. LPT can be learned with maximum likelihood estimation on trajectory-return pairs. In learning, posterior sampling of the latent variable naturally integrates sub-trajectories to form a consistent abstrac- tion despite the finite context. At test time, the latent variable is inferred from an expected return before policy execution, realizing the idea of planning as inference. Our experiments demonstrate that LPT can discover improved decisions from sub- optimal trajectories, achieving competitive performance across several benchmarks, including Gym-Mujoco, Franka Kitchen, Maze2D, and Connect Four. It exhibits capabilities in nuanced credit assignments, trajectory stitching, and adaptation to environmental contingencies. These results validate that latent variable inference can be a strong alternative to step-wise reward prompting."
Poster,Latent Representation Matters: Human-like Sketches in One-shot Drawing Tasks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93325,"Victor Boutin, Rishav Mukherji, Aditya Agrawal, Sabine Muzellec, Thomas Fel, Thomas Serre, Rufin VanRullen","Humans can effortlessly draw new categories from a single exemplar, a feat that has long posed a challenge for generative models. However, this gap has started to close with recent advances in diffusion models. This one-shot drawing task requires powerful inductive biases that have not been systematically investigated. Here, we study how different inductive biases shape the latent space of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). Along with standard LDM regularizers (KL and vector quantization), we explore supervised regularizations (including classification and prototype-based representation) and contrastive inductive biases (using  SimCLR and redundancy reduction objectives). We demonstrate that LDMs with redundancy reduction and prototype-based regularizations produce near-human-like drawings (regarding both samples' recognizability and originality) -- better mimicking human perception (as evaluated psychophysically). Overall, our results suggest that the gap between humans and machines in one-shot drawings is almost closed."
Poster,LAVIB: A Large-scale Video Interpolation Benchmark,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97840,Alex Stergiou,"This paper introduces a LArge-scale Video Interpolation Benchmark (LAVIB) for the low-level video task of Video Frame Interpolation (VFI). LAVIB comprises a large collection of high-resolution videos sourced from the web through an automated pipeline with minimal requirements for human verification. Metrics are computed for each video's motion magnitudes, luminance conditions, frame sharpness, and contrast. The collection of videos and the creation of quantitative challenges based on these metrics are under-explored by current low-level video task datasets. In total, LAVIB includes 283K clips from 17K ultra-HD videos, covering 77.6 hours. Benchmark train, val, and test sets maintain similar video metric distributions. Further splits are also created for out-of-distribution (OOD) challenges, with train and test splits including videos of dissimilar attributes."
Poster,Layer-Adaptive State Pruning for Deep State Space Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95053,"Minseon Gwak, Seongrok Moon, Joohwan Ko, PooGyeon Park","Due to the lack of state dimension optimization methods, deep state space models (SSMs) have sacrificed model capacity, training search space, or stability to alleviate computational costs caused by high state dimensions. In this work, we provide a structured pruning method for SSMs, Layer-Adaptive STate pruning (LAST), which reduces the state dimension of each layer in minimizing model-level output energy loss by extending modal truncation for a single system. LAST scores are evaluated using the $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ norms of subsystems and layer-wise energy normalization. The scores serve as global pruning criteria, enabling cross-layer comparison of states and layer-adaptive pruning. Across various sequence benchmarks, LAST optimizes previous SSMs, revealing the redundancy and compressibility of their state spaces. Notably, we demonstrate that, on average, pruning 33\% of states still maintains performance with 0.52\% accuracy loss in multi-input multi-output SSMs without retraining. Code is available at https://github.com/msgwak/LAST."
Poster,LCGen: Mining in Low-Certainty Generation for View-consistent Text-to-3D,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96624,"Zeng Tao, Tong Yang, Junxiong Lin, Xinji Mai, Haoran Wang, Beining Wang, Enyu Zhou, Yan Wang, Wenqiang Zhang","The Janus Problem is a common issue in SDS-based text-to-3D methods. Due to view encoding approach and 2D diffusion prior guidance, the 3D representation model tends to learn content with higher certainty from each perspective, leading to view inconsistency. In this work, we first model and analyze the problem, visualizing the specific causes of the Janus Problem, which are associated with discrete view encoding and shared priors in 2D lifting. Based on this, we further propose the LCGen method, which guides text-to-3D to obtain different priors with different certainty from various viewpoints, aiding in view-consistent generation. Experiments have proven that our LCGen method can be directly applied to different SDS-based text-to-3D methods, alleviating the Janus Problem without introducing additional information, increasing excessive training burden, or compromising the generation effect."
