Poster,Symmetric Linear Bandits with Hidden Symmetry,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94561,"Phuong Nam Tran, The Anh Ta, Debmalya Mandal, Long Tran-Thanh","High-dimensional linear bandits with low-dimensional structure have received considerable attention in recent studies due to their practical significance. The most common structure in the literature is sparsity. However, it may not be available in practice. Symmetry, where the reward is invariant under certain groups of transformations on the set of arms, is another important inductive bias in the high-dimensional case that covers many standard structures, including sparsity. In this work, we study high-dimensional symmetric linear bandits where the symmetry is hidden from the learner, and the correct symmetry needs to be learned in an online setting. We examine the structure of a collection of hidden symmetry and provide a method based on model selection within the collection of low-dimensional subspaces. Our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $ O(d_0^{2/3} T^{2/3} \log(d))$, where $d$ is the ambient dimension which is potentially very large, and $d_0$ is the dimension of the true low-dimensional subspace such that $d_0 \ll d$. With an extra assumption on well-separated models, we can further improve the regret to $ O(d_0 \sqrt{T\log(d)} )$."
Poster,Symmetries in Overparametrized Neural Networks: A Mean Field View,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95619,"Javier Maass, Joaquin Fontbona","We develop a Mean-Field (MF) view of the learning dynamics of overparametrized Artificial Neural Networks (NN) under distributional symmetries of the data w.r.t. the action of a general compact group $G$. We consider for this a class of  generalized shallow NNs given by an ensemble of  $N$ multi-layer units, jointly trained  using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and possibly symmetry-leveraging (SL) techniques, such as Data Augmentation (DA), Feature Averaging  (FA) or Equivariant Architectures (EA).  We introduce the notions of weakly and strongly invariant  laws (WI and SI) on the parameter space of each single unit, corresponding, respectively, to $G$-invariant distributions, and to distributions supported on parameters fixed by the group action (which encode EA). This allows us to define symmetric models compatible with taking $N\to\infty$ and  give an interpretation of the asymptotic dynamics of DA, FA and EA in terms of Wasserstein Gradient Flows describing their MF limits. When activations respect the group action, we show that, for  symmetric data, DA, FA and freely-trained models obey the exact same MF  dynamic, which stays in the space of WI parameter laws and attains therein the population risk's minimizer. We also provide a counterexample to the general attainability of such an optimum over SI laws.Despite this,  and quite remarkably, we show that the space of SI laws  is also preserved by these MF distributional dynamics even when freely trained. This sharply contrasts the finite-$N$ setting, in which EAs are generally not preserved by unconstrained SGD. We illustrate the validity of our findings as $N$ gets larger,  in a teacher-student experimental setting, training a student NN to learn from a WI, SI  or arbitrary teacher model through various SL schemes. We lastly deduce a data-driven heuristic to discover the largest subspace of parameters supporting SI distributions for a problem, that could be used for designing EA with minimal generalization error."
Poster,Symmetry Discovery Beyond Affine Transformations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93474,"Ben Shaw, Abram Magner, Kevin Moon","Symmetry detection has been shown to improve various machine learning tasks. In the context of continuous symmetry detection, current state of the art experiments are limited to the detection of affine transformations. Under the manifold assumption, we outline a framework for discovering continuous symmetry in data beyond the affine transformation group. We also provide a similar framework for discovering discrete symmetry. We experimentally compare our method to an existing method known as LieGAN and show that our method is competitive at detecting affine symmetries for large sample sizes and superior than LieGAN for small sample sizes. We also show our method is able to detect continuous symmetries beyond the affine group and is  generally more computationally efficient than LieGAN."
Poster,Symmetry-Informed Governing Equation Discovery,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94538,"Jianke Yang, Wang Rao, Nima Dehmamy, Robin Walters, Rose Yu","Despite the advancements in learning governing differential equations from observations of dynamical systems, data-driven methods are often unaware of fundamental physical laws, such as frame invariance. As a result, these algorithms may search an unnecessarily large space and discover less accurate or overly complex equations. In this paper, we propose to leverage symmetry in automated equation discovery to compress the equation search space and improve the accuracy and simplicity of the learned equations. Specifically, we derive equivariance constraints from the time-independent symmetries of ODEs. Depending on the types of symmetries, we develop a pipeline for incorporating symmetry constraints into various equation discovery algorithms, including sparse regression and genetic programming. In experiments across diverse dynamical systems, our approach demonstrates better robustness against noise and recovers governing equations with significantly higher probability than baselines without symmetry."
Poster,Synatra: Turning Indirect Knowledge into Direct Demonstrations for Digital Agents at Scale,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95647,"Tianyue Ou, Frank F. Xu, Aman Madaan, Jiarui Liu, Robert Lo, Abishek Sridhar, Sudipta Sengupta, Dan Roth, Graham Neubig, Shuyan Zhou","LLMs can now act as autonomous agents that interact with digital environments and complete specific objectives (e.g., arranging an online meeting). However, accuracy is still far from satisfactory, partly due to a lack of large-scale, direct demonstrations for digital tasks. Obtaining supervised data from humans is costly, and automatic data collection through exploration or reinforcement learning relies on complex environmental and content setup, resulting in datasets that lack comprehensive coverage of various scenarios. On the other hand, there is abundant knowledge that may indirectly assist task completion, such as online tutorials that were created for human consumption. In this work, we present Synatra, an approach that effectively transforms this indirect knowledge into direct supervision at scale. We define different types of indirect knowledge, and carefully study the available sources to obtain it, methods to encode the structure of direct demonstrations, and finally methods to transform indirect knowledge into direct demonstrations. We use 100k such synthetically-created demonstrations to finetune a 7B CodeLlama, and demonstrate that the resulting agent surpasses all comparably sized models on three web-based task benchmarks Mind2Web, MiniWoB++ and WebArena, as well as surpassing GPT-3.5 on WebArena and Mind2Web. In addition, while synthetic demonstrations prove to be only 3% the cost of human demonstrations (at $0.031 each), we show that the synthetic demonstrations can be more effective than an identical number of human demonstrations collected from limited domains."
Poster,SyncTweedies: A General Generative Framework Based on Synchronized Diffusions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96953,"Jaihoon Kim, Juil Koo, Kyeongmin Yeo, Minhyuk Sung","We introduce a general diffusion synchronization framework for generating diverse visual content, including ambiguous images, panorama images, 3D mesh textures, and 3D Gaussian splats textures, using a pretrained image diffusion model. We first present an analysis of various scenarios for synchronizing multiple diffusion processes through a canonical space. Based on the analysis, we introduce a synchronized diffusion method, SyncTweedies, which averages the outputs of Tweedie’s formula while conducting denoising in multiple instance spaces. Compared to previous work that achieves synchronization through finetuning, SyncTweedies is a zero-shot method that does not require any finetuning, preserving the rich prior of diffusion models trained on Internet-scale image datasets without overfitting to specific domains. We verify that SyncTweedies offers the broadest applicability to diverse applications and superior performance compared to the previous state-of-the-art for each application.

Poster,SyncVIS: Synchronized Video Instance Segmentation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93331,"Rongkun Zheng, Lu Qi, Xi Chen, Yi Wang, Kun Wang, Yu Qiao, Hengshuang Zhao","Recent DETR-based methods have advanced the development of Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) through transformers' efficiency and capability in modeling spatial and temporal information. Despite harvesting remarkable progress, existing works follow asynchronous designs, which model video sequences via either video-level queries only or adopting query-sensitive cascade structures, resulting in difficulties when handling complex and challenging video scenarios. In this work, we analyze the cause of this phenomenon and the limitations of the current solutions, and propose to conduct synchronized modeling via a new framework named SyncVIS. Specifically, SyncVIS explicitly introduces video-level query embeddings and designs two key modules to synchronize video-level query with frame-level query embeddings: a synchronized video-frame modeling paradigm and a synchronized embedding optimization strategy. The former attempts to promote the mutual learning of frame- and video-level embeddings with each other and the latter divides large video sequences into small clips for easier optimization. Extensive experimental evaluations are conducted on the challenging YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021 & 2022, and OVIS benchmarks, and SyncVIS achieves state-of-the-art results, which demonstrates the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach.

Poster,Synergistic Dual Spatial-aware Generation of Image-to-text and Text-to-image,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94701,"Yu Zhao, Hao Fei, Xiangtai Li, Libo Qin, Jiayi Ji, Hongyuan Zhu, Meishan Zhang, Min Zhang, Jianguo Wei","In the visual spatial understanding (VSU) field, spatial image-to-text (SI2T) and spatial text-to-image (ST2I) are two fundamental tasks that appear in dual form. Existing methods for standalone SI2T or ST2I perform imperfectly in spatial understanding, due to the difficulty of 3D-wise spatial feature modeling. In this work, we consider modeling the SI2T and ST2I together under a dual learning framework. During the dual framework, we then propose to represent the 3D spatial scene features with a novel 3D scene graph (3DSG) representation that can be shared and beneficial to both tasks. Further, inspired by the intuition that the easier 3D$\to$image and 3D$\to$text processes also exist symmetrically in the ST2I and SI2T, respectively, we propose the Spatial Dual Discrete Diffusion (SD$^3$) framework, which utilizes the intermediate features of the 3D$\to$X processes to guide the hard X$\to$3D processes, such that the overall ST2I and SI2T will benefit each other. On the visual spatial understanding dataset VSD, our system outperforms the mainstream T2I and I2T methods significantly.Further in-depth analysis reveals how our dual learning strategy advances."
Poster,SynRS3D: A Synthetic Dataset for Global 3D Semantic Understanding from Monocular Remote Sensing Imagery,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97574,"Jian Song, Hongruixuan Chen, Weihao Xuan, Junshi Xia, Naoto YOKOYA","Global semantic 3D understanding from single-view high-resolution remote sensing (RS) imagery is crucial for Earth observation (EO). However, this task faces significant challenges due to the high costs of annotations and data collection, as well as geographically restricted data availability. To address these challenges, synthetic data offer a promising solution by being unrestricted and automatically annotatable, thus enabling the provision of large and diverse datasets. We develop a specialized synthetic data generation pipeline for EO and introduce SynRS3D, the largest synthetic RS dataset. SynRS3D comprises 69,667 high-resolution optical images that cover six different city styles worldwide and feature eight land cover types, precise height information, and building change masks. To further enhance its utility, we develop a novel multi-task unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method, RS3DAda, coupled with our synthetic dataset, which facilitates the RS-specific transition from synthetic to real scenarios for land cover mapping and height estimation tasks, ultimately enabling global monocular 3D semantic understanding based on synthetic data. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the adaptability and effectiveness of our synthetic dataset and the proposed RS3DAda method. SynRS3D and related codes are available at https://github.com/JTRNEO/SynRS3D."
Poster,"Synthesize, Partition, then Adapt: Eliciting Diverse Samples from Foundation Models",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93371,"Yeming Wen, Swarat Chaudhuri","Presenting users with diverse responses from foundation models is crucial for enhancing user experience and accommodating varying preferences. However, generating multiple high-quality and diverse responses without sacrificing accuracy remains a challenge, especially when using greedy sampling. In this work, we propose a novel framework, Synthesize-Partition-Adapt (SPA), that leverages the abundant synthetic data available in many domains to elicit diverse responses from foundation models.By leveraging signal provided by data attribution methods such as influence functions, SPA partitions data into subsets, each targeting unique aspects of the data, and trains multiple model adaptations optimized for these subsets.Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in diversifying foundation model responses while maintaining high quality, showcased through the HumanEval and MBPP tasks in the code generation domain and several tasks in the natural language understanding domain, highlighting its potential to enrich user experience across various applications."
