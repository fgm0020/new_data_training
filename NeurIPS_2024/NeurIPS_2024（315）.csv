Poster,Pre-Trained Multi-Goal Transformers with Prompt Optimization for Efficient Online Adaptation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96096,"Haoqi Yuan, Yuhui Fu, Feiyang Xie, Zongqing Lu","Efficiently solving unseen tasks remains a challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), especially for long-horizon tasks composed of multiple subtasks. Pre-training policies from task-agnostic datasets has emerged as a promising approach, yet existing methods still necessitate substantial interactions via RL to learn new tasks.We introduce MGPO, a method that leverages the power of Transformer-based policies to model sequences of goals, enabling efficient online adaptation through prompt optimization.In its pre-training phase, MGPO utilizes hindsight multi-goal relabeling and behavior cloning. This combination equips the policy to model diverse long-horizon behaviors that align with varying goal sequences.During online adaptation, the goal sequence, conceptualized as a prompt, is optimized to improve task performance. We adopt a multi-armed bandit framework for this process, enhancing prompt selection based on the returns from online trajectories.Our experiments across various environments demonstrate that MGPO holds substantial advantages in sample efficiency, online adaptation performance, robustness, and interpretability compared with existing methods."
Poster,Pretrained Optimization Model for Zero-Shot Black Box Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94202,"Xiaobin Li, Kai Wu, yujian li, Xiaoyu Zhang, Handing Wang, Jing Liu","Zero-shot optimization involves optimizing a target task that was not seen during training, aiming to provide the optimal solution without or with minimal adjustments to the optimizer. It is crucial to ensure reliable and robust performance in various applications. Current optimizers often struggle with zero-shot optimization and require intricate hyperparameter tuning to adapt to new tasks. To address this, we propose a Pretrained Optimization Model (POM) that leverages knowledge gained from optimizing diverse tasks, offering efficient solutions to zero-shot optimization through direct application or fine-tuning with few-shot samples. Evaluation on the BBOB benchmark and two robot control tasks demonstrates that POM outperforms state-of-the-art black-box optimization methods, especially for high-dimensional tasks. Fine-tuning POM with a small number of samples and budget yields significant performance improvements. Moreover, POM demonstrates robust generalization across diverse task distributions, dimensions, population sizes, and optimization horizons.

Poster,Pre-trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Are Versatile Representation Learners for Control,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95658,"Gunshi Gupta, Karmesh Yadav, Yarin Gal, Dhruv Batra, Zsolt Kira, Cong Lu, Tim G. J. Rudner","Embodied AI agents require a fine-grained understanding of the physical world mediated through visual and language inputs. Such capabilities are difficult to learn solely from task-specific data. This has led to the emergence of pre-trained vision-language models as a tool for transferring representations learned from internet-scale data to downstream tasks and new domains. However, commonly used contrastively trained representations such as in CLIP have been shown to fail at enabling embodied agents to gain a sufficiently fine-grained scene understanding—a capability vital for control. To address this shortcoming, we consider representations from pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, which are explicitly optimized to generate images from text prompts and as such, contain text-conditioned representations that reflect highly fine-grained visuo-spatial information. Using pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, we construct Stable Control Representations which allow learning downstream control policies that generalize to complex, open-ended environments. We show that policies learned using Stable Control Representations are competitive with state-of-the-art representation learning approaches across a broad range of simulated control settings, encompassing challenging manipulation and navigation tasks. Most notably, we show that Stable Control Representations enable learning policies that exhibit state-of-the-art performance on OVMM, a difficult open-vocabulary navigation benchmark."
Poster,Pretrained Transformer Efficiently Learns Low-Dimensional Target Functions In-Context,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93281,"Kazusato Oko, Yujin Song, Taiji Suzuki, Denny Wu","Transformers can efficiently learn in-context from example demonstrations. Most existing theoretical analyses studied the in-context learning (ICL) ability of transformers for linear function classes, where it is typically shown that the minimizer of the pretraining loss implements one gradient descent step on the least squares objective. However, this simplified linear setting arguably does not demonstrate the statistical efficiency of ICL, since the pretrained transformer does not outperform directly solving linear regression on the test prompt. In this paper, we study ICL of a nonlinear function class via transformer with nonlinear MLP layer: given a class of \textit{single-index} target functions $f_*(\boldsymbol{x}) = \sigma_*(\langle\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{\beta}\rangle)$, where the index features $\boldsymbol{\beta}\in\mathbb{R}^d$ are drawn from a $r$-dimensional subspace, we show that a nonlinear transformer optimized by gradient descent (with a pretraining sample complexity that depends on the \textit{information exponent} of the link functions $\sigma_*$) learns $f_*$ in-context with a prompt length that only depends on the dimension of the distribution of target functions $r$; in contrast, any algorithm that directly learns $f_*$ on test prompt yields a statistical complexity that scales with the ambient dimension $d$.  Our result highlights the adaptivity of the pretrained transformer to low-dimensional structures of the function class, which enables sample-efficient ICL that outperforms estimators that only have access to the in-context data."
Poster,Pretraining Codomain Attention Neural Operators for Solving Multiphysics PDEs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93155,"Md Ashiqur Rahman, Robert Joseph George, Mogab Elleithy, Daniel Leibovici, Zongyi Li, Boris Bonev, Colin White, Julius Berner, Raymond A. Yeh, Jean Kossaifi, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, Animashree Anandkumar","Existing neural operator architectures face challenges when solving multiphysics problems with coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) due to complex geometries, interactions between physical variables, and the limited amounts of high-resolution training data. To address these issues, we propose *Codomain Attention Neural Operator* (CoDA-NO), which tokenizes functions along the codomain or channel space, enabling self-supervised learning or pretraining of multiple PDE systems. Specifically, we extend positional encoding, self-attention, and normalization layers to function spaces. CoDA-NO can learn representations of different PDE systems with a single model. We evaluate CoDA-NO's potential as a backbone for learning multiphysics PDEs over multiple systems by considering few-shot learning settings. On complex downstream tasks with limited data, such as fluid flow simulations, fluid-structure interactions, and Rayleigh-Bénard convection, we found CoDA-NO to outperform existing methods by over 36%."
Poster,Pre-training Differentially Private Models with Limited Public Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95904,"Zhiqi Bu, Xinwei Zhang, Sheng Zha, Mingyi Hong, George Karypis","The superior performance of large foundation models can be attributed to the use of massive amounts of high-quality data. However, such datasets often contain sensitive, private and copyrighted material that requires formal protection. While differential privacy (DP) is a prominent method used to gauge the degree of security provided to large foundation models, its application in large foundation models has been met with limited success because there are often significant performance compromises when applying DP during the pre-training phase. Consequently, DP is more commonly implemented during the model fine-tuning stage, hence not capable of protecting a substantial portion of the data used during the initial pre-training process. In this work, we first provide a theoretical understanding of the efficacy of DP training by analyzing the per-iteration improvement of loss through the lens of the Hessian. We observe that DP optimizers' deceleration can be significantly mitigated by the use of limited public data, and thus propose the DP continual pre-training strategy. Our DP continual pre-training on vision models, using only 10% of public data, have achieved DP accuracy of 41.5% on ImageNet-21k (with epsilon=8) and non-DP accuracy of 55.7% on Places365 and 60.0% on iNaturalist-2021, which are on par with state-of-the-art standard pre-training and outperform existing DP pertained models. Our DP pre-trained models are released in *fastDP* library (https://github.com/awslabs/fast-differential-privacy/releases/tag/v2.1)"
Poster,Pretraining with Random Noise for Fast and Robust Learning without Weight Transport,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96093,"Jeonghwan Cheon, Sang Wan Lee, Se-Bum Paik","The brain prepares for learning even before interacting with the environment, by refining and optimizing its structures through spontaneous neural activity that resembles random noise. However, the mechanism of such a process has yet to be understood, and it is unclear whether this process can benefit the algorithm of machine learning. Here, we study this issue using a neural network with a feedback alignment algorithm, demonstrating that pretraining neural networks with random noise increases the learning efficiency as well as generalization abilities without weight transport. First, we found that random noise training modifies forward weights to match backward synaptic feedback, which is necessary for teaching errors by feedback alignment. As a result, a network with pre-aligned weights learns notably faster and reaches higher accuracy than a network without random noise training, even comparable to the backpropagation algorithm. We also found that the effective dimensionality of weights decreases in a network pretrained with random noise. This pre-regularization allows the network to learn simple solutions of a low rank, reducing the generalization error during subsequent training. This also enables the network to robustly generalize a novel, out-of-distribution dataset. Lastly, we confirmed that random noise pretraining reduces the amount of meta-loss, enhancing the network ability to adapt to various tasks. Overall, our results suggest that random noise training with feedback alignment offers a straightforward yet effective method of pretraining that facilitates quick and reliable learning without weight transport."
Poster,Preventing Dimensional Collapse in Self-Supervised Learning via Orthogonality Regularization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94724,"Junlin He, Jinxiao Du, Wei Ma","Self-supervised learning (SSL) has rapidly advanced in recent years, approaching the performance of its supervised counterparts through the extraction of representations from unlabeled data. However, dimensional collapse, where a few large eigenvalues dominate the eigenspace, poses a significant obstacle for SSL. When dimensional collapse occurs on features (e.g. hidden features and representations), it prevents features from representing the full information of the data; when dimensional collapse occurs on weight matrices, their filters are self-related and redundant, limiting their expressive power.Existing studies have predominantly concentrated on the dimensional collapse of representations, neglecting whether this can sufficiently prevent the dimensional collapse of the weight matrices and hidden features. To this end, we first time propose a mitigation approach employing orthogonal regularization (OR) across the encoder, targeting both convolutional and linear layers during pretraining. OR promotes orthogonality within weight matrices, thus safeguarding against the dimensional collapse of weight matrices, hidden features, and representations. Our empirical investigations demonstrate that OR significantly enhances the performance of SSL methods across diverse benchmarks, yielding consistent gains with both CNNs and Transformer-based architectures."
Poster,Preventing Model Collapse in Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis by Noise Regularization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95833,"Junlin He, Jinxiao Du, Susu Xu, Wei Ma","Multi-View Representation Learning (MVRL) aims to learn a unified representation of an object from multi-view data.Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA) and its variants share simple formulations and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. However, with extensive experiments, we observe the issue of model collapse, i.e., the performance of DCCA-based methods will drop drastically when training proceeds. The model collapse issue could significantly hinder the wide adoption of DCCA-based methods because it is challenging to decide when to early stop. To this end, we develop NR-DCCA, which is equipped with a novel noise regularization approach to prevent model collapse. Theoretical analysis shows that the Correlation Invariant Property is the key to preventing model collapse, and our noise regularization forces the neural network to possess such a property. A framework to construct synthetic data with different common and complementary information is also developed to compare MVRL methods comprehensively. The developed NR-DCCA outperforms baselines stably and consistently in both synthetic and real-world datasets, and the proposed noise regularization approach can also be generalized to other DCCA-based methods such as DGCCA."
Poster,Pricing and Competition for Generative AI,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96374,Rafid Mahmood,"Compared to classical machine learning (ML) models, generative models offer a new usage paradigm where (i) a single model can be used for many different tasks out-of-the-box; (ii) users interact with this model over a series of natural language prompts; and (iii) the model is ideally evaluated on binary user satisfaction with respect to model outputs. Given these characteristics, we explore the problem of how developers of new generative AI software can release and price their technology. We first develop a comparison of two different models for a specific task with respect to user cost-effectiveness. We then model the pricing problem of generative AI software as a game between two different companies who sequentially release their models before users choose their preferred model for each task. Here, the price optimization problem becomes piecewise continuous where the companies must choose a subset of the tasks on which to be cost-effective and forgo revenue for the remaining tasks. In particular, we reveal the value of market information by showing that a company who deploys later after knowing their competitor’s price can always secure cost-effectiveness on at least one task, whereas the company who is the first-to-market must price their model in a way that incentivizes higher prices from the latecomer in order to gain revenue. Most importantly, we find that if the different tasks are sufficiently similar, the first-to-market model may become cost-ineffective on all tasks regardless of how this technology is priced."
