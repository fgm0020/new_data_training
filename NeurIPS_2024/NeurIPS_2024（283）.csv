Poster,OccFusion: Rendering Occluded Humans with Generative Diffusion Priors,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96139,"Adam Sun, Tiange Xiang, Scott Delp, Fei-Fei Li, Ehsan Adeli","Existing human rendering methods require every part of the human to be fully visible throughout the input video. However, this assumption does not hold in real-life settings where obstructions are common, resulting in only partial visibility of the human. Considering this, we present OccFusion, an approach that utilizes efficient 3D Gaussian splatting supervised by pretrained 2D diffusion models for efficient and high-fidelity human rendering. We propose a pipeline consisting of three stages. In the Initialization stage, complete human masks are generated from partial visibility masks. In the Optimization stage, 3D human Gaussians are optimized with additional supervisions by Score-Distillation Sampling (SDS) to create a complete geometry of the human. Finally, in the Refinement stage, in-context inpainting is designed to further improve rendering quality on the less observed human body parts. We evaluate OccFusion on ZJU-MoCap and challenging OcMotion sequences and found that it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the rendering of occluded humans."
Poster,"Occupancy-based Policy Gradient: Estimation, Convergence, and Optimality",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95408,"Audrey Huang, Nan Jiang","Occupancy functions play an instrumental role in reinforcement learning (RL) for guiding exploration, handling distribution shift, and optimizing general objectives beyond the expected return. Yet, computationally efficient policy optimization methods that use (only) occupancy functions are virtually non-existent. In this paper, we establish the theoretical foundations of model-free policy gradient (PG) methods that compute the gradient through the occupancy for both online and offline RL, without modeling value functions. Our algorithms reduce gradient estimation to squared-loss regression and are computationally oracle-efficient. We characterize the sample complexities of both local and global convergence, accounting for both finite-sample estimation error and the roles of exploration (online) and data coverage (offline). Occupancy-based PG naturally handles arbitrary offline data distributions, and, with one-line algorithmic changes, can be adapted to optimize any differentiable objective functional."
Poster,Octopus: A Multi-modal LLM with Parallel Recognition and Sequential Understanding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93251,"Chuyang Zhao, YuXin Song, Junru Chen, KANG RONG, Haocheng Feng, Gang Zhang, Shufan Ji, Jingdong Wang, Errui Ding, Yifan Sun","A mainstream of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have two essential functions, i.e., visual recognition (e.g., grounding) and understanding (e.g., visual question answering). Presently, all these MLLMs integrate visual recognition and understanding in a same sequential manner in the LLM head, i.e., generating the response token-by-token for both recognition and understanding. We think unifying them in the same sequential manner is not optimal for two reasons: 1) parallel recognition is more efficient than sequential recognition and is actually prevailing in deep visual recognition, and 2) the recognition results can be integrated to help high-level cognition (while the current manner does not). Such motivated, this paper proposes a novel “parallel recognition → sequential understanding” framework for MLLMs. The bottom LLM layers are utilized for parallel recognition and the recognition results are relayed into the top LLM layers for sequential understanding. Specifically, parallel recognition in the bottom LLM layers is implemented via object queries, a popular mechanism in DEtection TRansformer, which we find to harmonize well with the LLM layers. Empirical studies show our MLLM named Octopus improves accuracy on popular MLLM tasks and is up to 5× faster on visual grounding tasks."
Poster,OctreeOcc: Efficient and Multi-Granularity Occupancy Prediction Using Octree Queries,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93597,"Yuhang Lu, Xinge ZHU, Tai WANG, Yuexin Ma","Occupancy prediction has increasingly garnered attention in recent years for its fine-grained understanding of 3D scenes. Traditional approaches typically rely on dense, regular grid representations, which often leads to excessive computational demands and a loss of spatial details for small objects. This paper introduces OctreeOcc, an innovative 3D occupancy prediction framework that leverages the octree representation to adaptively capture valuable information in 3D, offering variable granularity to accommodate object shapes and semantic regions of varying sizes and complexities. In particular, we incorporate image semantic information to improve the accuracy of initial octree structures and design an effective rectification mechanism to refine the octree structure iteratively. Our extensive evaluations show that OctreeOcc not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods in occupancy prediction, but also achieves a 15%-24% reduction in computational overhead compared to dense-grid-based methods."
Poster,ODGEN: Domain-specific Object Detection Data Generation with Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93889,"Jingyuan Zhu, Shiyu Li, Yuxuan Liu, Jian Yuan, Ping Huang, Jiulong Shan, Huimin Ma","Modern diffusion-based image generative models have made significant progress and become promising to enrich training data for the object detection task. However, the generation quality and the controllability for complex scenes containing multi-class objects and dense objects with occlusions remain limited. This paper presents ODGEN, a novel method to generate high-quality images conditioned on bounding boxes, thereby facilitating data synthesis for object detection. Given a domain-specific object detection dataset, we first fine-tune a pre-trained diffusion model on both cropped foreground objects and entire images to fit target distributions. Then we propose to control the diffusion model using synthesized visual prompts with spatial constraints and object-wise textual descriptions. ODGEN exhibits robustness in handling complex scenes and specific domains. Further, we design a dataset synthesis pipeline to evaluate ODGEN on 7 domain-specific benchmarks to demonstrate its effectiveness. Adding training data generated by ODGEN improves up to 25.3% mAP@.50:.95 with object detectors like YOLOv5 and YOLOv7, outperforming prior controllable generative methods. In addition, we design an evaluation protocol based on COCO-2014 to validate ODGEN in general domains and observe an advantage up to 5.6% in mAP@.50:.95 against existing methods."
Poster,ODGS: 3D Scene Reconstruction from Omnidirectional Images with 3D Gaussian Splattings,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96122,"Suyoung Lee, Jaeyoung Chung, Jaeyoo Huh, Kyoung Mu Lee","Omnidirectional (or 360-degree) images are increasingly being used for 3D applications since they allow the rendering of an entire scene with a single image. Existing works based on neural radiance fields demonstrate successful 3D reconstruction quality on egocentric videos, yet they suffer from long training and rendering times. Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting has gained attention for its fast optimization and real-time rendering. However, directly using a perspective rasterizer to omnidirectional images results in severe distortion due to the different optical properties between the two image domains. In this work, we present ODGS, a novel rasterization pipeline for omnidirectional images with geometric interpretation. For each Gaussian, we define a tangent plane that touches the unit sphere and is perpendicular to the ray headed toward the Gaussian center. We then leverage a perspective camera rasterizer to project the Gaussian onto the corresponding tangent plane. The projected Gaussians are transformed and combined into the omnidirectional image, finalizing the omnidirectional rasterization process. This interpretation reveals the implicit assumptions within the proposed pipeline, which we verify through mathematical proofs. The entire rasterization process is parallelized using CUDA, achieving optimization and rendering speeds 100 times faster than NeRF-based methods. Our comprehensive experiments highlight the superiority of ODGS by delivering the best reconstruction and perceptual quality across various datasets. Additionally, results on roaming datasets demonstrate that ODGS effectively restores fine details, even when reconstructing large 3D scenes. The source code is available on our project page (https://github.com/esw0116/ODGS)."
Poster,ODRL: A Benchmark for Off-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97619,"Jiafei Lyu, Kang Xu, Jiacheng Xu, yan, Jing-Wen Yang, Zongzhang Zhang, Chenjia Bai, Zongqing Lu, Xiu Li","We consider off-dynamics reinforcement learning (RL) where one needs to transfer policies across different domains with dynamics mismatch. Despite the focus on developing dynamics-aware algorithms, this field is hindered due to the lack of a standard benchmark. To bridge this gap, we introduce ODRL, the first benchmark tailored for evaluating off-dynamics RL methods. ODRL contains four experimental settings where the source and target domains can be either online or offline, and provides diverse tasks and a broad spectrum of dynamics shifts, making it a reliable platform to comprehensively evaluate the agent's adaptation ability to the target domain. Furthermore, ODRL includes recent off-dynamics RL algorithms in a unified framework and introduces some extra baselines for different settings, all implemented in a single-file manner. To unpack the true adaptation capability of existing methods, we conduct extensive benchmarking experiments, which show that no method has universal advantages across varied dynamics shifts. We hope this benchmark can serve as a cornerstone for future research endeavors. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/OffDynamicsRL/off-dynamics-rl."
Poster,Off-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning via Domain Adaptation and Reward Augmented Imitation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93921,"Yihong Guo, Yixuan Wang, Yuanyuan Shi, Pan Xu, Anqi Liu","Training a policy in a source domain for deployment in the target domain under a dynamics shift can be challenging, often resulting in performance degradation. Previous work tackles this challenge by training on the source domain with modified rewards derived by matching distributions between the source and the target optimal trajectories. However, pure modified rewards only ensure the behavior of the learned policy in the source domain resembles trajectories produced by the target optimal policies, which does not guarantee optimal performance when the learned policy is actually deployed to the target domain. In this work, we propose to utilize imitation learning to transfer the policy learned from the reward modification to the target domain so that the new policy can generate the same trajectories in the target domain. Our approach, Domain Adaptation and Reward Augmented Imitation Learning (DARAIL), utilizes the reward modification for domain adaptation and follows the general framework of generative adversarial imitation learning from observation (GAIfO) by applying a reward augmented estimator for the policy optimization step. Theoretically, we present an error bound for our method under a mild assumption regarding the dynamics shift to justify the motivation of our method. Empirically, our method outperforms the pure modified reward method without imitation learning and also outperforms other baselines in benchmark off-dynamics environments."
Poster,Offline Behavior Distillation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96389,"Shiye Lei, Sen Zhang, Dacheng Tao","Massive reinforcement learning (RL) data are typically collected to train policies offline without the need for interactions, but the large data volume can cause training inefficiencies. To tackle this issue, we formulate offline behavior distillation (OBD), which synthesizes limited expert behavioral data from sub-optimal RL data, enabling rapid policy learning. We propose two naive OBD objectives, DBC and PBC, which measure distillation performance via the decision difference between policies trained on distilled data and either offline data or a near-expert policy. Due to intractable bi-level optimization, the OBD objective is difficult to minimize to small values, which deteriorates PBC by its distillation performance guarantee with quadratic discount complexity $\mathcal{O}(1/(1-\gamma)^2)$. We theoretically establish the equivalence between the policy performance and action-value weighted decision difference, and introduce action-value weighted PBC (Av-PBC) as a more effective OBD objective. By optimizing the weighted decision difference, Av-PBC achieves a superior distillation guarantee with linear discount complexity $\mathcal{O}(1/(1-\gamma))$. Extensive experiments on multiple D4RL datasets reveal that Av-PBC offers significant improvements in OBD performance, fast distillation convergence speed, and robust cross-architecture/optimizer generalization."
Poster,Offline Multitask Representation Learning for Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96488,"Haque Ishfaq, Thanh Nguyen-Tang, Songtao Feng, Raman Arora, Mengdi Wang, Ming Yin, Doina Precup","We study offline multitask representation learning in reinforcement learning (RL), where a learner is provided with an offline dataset from different tasks that share a common representation and is asked to learn the shared representation. We theoretically investigate offline multitask low-rank RL, and propose a new algorithm called MORL for offline multitask representation learning. Furthermore, we examine downstream RL in reward-free, offline and online scenarios, where a new task is introduced to the agent that shares the same representation as the upstream offline tasks. Our theoretical results demonstrate the benefits of using the learned representation from the upstream offline task instead of directly learning the representation of the low-rank model."
