Poster,You Only Look Around: Learning Illumination-Invariant Feature for Low-light Object Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95490,"Mingbo Hong, Shen Cheng, Haibin Huang, Haoqiang Fan, Shuaicheng Liu","In this paper, we introduce YOLA, a novel framework for object detection in low-light scenarios. Unlike previous works, we propose to tackle this challenging problem from the perspective of feature learning. Specifically, we propose to learn illumination-invariant features through the Lambertian image formation model. We observe that, under the Lambertian assumption, it is feasible to approximate illumination-invariant feature maps by exploiting the interrelationships between neighboring color channels and spatially adjacent pixels. By incorporating additional constraints, these relationships can be characterized in the form of convolutional kernels, which can be trained in a detection-driven manner within a network. Towards this end, we introduce a novel module dedicated to the extraction of illumination-invariant features from low-light images, which can be easily integrated into existing object detection frameworks. Our empirical findings reveal significant improvements in low-light object detection tasks, as well as promising results in both well-lit and over-lit scenarios."
Poster,Your contrastive learning problem is secretly a distribution alignment problem,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94010,"Zihao Chen, Chi-Heng Lin, Ran Liu, Jingyun Xiao, Eva Dyer","Despite the success of contrastive learning (CL) in vision and language, its theoretical foundations and mechanisms for building representations remain poorly understood. In this work, we build connections between noise contrastive estimation losses widely used in CL and distribution alignment with entropic optimal transport (OT). This connection allows us to develop a family of different losses and multistep iterative variants for existing CL methods. Intuitively, by using more information from the distribution of latents, our approach allows a more distribution-aware  manipulation of the relationships within augmented sample sets.We provide theoretical insights and experimental evidence demonstrating the benefits of our approach for generalized contrastive alignment. Through this framework, it is possible to leverage tools in OT to build unbalanced losses to handle noisy views and customize the representation space by changing the constraints on alignment.By reframing contrastive learning as an alignment problem and leveraging existing optimization tools for OT, our work provides new insights and connections between different self-supervised learning models in addition to new tools that can be more easily adapted to incorporate domain knowledge into learning."
Poster,Your Diffusion Model is Secretly a Noise Classifier and Benefits from Contrastive Training,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95188,"Yunshu Wu, Yingtao Luo, Xianghao Kong, Vagelis Papalexakis, Greg Ver Steeg","Diffusion models learn to denoise data and the trained denoiser is then used to generate new samples from the data distribution. In this paper, we revisit the diffusion sampling process and identify a fundamental cause of sample quality degradation: the denoiser is poorly estimated in regions that are far Outside Of the training Distribution (OOD), and the sampling process inevitably evaluates in these OOD regions.This can become problematic for all sampling methods, especially when we move to parallel sampling which requires us to initialize and update the entire sample trajectory of dynamics in parallel, leading to many OOD evaluations. To address this problem, we introduce a new self-supervised training objective that differentiates the levels of noise added to a sample, leading to improved OOD denoising performance. The approach is based on our observation that diffusion models implicitly define a log-likelihood ratio that distinguishes distributions with different amounts of noise, and this expression depends on denoiser performance outside the standard training distribution.We show by diverse experiments that the proposed contrastive diffusion training is effective for both sequential and parallel settings, and it improves the performance and speed of parallel samplers significantly.

Poster,ZeroMark: Towards Dataset Ownership Verification without Disclosing Watermark,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96006,"Junfeng Guo, Yiming Li, Ruibo Chen, Yihan Wu, chenxi liu, Heng Huang","High-quality public datasets significantly prompt the prosperity of deep neural networks (DNNs). Currently, dataset ownership verification (DOV), which consists of dataset watermarking and ownership verification, is the only feasible solution to protect their copyright by preventing unauthorized use. In this paper, we revisit existing DOV methods and find that they all mainly focused on the first stage by designing different types of dataset watermarks and directly exploiting watermarked samples as the verification samples for ownership verification. As such, their success relies on an underlying assumption that verification is a \emph{one-time} and \emph{privacy-preserving} process, which does not necessarily hold in practice. To alleviate this problem, we propose \emph{ZeroMark} to conduct ownership verification without disclosing dataset-specified watermarks. Our method is inspired by our empirical and theoretical findings of the intrinsic property of DNNs trained on the watermarked dataset. Specifically, ZeroMark first generates the closest boundary version of given benign samples and calculates their boundary gradients under the label-only black-box setting. After that, it examines whether the given suspicious method has been trained on the protected dataset by performing a hypothesis test, based on the cosine similarity measured on the boundary gradients and the watermark pattern. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our ZeroMark and its resistance to potential adaptive attacks. The codes for reproducing our main experiments are publicly available at \href{https://github.com/JunfengGo/ZeroMark.git}{GitHub}."
Poster,Zero-Shot Event-Intensity Asymmetric Stereo via Visual Prompting from Image Domain,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96057,"Hanyue Lou, Jinxiu (Sherry) Liang, Minggui Teng, Bin Fan, Yong Xu, Boxin Shi","Event-intensity asymmetric stereo systems have emerged as a promising approach for robust 3D perception in dynamic and challenging environments by integrating event cameras with frame-based sensors in different views. However, existing methods often suffer from overfitting and poor generalization due to limited dataset sizes and lack of scene diversity in the event domain. To address these issues, we propose a zero-shot framework that utilizes monocular depth estimation and stereo matching models pretrained on diverse image datasets. Our approach introduces a visual prompting technique to align the representations of frames and events, allowing the use of off-the-shelf stereo models without additional training. Furthermore, we introduce a monocular cue-guided disparity refinement module to improve robustness across static and dynamic regions by incorporating monocular depth information from foundation models. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior zero-shot evaluation performance and enhanced generalization ability of our method compared to existing approaches."
Poster,Zero-shot Generalizable Incremental Learning for Vision-Language Object Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94639,"Jieren Deng, Haojian Zhang, Kun Ding, Jianhua Hu, Xingxuan Zhang, Yunkuan Wang","This paper presents Incremental Vision-Language Object Detection (IVLOD), a novel learning task designed to incrementally adapt pre-trained Vision-Language Object Detection Models (VLODMs) to various specialized domains, while simultaneously preserving their zero-shot generalization capabilities for the generalized domain. To address this new challenge, we present the Zero-interference Reparameterizable Adaptation (ZiRa), a novel method that introduces Zero-interference Loss and reparameterization techniques to tackle IVLOD without incurring a significant increase in memory usage. Comprehensive experiments on COCO and ODinW-13 datasets demonstrate that ZiRa effectively safeguards the zero-shot generalization ability of VLODMs while continuously adapting to new tasks. Specifically, after training on ODinW-13 datasets, ZiRa exhibits superior performance compared to CL-DETR and iDETR, boosting zero-shot generalizability by substantial $\textbf{13.91}$ and $\textbf{8.74}$ AP, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/JarintotionDin/ZiRaGroundingDINO."
Poster,Zero-shot Image Editing with Reference Imitation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95583,"Xi Chen, Yutong Feng, Mengting Chen, Yiyang Wang, Shilong Zhang, Yu Liu, Yujun Shen, Hengshuang Zhao","Image editing serves as a practical yet challenging task considering the diverse demands from users, where one of the hardest parts is to precisely describe how the edited image should look like. In this work, we present a new form of editing, termed imitative editing, to help users exercise their creativity more conveniently. Concretely, to edit an image region of interest, users are free to directly draw inspiration from some in-the-wild references (e.g., some relative pictures come across online), without having to cope with the fit between the reference and the source. Such a design requires the system to automatically figure out what to expect from the reference to perform the editing. For this purpose, we propose a generative training framework, dubbed MimicBrush, which randomly selects two frames from a video clip, masks some regions of one frame, and learns to recover the masked regions using the information from the other frame. That way, our model, developed from a diffusion prior, is able to capture the semantic correspondence between separate images in a self-supervised manner. We experimentally show the effectiveness of our method under various test cases as well as its superiority over existing alternatives. We also construct a benchmark to facilitate further research."
Poster,Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning from Low Quality Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96479,"Scott Jeen, Tom Bewley, Jonathan Cullen","Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) promises to provide agents that can perform _any_ task in an environment after an offline, reward-free pre-training phase. Methods leveraging successor measures and successor features have shown strong performance in this setting, but require access to large heterogenous datasets for pre-training which cannot be expected for most real problems. Here, we explore how the performance of zero-shot RL methods degrades when trained on small homogeneous datasets, and propose fixes inspired by _conservatism_, a well-established feature of performant single-task offline RL algorithms. We evaluate our proposals across various datasets, domains and tasks, and show that conservative zero-shot RL algorithms outperform their non-conservative counterparts on low quality datasets, and perform no worse on high quality datasets. Somewhat surprisingly, our proposals also outperform baselines that get to see the task during training. Our code is available via the project page https://enjeeneer.io/projects/zero-shot-rl/."
Poster,Zero-Shot Scene Reconstruction from Single Images with Deep Prior Assembly,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95077,"Junsheng Zhou, Yu-Shen Liu, Zhizhong Han","Large language and vision models have been leading a revolution in visual computing. By greatly scaling up sizes of data and model parameters, the large models learn deep priors which lead to remarkable performance in various tasks. In this work, we present deep prior assembly, a novel framework that assembles diverse deep priors from large models for scene reconstruction from single images in a zero-shot manner. We show that this challenging task can be done without extra knowledge but just simply generalizing one deep prior in one sub-task. To this end, we introduce novel methods related to poses, scales, and occlusion parsing which are keys to enable deep priors to work together in a robust way. Deep prior assembly does not require any 3D or 2D data-driven training in the task and demonstrates superior performance in generalizing priors to open-world scenes. We conduct evaluations on various datasets, and report analysis, numerical and visual comparisons with the latest methods to show our superiority.

Poster,Zero-Shot Tokenizer Transfer,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95143,"Benjamin Minixhofer, Edoardo Maria Ponti, Ivan Vulić","Language models (LMs) are bound to their tokenizer, which maps raw text to a sequence of vocabulary items (tokens). This restricts their flexibility: for example, LMs trained primarily on English may still perform well in other natural and programming languages, but have vastly decreased efficiency due to their English-centric tokenizer. To mitigate this, we should be able to swap the original LM tokenizer with an arbitrary one, on the fly, without degrading performance. Hence, in this work we define a new problem: Zero-Shot Tokenizer Transfer (ZeTT). The challenge at the core of ZeTT is finding embeddings for the tokens in the vocabulary of the new tokenizer. Since prior heuristics for initializing embeddings often perform at chance level in a ZeTT setting, we propose a new solution: we train a hypernetwork taking a tokenizer as input and predicting the corresponding embeddings. We empirically demonstrate that the hypernetwork generalizes to new tokenizers both with encoder (e.g., XLM-R) and decoder LLMs (e.g., Mistral-7B). Our method comes close to the original models' performance in cross-lingual and coding tasks while markedly reducing the length of the tokenized sequence. We also find that the remaining gap can be quickly closed by continued training on less than 1B tokens. Finally, we show that a ZeTT hypernetwork trained for a base (L)LM can also be applied to fine-tuned variants without extra training. Overall, our results make substantial strides toward detaching LMs from their tokenizer."
