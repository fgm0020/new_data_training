Poster,MiSO: Optimizing brain stimulation to create neural activity states,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95894,"Yuki Minai, Joana Soldado-Magraner, Matthew Smith, Byron M Yu","Brain stimulation has the potential to create desired neural population activity states. However, it is challenging to search the large space of stimulation parameters, for example, selecting which subset of electrodes to be used for stimulation. In this scenario, creating a model that maps the configuration of stimulation parameters to the brain’s response can be beneficial. Training such an expansive model usually requires more stimulation-response samples than can be collected in a given experimental session. Furthermore, changes in the properties of the recorded activity over time can make it challenging to merge stimulation-response samples across sessions. To address these challenges, we propose MiSO (MicroStimulation Optimization), a closed-loop stimulation framework to drive neural population activity toward specified states by optimizing over a large stimulation parameter space. MiSO consists of three key components: 1) a neural activity alignment method to merge stimulation-response samples across sessions, 2) a statistical model trained on the merged samples to predict the brain's response to untested stimulation parameter configurations, and 3) an online optimization algorithm to adaptively update the stimulation parameter configuration based on the model's predictions. In this study, we implemented MiSO with a factor analysis (FA) based alignment method, a convolutional neural network (CNN), and an epsilon greedy optimization algorithm. We tested MiSO in closed-loop experiments using electrical microstimulation in the prefrontal cortex of a non-human primate. Guided by the CNN predictions, MiSO successfully searched amongst thousands of stimulation parameter configurations to drive the neural population activity toward specified states. More broadly, MiSO increases the clinical viability of neuromodulation technologies by enabling the use of many-fold larger stimulation parameter spaces."
Poster,Mission Impossible: A Statistical Perspective on Jailbreaking LLMs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94247,"Jingtong Su, Julia Kempe, Karen Ullrich","Large language models (LLMs) are trained on a deluge of text data with limited quality control. As a result, LLMs can exhibit unintended or even harmful behaviours, such as leaking information, fake news or hate speech. Countermeasures, commonly referred to as preference alignment, include fine-tuning the pretrained LLMs with carefully crafted text examples of desired behaviour. Even then, empirical evidence shows preference aligned LLMs can be enticed to harmful behaviour. This so called jailbreaking of LLMs is typically achieved by adversarially modifying the input prompt to the LLM. Our paper provides theoretical insights into the phenomenon of preference alignment and jailbreaking from a statistical perspective. Under our framework, we first show that pretrained LLMs will mimic harmful behaviour if present in the training corpus. \textbf{Under that same framework, we then introduce a statistical notion of alignment, and lower-bound the jailbreaking probability, showing that it is unpreventable under reasonable assumptions.} Based on our insights, we propose an alteration to the currently prevalent alignment strategy RLHF. Specifically, we introduce a  simple modification to the RLHF objective, we call \emph{E-RLHF}, that aims to increase the likelihood of safe responses. \emph{E-RLHF} brings no additional training cost, and is compatible with other methods. Empirically, we demonstrate that \emph{E-RLHF} outperforms RLHF on all alignment problems put forward by the AdvBench \citep{zou2023universal} and HarmBench project \citep{mazeika2024harmbench} without sacrificing model performance as measured by the MT-Bench project \citep{zheng2024judging}."
Poster,Mitigating Backdoor Attack by Injecting Proactive Defensive Backdoor,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94407,"Shaokui Wei, Hongyuan Zha, Baoyuan Wu","Data-poisoning backdoor attacks are serious security threats to machine learning models, where an adversary can manipulate the training dataset to inject backdoors into models. In this paper, we focus on in-training backdoor defense, aiming to train a clean model even when the dataset may be potentially poisoned. Unlike most existing methods that primarily detect and remove/unlearn suspicious samples to mitigate malicious backdoor attacks, we propose a novel defense approach called PDB (Proactive Defensive Backdoor). Specifically, PDB leverages the “home field” advantage of defenders by proactively injecting a defensive backdoor into the model during training. Taking advantage of controlling the training process, the defensive backdoor is designed to suppress the malicious backdoor effectively while remaining secret to attackers. In addition, we introduce a reversible mapping to determine the defensive target label. During inference, PDB embeds a defensive trigger in the inputs and reverses the model’s prediction, suppressing malicious backdoor and ensuring the model's utility on the original task. Experimental results across various datasets and models demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art defense performance against a wide range of backdoor attacks.

Poster,Mitigating Biases in Blackbox Feature Extractors for Image Classification Tasks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95798,"Abhipsa Basu, Saswat Subhajyoti Mallick, Venkatesh Babu R","In image classification, it is common to utilize a pretrained model to extract meaningful features of the input images, and then to train a classifier on top of it to make predictions for any downstream task. Trained on enormous amounts of data, these models have been shown to contain harmful biases which can hurt their performance when adapted for a downstream classification task. Further, very often they may be blackbox, either due to scale, or because of unavailability of model weights or architecture. Thus, during a downstream task, we cannot debias such models by updating the weights of the feature encoder, as only the classifier can be finetuned. In this regard, we investigate the suitability of some existing debiasing techniques and thereby motivate the need for more focused research towards this problem setting. Furthermore, we propose a simple method consisting of a clustering-based adaptive margin loss with a blackbox feature encoder, with no knowledge of the bias attribute. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across multiple benchmarks."
Poster,Mitigating Covariate Shift in Behavioral Cloning via Robust Stationary Distribution Correction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93841,"Seokin Seo, Byung-Jun Lee, Jongmin Lee, HyeongJoo Hwang, Hongseok Yang, Kee-Eung Kim","We consider offline imitation learning (IL), which aims to train an agent to imitate from the dataset of expert demonstrations without online interaction with the environment. Behavioral Cloning (BC) has been a simple yet effective approach to offline IL, but it is also well-known to be vulnerable to the covariate shift resulting from the mismatch between the state distributions induced by the learned policy and the expert policy. Moreover, as often occurs in practice, when expert datasets are collected from an arbitrary state distribution instead of a stationary one, these shifts become more pronounced, potentially leading to substantial failures in existing IL methods. Specifically, we focus on covariate shift resulting from arbitrary state data distributions, such as biased data collection or incomplete trajectories, rather than shifts induced by changes in dynamics or noisy expert actions. In this paper, to mitigate the effect of the covariate shifts in BC, we propose DrilDICE, which utilizes a distributionally robust BC objective by employing a stationary distribution correction ratio estimation (DICE) to derive a feasible solution. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method through an extensive set of experiments covering diverse covariate shift scenarios. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in improving the robustness against the shifts, outperforming existing offline IL methods in such scenarios."
Poster,Mitigating Object Hallucination via Concentric Causal Attention,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96152,"Yun Xing, Yiheng Li, Ivan Laptev, Shijian Lu","Recent Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) present remarkable zero-shot conversational and reasoning capabilities given multimodal queries. Nevertheless, they suffer from object hallucination, a phenomenon where LVLMs are prone to generate textual responses not factually aligned with image inputs. Our pilot study reveals that object hallucination is closely tied with Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), a widely adopted positional dependency modeling design in existing LVLMs. Due to the long-term decay in RoPE, LVLMs tend to hallucinate more when relevant visual cues are distant from instruction tokens in the multimodal input sequence, Additionally, we observe a similar effect when reversing the sequential order of visual tokens during multimodal alignment. Our tests indicate that long-term decay in RoPE poses challenges to LVLMs while capturing visual-instruction interactions across long distances. We propose Concentric Causal Attention (CCA), a simple yet effective positional alignment strategy that mitigates the impact of RoPE long-term decay in LVLMs by naturally reducing relative distance between visual and instruction tokens. With CCA, visual tokens can better interact with instruction tokens, thereby enhancing model's perception capability and alleviating object hallucination. Without bells and whistles, our positional alignment method surpasses existing hallucination mitigation strategies by large margins on multiple object hallucination benchmarks."
Poster,Mitigating Partial Observability in Sequential Decision Processes via the Lambda Discrepancy,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94689,"Cameron Allen, Aaron Kirtland, Ruo Yu Tao, Sam Lobel, Daniel Scott, Nicholas Petrocelli, Omer Gottesman, Ronald Parr, Michael Littman, George Konidaris","Reinforcement learning algorithms typically rely on the assumption that the environment dynamics and value function can be expressed in terms of a Markovian state representation. However, when state information is only partially observable, how can an agent learn such a state representation, and how can it detect when it has found one? We introduce a metric that can accomplish both objectives, without requiring access to---or knowledge of---an underlying, unobservable state space. Our metric, the λ-discrepancy, is the difference between two distinct temporal difference (TD) value estimates, each computed using TD(λ) with a different value of λ. Since TD(λ=0) makes an implicit Markov assumption and TD(λ=1) does not, a discrepancy between these estimates is a potential indicator of a non-Markovian state representation. Indeed, we prove that the λ-discrepancy is exactly zero for all Markov decision processes and almost always non-zero for a broad class of partially observable environments. We also demonstrate empirically that, once detected, minimizing the λ-discrepancy can help with learning a memory function to mitigate the corresponding partial observability. We then train a reinforcement learning agent that simultaneously constructs two recurrent value networks with different λ parameters and minimizes the difference between them as an auxiliary loss. The approach scales to challenging partially observable domains, where the resulting agent frequently performs significantly better (and never performs worse) than a baseline recurrent agent with only a single value network."
Poster,Mitigating Reward Overoptimization via Lightweight Uncertainty Estimation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93880,"Xiaoying Zhang, Jean-Francois Ton, Wei Shen, Hongning Wang, Yang Liu","Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been pivotal in aligning Large Language Models with human values but often suffers from overoptimization due to its reliance on a proxy reward model. To mitigate this limitation, we first propose a lightweight uncertainty quantification method that assesses the reliability of the proxy reward using only the last layer embeddings of the reward model. Enabled by this efficient uncertainty quantification method, we formulate AdvPO, a distributionally robust optimization procedure to tackle the reward overoptimization problem in RLHF. Through extensive experiments on the Anthropic HH and TL;DR summarization datasets, we verify the effectiveness of AdvPO in mitigating the overoptimization problem, resulting in enhanced RLHF performance as evaluated through human-assisted evaluation."
Poster,Mitigating Spurious Correlations via Disagreement Probability,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95358,"Hyeonggeun Han, Sehwan Kim, Hyungjun Joo, Sangwoo Hong, Jungwoo Lee","Models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) are prone to be biased towards spurious correlations between target labels and bias attributes, which leads to poor performance on data groups lacking spurious correlations. It is particularly challenging to address this problem when access to bias labels is not permitted. To mitigate the effect of spurious correlations without bias labels, we first introduce a novel training objective designed to robustly enhance model performance across all data samples, irrespective of the presence of spurious correlations. From this objective, we then derive a debiasing method, Disagreement Probability based Resampling for debiasing (DPR), which does not require bias labels. DPR leverages the disagreement between the target label and the prediction of a biased model to identify bias-conflicting samples—those without spurious correlations—and upsamples them according to the disagreement probability. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DPR achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines that do not use bias labels. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis that details how DPR reduces dependency on spurious correlations."
Poster,Mixed Dynamics In Linear Networks: Unifying the Lazy and Active Regimes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96286,"Zhenfeng Tu, Santiago Tomas Aranguri Diaz, Arthur Jacot","The training dynamics of linear networks are well studied in two distinctsetups: the lazy regime and balanced/active regime, depending on theinitialization and width of the network. We provide a surprisinglysimple unifying formula for the evolution of the learned matrix thatcontains as special cases both lazy and balanced regimes but alsoa mixed regime in between the two. In the mixed regime, a part ofthe network is lazy while the other is balanced. More precisely thenetwork is lazy along singular values that are below a certain thresholdand balanced along those that are above the same threshold. At initialization,all singular values are lazy, allowing for the network to align itselfwith the task, so that later in time, when some of the singular valuecross the threshold and become active they will converge rapidly (convergencein the balanced regime is notoriously difficult in the absence ofalignment). The mixed regime is the `best of both worlds': it convergesfrom any random initialization (in contrast to balanced dynamics whichrequire special initialization), and has a low rank bias (absent inthe lazy dynamics). This allows us to prove an almost complete phasediagram of training behavior as a function of the variance at initializationand the width, for a MSE training task."
