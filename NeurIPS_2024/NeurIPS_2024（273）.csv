Poster,Neural Collapse Inspired Feature Alignment for Out-of-Distribution Generalization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93156,"Zhikang Chen, Min Zhang, Sen Cui, Haoxuan Li, Gang Niu, Mingming Gong, Changshui Zhang, Kun Zhang","The spurious correlation between the background features of the image and its label arises due to that the samples labeled with the same class in the training set often co-occurs with a specific background, which will cause the encoder to extract non-semantic features for classification, resulting in poor out-of-distribution generalization performance. Although many studies have been proposed to address this challenge, the semantic and spurious features are still difficult to accurately decouple from the original image and fail to achieve high performance with deep learning models. This paper proposes a novel perspective inspired by neural collapse to solve the spurious correlation problem through the alternate execution of environment partitioning and learning semantic masks. Specifically, we propose to assign an environment to each sample by learning a local model for each environment and using maximum likelihood probability. At the same time, we require that the learned semantic mask neurally collapses to the same simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) in each environment after being applied to the original input. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method significantly improves out-of-distribution performance."
Poster,Neural Collapse To Multiple Centers For Imbalanced Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95181,"Hongren Yan, Yuhua Qian, Furong Peng, Jiachen Luo, zheqing zhu, Feijiang Li","Neural Collapse (NC) was a recently discovered phenomenon that the output features and the classifier weights of the neural network converge to optimal geometric structures at the Terminal Phase of Training (TPT) under various losses. However, the relationship between these optimal structures at TPT and the classification performance remains elusive, especially in imbalanced learning. Even though it is noticed that fixing the classifier to an optimal structure can mitigate the minority collapse problem, the performance is still not comparable to the classical imbalanced learning methods with a learnable classifier. In this work, we find that the optimal structure can be designed to represent a better classification rule, and thus achieve better performance. In particular, we justify that, to achieve better classification, the features from the minor classes should align with more directions.  This justification then yields a decision rule called the Generalized Classification Rule (GCR) and we also term these directions as the centers of the classes. Then we study the NC under an MSE-type loss via the Unconstrained Features Model (UFM) framework where (1) the features from a class tend to collapse to the mean of the corresponding centers of that class (named Neural Collapse to Multiple Centers (NCMC)) at the global optimum, and (2) the original classifier approximates a surrogate to GCR when NCMC occurs. Based on the analysis, we develop a strategy for determining the number of centers and propose a Cosine Loss function for the fixed classifier that induces NCMC. Our experiments have shown that the Cosine Loss can induce NCMC and has performance on long-tail classification comparable to the classical imbalanced learning methods."
Poster,Neural collapse vs. low-rank bias: Is deep neural collapse really optimal?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96913,"Peter Súkeník, Christoph Lampert, Marco Mondelli","Deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit a surprising structure in their final layer known as neural collapse (NC), and a growing body of works is currently investigated the propagation of neural collapse to earlier layers of DNNs -- a phenomenon called deep neural collapse (DNC). However, existing theoretical results are restricted to either linear models, the last two layers or binary classification. In contrast, we focus on non-linear models of arbitrary depth in multi-class classification and reveal a surprising qualitative shift. As soon as we go beyond two layers or two classes, DNC stops being optimal for the deep unconstrained features model (DUFM) -- the standard theoretical framework for the analysis of collapse. The main culprit is the low-rank bias of multi-layer regularization schemes. This bias leads to optimal solutions of even lower rank than the neural collapse. We support our theoretical findings with experiments on both DUFM and real data, which show the emergence of the low-rank structure in the solution found by gradient descent."
Poster,Neural Combinatorial Optimization for Robust Routing Problem with Uncertain Travel Times,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96075,"Pei Xiao, Zizhen Zhang, Jinbiao Chen, Jiahai Wang, Zhenzhen Zhang","We consider the robust routing problem with uncertain travel times under the min-max regret criterion, which represents an extended and robust version of the classic traveling salesman problem (TSP) and vehicle routing problem (VRP). The general budget uncertainty set is employed to capture the uncertainty, which provides the capability to control the conservatism of obtained solutions and covers the commonly used interval uncertainty set as a special case. The goal is to obtain a robust solution that minimizes the maximum deviation from the optimal routing time in the worst-case scenario. Given the significant advancements and broad applications of neural combinatorial optimization methods in recent years, we present our initial attempt to combine neural approaches for solving this problem. We propose a dual multi-head cross attention mechanism to extract problem features represented by the inputted uncertainty sets. To tackle the built-in maximization problem, we derive the regret value by invoking a pre-trained model, subsequently utilizing it as the reward during the model training. Our experimental results on the robust TSP and VRP demonstrate the efficacy of our neural combinatorial optimization method, showcasing its ability to efficiently handle the robust routing problem of various sizes within a shorter time compared with alternative heuristic approaches."
Poster,Neural Concept Binder,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92990,"Wolfgang Stammer, Antonia Wüst, David Steinmann, Kristian Kersting","The challenge in object-based visual reasoning lies in generating concept representations that are both descriptive and distinct. Achieving this in an unsupervised manner requires human users to understand the model's learned concepts and, if necessary, revise incorrect ones. To address this challenge, we introduce the Neural Concept Binder (NCB), a novel framework for deriving both discrete and continuous concept representations, which we refer to as ""concept-slot encodings"". NCB employs two types of binding: ""soft binding"", which leverages the recent SysBinder mechanism to obtain object-factor encodings, and subsequent ""hard binding"", achieved through hierarchical clustering and retrieval-based inference. This enables obtaining expressive, discrete representations from unlabeled images. Moreover, the structured nature of NCB's concept representations allows for intuitive inspection and the straightforward integration of external knowledge, such as human input or insights from other AI models like GPT-4. Additionally, we demonstrate that incorporating the hard binding mechanism preserves model performance while enabling seamless integration into both neural and symbolic modules for complex reasoning tasks. We validate the effectiveness of NCB through evaluations on our newly introduced CLEVR-Sudoku dataset."
Poster,Neural Conditional Probability for Uncertainty Quantification,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92949,"Vladimir Kostic, Grégoire Pacreau, Giacomo Turri, Pietro Novelli, Karim Lounici, Massimiliano Pontil","We introduce Neural Conditional Probability (NCP), an operator-theoretic approach to learning conditional distributions with a focus on statistical inference tasks. NCP can be used to build conditional confidence regions and extract key statistics such as conditional quantiles, mean, and covariance. It offers streamlined learning via a single unconditional training phase, allowing efficient inference without the need for retraining even when conditioning changes. By leveraging the approximation capabilities of neural networks, NCP efficiently handles a wide variety of complex probability distributions. We provide theoretical guarantees that ensure both optimization consistency and statistical accuracy. In experiments, we show that NCP with a 2-hidden-layer network matches or outperforms leading methods. This demonstrates that a a minimalistic architecture with a theoretically grounded loss can achieve competitive results,  even in the face of more complex architectures."
Poster,Neural Cover Selection for Image Steganography,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94996,"Karl Chahine, Hyeji Kim","In steganography, selecting an optimal cover image—referred to as cover selection—is pivotal for effective message concealment. Traditional methods have typically employed exhaustive searches to identify images that conform to specific perceptual or complexity metrics. However, the relationship between these metrics and the actual message hiding efficacy of an image is unclear, often yielding less-than-ideal steganographic outcomes. Inspired by recent advancements in generative models, we introduce a novel cover selection framework, which involves optimizing within the latent space of pretrained generative models to identify the most suitable cover images, distinguishing itself from traditional exhaustive search methods. Our method shows significant advantages in message recovery and image quality. We also conduct an information-theoretic analysis of the generated cover images, revealing that message hiding predominantly occurs in low-variance pixels, reflecting the waterfilling algorithm's principles in parallel Gaussian channels."
Poster,Neural decoding from stereotactic EEG: accounting for electrode variability across subjects,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95591,"Georgios Mentzelopoulos, Evangelos Chatzipantazis, Ashwin Ramayya, Michelle Hedlund, Vivek Buch, Kostas Daniilidis, Konrad Kording, Flavia Vitale","Deep learning based neural decoding from stereotactic electroencephalography (sEEG) would likely benefit from scaling up both dataset and model size. To achieve this, combining data across multiple subjects is crucial. However, in sEEG cohorts, each subject has a variable number of electrodes placed at distinct locations in their brain, solely based on clinical needs. Such heterogeneity in electrode number/placement poses a significant challenge for data integration, since there is no clear correspondence of the neural activity recorded at distinct sites between individuals. Here we introduce seegnificant: a training framework and architecture that can be used to decode behavior across subjects using sEEG data. We tokenize the neural activity within electrodes using convolutions and extract long-term temporal dependencies between tokens using self-attention in the time dimension. The 3D location of each electrode is then mixed with the tokens, followed by another self-attention in the electrode dimension to extract effective spatiotemporal neural representations. Subject-specific heads are then used for downstream decoding tasks. Using this approach, we construct a multi-subject model trained on the combined data from 21 subjects performing a behavioral task. We demonstrate that our model is able to decode the trial-wise response time of the subjects during the behavioral task solely from neural data. We also show that the neural representations learned by pretraining our model across individuals can be transferred in a few-shot manner to new subjects. This work introduces a scalable approach towards sEEG data integration for multi-subject model training, paving the way for cross-subject generalization for sEEG decoding."
Poster,Neural Embeddings Rank: Aligning 3D latent dynamics with movements,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95804,"Chenggang Chen, Zhiyu Yang, Xiaoqin Wang","Aligning neural dynamics with movements is a fundamental goal in neuroscience and brain-machine interfaces. However, there is still a lack of dimensionality reduction methods that can effectively align low-dimensional latent dynamics with movements. To address this gap, we propose Neural Embeddings Rank (NER), a technique that embeds neural dynamics into a 3D latent space and contrasts the embeddings based on movement ranks. NER learns to regress continuous representations of neural dynamics (i.e., embeddings) on continuous movements. We apply NER and six other dimensionality reduction techniques to neurons in the primary motor cortex (M1), dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), and primary somatosensory cortex (S1) as monkeys perform reaching tasks. Only NER aligns latent dynamics with both hand position and direction, visualizable in 3D. NER reveals consistent latent dynamics in M1 and PMd across sixteen sessions over a year. Using a linear regression decoder, NER explains 86\% and 97\% of the variance in velocity and position, respectively. Linear models trained on data from one session successfully decode velocity, position, and direction in held-out test data from different dates and cortical areas (64\%, 88\%, and 90\%). NER also reveals distinct latent dynamics in S1 during consistent movements and in M1 during curved reaching tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/NeuroscienceAI/NER."
Poster,Neural Experts: Mixture of Experts for Implicit Neural Representations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93148,"Yizhak Ben-Shabat, Chamin Hewa Koneputugodage, Sameera Ramasinghe, Stephen Gould","Implicit neural representations (INRs) have proven effective in various tasks including image, shape, audio, and video reconstruction. These INRs typically learn the implicit field from sampled input points. This is often done using a single network for the entire domain, imposing many global constraints on a single function. In this paper, we propose a mixture of experts (MoE) implicit neural representation approach that enables learning local piece-wise continuous functions that simultaneously learns to subdivide the domain and fit it locally. We show that incorporating a mixture of experts architecture into existing INR formulations provides a boost in speed, accuracy, and memory requirements. Additionally, we introduce novel conditioning and pretraining methods for the gating network that improves convergence to the desired solution. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on multiple reconstruction tasks, including surface reconstruction, image reconstruction, and audio signal reconstruction and show improved performance compared to non-MoE methods.
