Poster,Generative Modeling of Molecular Dynamics Trajectories,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93022,"Bowen Jing, Hannes Stärk, Tommi Jaakkola, Bonnie Berger","Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful technique for studying microscopic phenomena, but its computational cost has driven significant interest in the development of deep learning-based surrogate models. We introduce generative modeling of molecular trajectories as a paradigm for learning flexible multi-task surrogate models of MD from data. By conditioning on appropriately chosen frames of the trajectory, we show such generative models can be adapted to diverse tasks such as forward simulation, transition path sampling, and trajectory upsampling. By alternatively conditioning on part of the molecular system and inpainting the rest, we also demonstrate the first steps towards dynamics-conditioned molecular design. We validate the full set of these capabilities on tetrapeptide simulations and show preliminary results on scaling to protein monomers. Altogether, our work illustrates how generative modeling can unlock value from MD data towards diverse downstream tasks that are not straightforward to address with existing methods or even MD itself.

Poster,Generative Modelling of Structurally Constrained Graphs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96282,"Manuel Madeira, Clement Vignac, Dorina Thanou, Pascal Frossard","Graph diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art techniques in graph generation; yet, integrating domain knowledge into these models remains challenging. Domain knowledge is particularly important in real-world scenarios, where invalid generated graphs hinder deployment in practical applications.Unconstrained and conditioned graph diffusion models fail to guarantee such domain-specific structural properties. We present ConStruct, a novel framework that enables graph diffusion models to incorporate hard constraints on specific properties, such as planarity or acyclicity.Our approach ensures that the sampled graphs remain within the domain of graphs that satisfy the specified property throughout the entire trajectory in both the forward and reverse processes. This is achieved by introducing an edge-absorbing noise model and a new projector operator.ConStruct demonstrates versatility across several structural and edge-deletion invariant constraints and achieves state-of-the-art performance for both synthetic benchmarks and attributed real-world datasets. For example, by incorporating planarity constraints in digital pathology graph datasets, the proposed method outperforms existing baselines, improving data validity by up to 71.1 percentage points."
Poster,Generative Retrieval Meets Multi-Graded Relevance,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96782,"Yubao Tang, Ruqing Zhang, Jiafeng Guo, Maarten Rijke, Wei Chen, Xueqi Cheng","Generative retrieval represents a novel approach to information retrieval, utilizing an encoder-decoder architecture to directly produce relevant document identifiers (docids) for queries. While this method offers benefits, current implementations are limited to scenarios with binary relevance data, overlooking the potential for documents to have multi-graded relevance. Extending generative retrieval to accommodate multi-graded relevance poses challenges, including the need to reconcile likelihood probabilities for docid pairs and the possibility of multiple relevant documents sharing the same identifier. To address these challenges, we introduce a new framework called GRaded Generative Retrieval (GR$^2$). Our approach focuses on two key components: ensuring relevant and distinct identifiers, and implementing multi-graded constrained contrastive training. Firstly, we aim to create identifiers that are both semantically relevant and sufficiently distinct to represent individual documents effectively. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the relevance and distinctness of docids through a combination of docid generation and autoencoder models. Secondly, we incorporate information about the relationship between relevance grades to guide the training process. Specifically, we leverage a constrained contrastive training strategy to bring the representations of queries and the identifiers of their relevant documents closer together, based on their respective relevance grades.Extensive experiments on datasets with both multi-graded and binary relevance demonstrate the effectiveness of our method."
Poster,Generative Semi-supervised Graph Anomaly Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92932,"Hezhe Qiao, Qingsong Wen, Xiaoli Li, Ee-peng Lim, Guansong Pang","This work considers a practical semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) scenario, where part of the nodes in a graph are known to be normal, contrasting to the extensively explored unsupervised setting with a fully unlabeled graph. We reveal that having access to the normal nodes, even just a small percentage of normal nodes, helps enhance the detection performance of existing unsupervised GAD methods when they are adapted to the semi-supervised setting. However, their utilization of these normal nodes is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel Generative GAD approach (namely GGAD) for the semi-supervised scenario to better exploit the normal nodes. The key idea is to generate pseudo anomaly nodes, referred to as 'outlier nodes', for providing effective negative node samples in training a discriminative one-class classifier. The main challenge here lies in the lack of ground truth information about real anomaly nodes. To address this challenge, GGAD is designed to leverage two important priors about the anomaly nodes -- asymmetric local affinity and egocentric closeness -- to generate reliable outlier nodes that assimilate anomaly nodes in both graph structure and feature representations. Comprehensive experiments on six real-world GAD datasets are performed to establish a benchmark for semi-supervised GAD and show that GGAD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised GAD methods with varying numbers of training normal nodes."
Poster,Generic Unsupervised Optimization for a Latent Variable Model With Exponential Family Observables,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/98325,"Hamid Mousavi, Jakob Drefs, Florian Hirschberger, Jörg Lücke","Latent variable models (LVMs) represent observed variables by parameterized functions of latent variables. Prominent examples of LVMs for unsupervised learning are probabilistic PCA or probabilistic sparse coding which both assume a weighted linear summation of the latents to determine the mean of a Gaussian distribution for the observables. In many cases, however, observables do not follow a Gaussian distribution. For unsupervised learning, LVMs which assume specific non-Gaussian observables (e.g., Bernoulli or Poisson) have therefore been considered. Already for specific choices of distributions, parameter optimization is challenging and only a few previous contributions considered LVMs with more generally defined observable distributions. In this contribution, we do consider LVMs that are defined for a range of different distributions, i.e., observables can follow any (regular) distribution of the exponential family. Furthermore, the novel class of LVMs presented here is defined for binary latents, and it uses maximization in place of summation to link the latents to observables. In order to derive an optimization procedure, we follow an expectation maximization approach for maximum likelihood parameter estimation. We then show, as our main result, that a set of very concise parameter update equations can be derived which feature the same functional form for all exponential family distributions. The derived generic optimization can consequently be applied (without further derivations) to different types of metric data (Gaussian and non-Gaussian) as well as to different types of discrete data. Moreover, the derived optimization equations can be combined with a recently suggested variational acceleration which is likewise generically applicable to the LVMs considered here. Thus, the combination maintains generic and direct applicability of the derived optimization procedure, but, crucially, enables efficient scalability. We numerically verify our analytical results using different observable distributions, and, furthermore, discuss some potential applications such as learning of variance structure, noise type estimation and denoising."
Poster,Genetic-guided GFlowNets for Sample Efficient Molecular Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96215,"Hyeonah Kim, Minsu Kim, Sanghyeok Choi, Jinkyoo Park","The challenge of discovering new molecules with desired properties is crucial in domains like drug discovery and material design. Recent advances in deep learning-based generative methods have shown promise but face the issue of sample efficiency due to the computational expense of evaluating the reward function. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for sample-efficient molecular optimization by distilling a powerful genetic algorithm into deep generative policy using GFlowNets training, the off-policy method for amortized inference. This approach enables the deep generative policy to learn from domain knowledge, which has been explicitly integrated into the genetic algorithm. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the official molecular optimization benchmark, significantly outperforming previous methods. It also demonstrates effectiveness in designing inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 with substantially fewer reward calls."
Poster,GENOT: Entropic (Gromov) Wasserstein Flow Matching with Applications to Single-Cell Genomics,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94046,"Dominik Klein, Théo Uscidda, Fabian Theis, Marco Cuturi","Single-cell genomics has significantly advanced our understanding of cellular behavior, catalyzing innovations in treatments and precision medicine. However,single-cell sequencing technologies are inherently destructive and can only measure a limited array of data modalities simultaneously. This limitation underscoresthe need for new methods capable of realigning cells. Optimal transport (OT)has emerged as a potent solution, but traditional discrete solvers are hampered byscalability, privacy, and out-of-sample estimation issues. These challenges havespurred the development of neural network-based solvers, known as neural OTsolvers, that parameterize OT maps. Yet, these models often lack the flexibilityneeded for broader life science applications. To address these deficiencies, ourapproach learns stochastic maps (i.e. transport plans), allows for any cost function,relaxes mass conservation constraints and integrates quadratic solvers to tackle thecomplex challenges posed by the (Fused) Gromov-Wasserstein problem. Utilizingflow matching as a backbone, our method offers a flexible and effective framework.We demonstrate its versatility and robustness through applications in cell development studies, cellular drug response modeling, and cross-modality cell translation,illustrating significant potential for enhancing therapeutic strategies."
Poster,GenRec: Unifying Video Generation and Recognition with Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94684,"Zejia Weng, Xitong Yang, Zhen Xing, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang","Video diffusion models are able to generate high-quality videos by learning strong spatial-temporal priors on large-scale datasets. In this paper, we aim to investigate whether such priors derived from a generative process are suitable for video recognition, and eventually joint optimization of generation and recognition. Building upon Stable Video Diffusion, we introduce GenRec, the first unified framework trained with a random-frame conditioning process so as to learn generalized spatial-temporal representations. The resulting framework can naturally supports generation and recognition, and more importantly is robust even when visual inputs contain limited information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of GenRec for both recognition and generation. In particular, GenRec achieves competitive recognition performance, offering 75.8% and 87.2% accuracy on SSV2 and K400, respectively. GenRec also performs the best on class-conditioned image-to-video generation, achieving 46.5 and 49.3 FVD scores on SSV2 and EK-100 datasets. Furthermore, GenRec demonstrates extraordinary robustness in scenarios that only limited frames can be observed. Code will be available at https://github.com/wengzejia1/GenRec."
Poster,GenRL: Multimodal-foundation world models for generalization in embodied agents,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92947,"Pietro Mazzaglia, Tim Verbelen, Bart Dhoedt, Aaron Courville, Sai Rajeswar Mudumba","Learning generalist embodied agents, able to solve multitudes of tasks in different domains is a long-standing problem. Reinforcement learning (RL) is hard to scale up as it requires a complex reward design for each task. In contrast, language can specify tasks in a more natural way. Current foundation vision-language models (VLMs) generally require fine-tuning or other adaptations to be adopted in embodied contexts, due to the significant domain gap. However, the lack of multimodal data in such domains represents an obstacle to developing foundation models for embodied applications. In this work, we overcome these problems by presenting multimodal-foundation world models, able to connect and align the representation of foundation VLMs with the latent space of generative world models for RL, without any language annotations. The resulting agent learning framework, GenRL, allows one to specify tasks through vision and/or language prompts, ground them in the embodied domain’s dynamics, and learn the corresponding behaviors in imagination.As assessed through large-scale multi-task benchmarking in locomotion and manipulation domains, GenRL enables multi-task generalization from language and visual prompts. Furthermore, by introducing a data-free policy learning strategy, our approach lays the groundwork for foundational policy learning using generative world models.

Poster,GenWarp: Single Image to Novel Views with Semantic-Preserving Generative Warping,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93442,"Junyoung Seo, Kazumi Fukuda, Takashi Shibuya, Takuya Narihira, Naoki Murata, Shoukang Hu, Chieh-Hsin Lai, Seungryong Kim, Yuki Mitsufuji","Generating novel views from a single image remains a challenging task due to the complexity of 3D scenes and the limited diversity in the existing multi-view datasets to train a model on. Recent research combining large-scale text-to-image (T2I) models with monocular depth estimation (MDE) has shown promise in handling in-the-wild images. In these methods, an input view is geometrically warped to novel views with estimated depth maps, then the warped image is inpainted by T2I models. However, they struggle with noisy depth maps and loss of semantic details when warping an input view to novel viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for single-shot novel view synthesis, a semantic-preserving generative warping framework that enables T2I generative models to learn where to warp and where to generate, through augmenting cross-view attention with self-attention. Our approach addresses the limitations of existing methods by conditioning the generative model on source view images and incorporating geometric warping signals. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios.
