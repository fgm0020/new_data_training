Poster,Nimbus: Secure and Efficient Two-Party Inference for Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95926,"Zhengyi Li, Kang Yang, Jin Tan, Wen-jie Lu, Haoqi Wu, Xiao Wang, Yu Yu, Derun Zhao, Yancheng Zheng, Minyi Guo, Jingwen Leng","Transformer models have gained significant attention due to their power in machine learning tasks. Their extensive deployment has raised concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive information during inference. However, when being applied to Transformers, existing approaches based on secure two-party computation (2PC) bring about efficiency limitations in two folds: (1) resource-intensive matrix multiplications in linear layers, and (2) complex non-linear activation functions like $\mathsf{GELU}$ and $\mathsf{Softmax}$. This work presents a new two-party inference framework $\mathsf{Nimbus}$ for Transformer models. Specifically, we propose a new 2PC paradigm to securely compute matrix multiplications based on an outer-product insight, which achieves $2.9\times \sim 12.5\times$ performance improvements compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) protocol. Furthermore, through a new observation of utilizing the input distribution, we propose an approach of low-degree polynomial approximation for $\mathsf{GELU}$ and $\mathsf{Softmax}$, which improves the performance of the SOTA polynomial approximation by $2.9\times \sim 4.0\times$, where the average accuracy loss of our approach is 0.08\% compared to the non-2PC inference without privacy. Compared with the SOTA two-party inference, $\mathsf{Nimbus}$ improves the end-to-end performance of $BERT_{base}$ inference by $2.7\times \sim 4.7\times$ across different network settings."
Poster,NN4SysBench: Characterizing Neural Network Verification for Computer Systems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97516,"Shuyi Lin, Haoyu He, Tianhao WEI, Kaidi Xu, Huan Zhang, Gagandeep Singh, Changliu Liu, Cheng Tan","We present NN4SysBench, a benchmark suite for neural network verification that is composed of applications from the domain of computer systems. We call these neural networks for computer systems or NN4Sys. NN4Sys is booming: there are many proposals for using neural networks in computer systems—for example, databases, OSes, and networked systems—many of which are safety critical. Neural network verification is a technique to formally verify whether neural networks satisfy safety properties. We however observe that NN4Sys has some unique characteristics that today’s verification tools overlook and have limited support. Therefore, this benchmark suite aims at bridging the gap between NN4Sys and the verification by using impactful NN4Sys applications as benchmarks to illustrate computer systems’ unique challenges. We also build a compatible version of NN4SysBench, so that today’s verifiers can also work on these benchmarks with approximately the same verification difficulties. The code is available at https://github.com/lydialin1212/NN4Sys_Benchmark."
Poster,Noether's Razor: Learning Conserved Quantities,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94316,"Tycho van der Ouderaa, Mark van der Wilk, Pim de Haan","Symmetries have proven useful in machine learning models, improving generalisation and overall performance. At the same time, recent advancements in learning dynamical systems rely on modelling the underlying Hamiltonian to guarantee the conservation of energy.These approaches can be connected via a seminal result in mathematical physics: Noether's theorem, which states that symmetries in a dynamical system correspond to conserved quantities.This work uses Noether's theorem to parameterise symmetries as learnable conserved quantities. We then allow conserved quantities and associated symmetries to be learned directly from train data through approximate Bayesian model selection, jointly with the regular training procedure. As training objective, we derive a variational lower bound to the marginal likelihood. The objective automatically embodies an Occam's Razor effect that avoids collapse of conversation laws to the trivial constant, without the need to manually add and tune additional regularisers. We demonstrate a proof-of-principle on n-harmonic oscillators and n-body systems. We find that our method correctly identifies the correct conserved quantities and U(n) and SE(n) symmetry groups, improving overall performance and predictive accuracy on test data."
Poster,No Filter: Cultural and Socioeconomic Diversity in Contrastive Vision-Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94944,"Angéline Pouget, Lucas Beyer, Emanuele Bugliarello, Xiao Wang, Andreas Steiner, Xiaohua Zhai, Ibrahim Alabdulmohsin","We study cultural and socioeconomic diversity in contrastive vision-language models (VLMs). Using a broad range of benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, we bring to attention several important findings. First, the common filtering of training data to English image-text pairs disadvantages communities of lower socioeconomic status and negatively impacts cultural understanding. Notably, this performance gap is not captured by - and even at odds with - the currently popular evaluation metrics derived from the Western-centric ImageNet and COCO datasets. Second, pretraining with global, unfiltered data before fine-tuning on English content can improve cultural understanding without sacrificing performance on said popular benchmarks. Third, we introduce the task of geo-localization as a novel evaluation metric to assess cultural diversity in VLMs. Our work underscores the value of using diverse data to create more inclusive multimodal systems and lays the groundwork for developing VLMs that better represent global perspectives."
Poster,No Free Delivery Service: Epistemic limits of passive data collection in complex social systems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94758,Maximilian Nickel,"Rapid model validation via the train-test paradigm has been a key driver for the breathtaking progress in machine learning and AI. However, modern AI systems often depend on a combination of tasks and data collection practices that violate all assumptions ensuring test validity. Yet, without rigorous model validation we cannot ensure the intended outcomes of deployed AI systems, including positive social impact, nor continue to advance AI research in a scientiﬁcally sound way. In this paper, I will show that for widely considered inference settings in complex social systems the train-test paradigm does not only lack a justiﬁcation but is indeed invalid for any risk estimator, including counterfactual and causal estimators, with high probability. These formal impossibility results highlight a fundamental epistemic issue, i.e., that for key tasks in modern AI we cannot know whether models are valid under current data collection practices. Importantly, this includes variants of both recommender systems and reasoning via large language models, and neither naïve scaling nor limited benchmarks are suited to address this issue. I am illustrating these results via the widely used MovieLens benchmark and conclude by discussing the implications of these results for AI in social systems, including possible remedies such as participatory data curation and open science."
Poster,No Free Lunch in LLM Watermarking: Trade-offs in Watermarking Design Choices,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93444,"Qi Pang, Shengyuan Hu, Wenting Zheng, Virginia Smith","Advances in generative models have made it possible for AI-generated text, code, and images to mirror human-generated content in many applications. Watermarking, a technique that aims to embed information in the output of a model to verify its source, is useful for mitigating the misuse of such AI-generated content. However, we show that common design choices in LLM watermarking schemes make the resulting systems  surprisingly susceptible to attack---leading to fundamental trade-offs in robustness, utility, and usability. To navigate these trade-offs, we rigorously study a set of simple yet effective attacks on common watermarking systems, and propose  guidelines and defenses for LLM watermarking in practice."
Poster,No Free Lunch Theorem and Black-Box Complexity Analysis for Adversarial Optimisation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95414,"Per Kristian Lehre, Shishen Lin","Black-box optimisation is one of the important areas in optimisation. The original No Free Lunch (NFL) theorems highlight the limitations of traditional black-box optimisation and learning algorithms, serving as a theoretical foundation for traditional optimisation. No Free Lunch Analysis in adversarial (also called maximin) optimisation is a long-standing problem [45 , 46]. This paper first rigorously proves a (NFL) Theorem for general black-box adversarial optimisation when considering Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium (NE) as the solution concept. We emphasise the solution concept (i.e. define the optimality in adversarial optimisation) as the key in our NFL theorem. In particular, if Nash Equilibrium is considered as the solution concept and the cost of the algorithm is measured in terms of the number of columns and rows queried in the payoff matrix, then the average performance of all black-box adversarial optimisation algorithms is the same. Moreover, we first introduce black-box complexity to analyse the black-box adversarial optimisation algorithm. We employ Yao’s Principle and our new NFL Theorem to provide general lower bounds for the query complexity of finding a Nash Equilibrium in adversarial optimisation. Finally, we illustrate the practical ramifications of our results on simple two-player zero-sum games. More specifically, no black-box optimisation algorithm for finding the unique Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum games can exceed logarithmic complexity relative to search space size. Meanwhile, no black-box algorithm can solve any bimatrix game with unique NE with fewer than a linear number of queries in the size of the payoff matrix."
Poster,Noise-Aware Differentially Private Regression via Meta-Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96324,"Ossi Räisä, Stratis Markou, Matthew Ashman, Wessel Bruinsma, Marlon Tobaben, Antti Honkela, Richard Turner","Many high-stakes applications require machine learning models that protect user privacy and provide well-calibrated, accurate predictions. While Differential Privacy (DP) is the gold standard for protecting user privacy, standard DP mechanisms typically significantly impair performance. One approach to mitigating this issue is pre-training models on simulated data before DP learning on the private data. In this work we go a step further, using simulated data to train a meta-learning model that combines the Convolutional Conditional Neural Process (ConvCNP) with an improved functional DP mechanism of Hall et al. (2013), yielding the DPConvCNP. DPConvCNP learns from simulated data how to map private data to a DP predictive model in one forward pass, and then provides accurate, well-calibrated predictions. We compare DPConvCNP with a DP Gaussian Process (GP) baseline with carefully tuned hyperparameters. The DPConvCNP outperforms the GP baseline, especially on non-Gaussian data, yet is much faster at test time and requires less tuning."
Poster,Noise Contrastive Alignment of Language Models with Explicit Rewards,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95633,"Huayu Chen, Guande He, Lifan Yuan, Ganqu Cui, Hang Su, Jun Zhu","User intentions are typically formalized as evaluation rewards to be maximized when fine-tuning language models (LMs). Existing alignment methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), are mainly tailored for pairwise preference data where rewards are implicitly defined rather than explicitly given. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for LM alignment, leveraging Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) to bridge the gap in handling reward datasets explicitly annotated with scalar evaluations. Our framework comprises two parallel algorithms, NCA and InfoNCA, both enabling the direct extraction of an LM policy from reward data as well as preference data. Notably, we show that the DPO loss is a special case of our proposed InfoNCA objective under pairwise preference settings, thereby integrating and extending current alignment theories. By comparing NCA and InfoNCA, we demonstrate that the well-observed decreasing-likelihood trend of DPO/InfoNCA is caused by their focus on adjusting relative likelihood across different responses.In contrast, NCA optimizes the absolute likelihood for each response, thereby effectively preventing the chosen likelihood from decreasing. We evaluate our methods in both reward and preference settings with Mistral-8$\times$7B and 7B models. Experiments suggest that InfoNCA/NCA surpasses various preference baselines when reward datasets are available. We also find NCA significantly outperforms DPO in complex reasoning tasks like math and coding."
Poster,NoiseGPT: Label Noise Detection and Rectification through Probability Curvature,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94898,"Haoyu Wang, Zhuo Huang, Zhiwei Lin, Tongliang Liu","Machine learning craves high-quality data which is a major bottleneck during realistic deployment, as it takes abundant resources and massive human labor to collect and label data. Unfortunately, label noise where image data mismatches with incorrect label exists ubiquitously in all kinds of datasets, significantly degrading the learning performance of deep networks. Learning with Label Noise (LNL) has been a common strategy for mitigating the influence of noisy labels. However, existing LNL methods either require pertaining using the memorization effect to separate clean data from noisy ones or rely on dataset assumptions that cannot extend to various scenarios. Thanks to the development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) which possess massive knowledge and hold In-Context Learning (ICL) ability, this paper proposes NoiseGPT to effectively leverage MLLMs as a knowledge expert for conducting label noise detection and rectification. Specifically, we observe a \textit{probability curvature} effect of MLLMs where clean and noisy examples reside on curvatures with different smoothness, further enabling the detection of label noise. By designing a token-wise Mix-of-Feature (MoF) technique to produce the curvature, we propose an In-Context Discrepancy (ICD) measure to determine the authenticity of an image-label pair. Subsequently, we repeat such a process to find the best matching pairs to complete our label rectification. Through extensive experiments, we carefully demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseGPT on detecting and cleansing dataset noise, especially on ILSVRC12, the AUROC of NoiseGPT reached over 0.92. And by integrating with existing methods, the classification performance can be significantly improved on noisy datasets, typically by 22.8\% on 80\% symmetric CIFAR-10 with M-correction.
