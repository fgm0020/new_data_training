Poster,Multi-scale Consistency for Robust 3D Registration via Hierarchical Sinkhorn Tree,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93381,"Chengwei Ren, Yifan Feng, Weixiang Zhang, Xiao-Ping (Steven) Zhang, Yue Gao","We study the problem of retrieving accurate correspondence through multi-scale consistency (MSC) for robust point cloud registration. Existing works in a coarse-to-fine manner either suffer from severe noisy correspondences caused by unreliable coarse matching or struggle to form outlier-free coarse-level correspondence sets. To tackle this, we present Hierarchical Sinkhorn Tree (HST), a pruned tree structure designed to hierarchically measure the local consistency of each coarse correspondence across multiple feature scales, thereby filtering out the local dissimilar ones. In this way, we convert the modeling of MSC for each correspondence into a BFS traversal with pruning of a K-ary tree rooted at the superpoint, with its K nearest neighbors in the feature pyramid serving as child nodes. To achieve efficient pruning and accurate vicinity characterization, we further propose a novel overlap-aware Sinkhorn Distance, which retains only the most likely overlapping points for local measurement and next level exploration. The modeling process essentially involves traversing a pair of HSTs synchronously and aggregating the consistency measures of corresponding tree nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate HST consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both indoor and outdoor benchmarks."
Poster,Multi-Scale Representation Learning for Protein Fitness Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93883,"Zuobai Zhang, Pascal Notin, Yining Huang, Aurelie Lozano, Vijil Chenthamarakshan, Debora Marks, Payel Das, Jian Tang","Designing novel functional proteins crucially depends on accurately modeling their fitness landscape. Given the limited availability of functional annotations from wet-lab experiments, previous methods have primarily relied on self-supervised models trained on vast, unlabeled protein sequence or structure datasets. While initial protein representation learning studies solely focused on either sequence or structural features, recent hybrid architectures have sought to merge these modalities to harness their respective strengths. However, these sequence-structure models have so far achieved only incremental improvements when compared to the leading sequence-only approaches, highlighting unresolved challenges effectively leveraging these modalities together. Moreover, the function of certain proteins is highly dependent on the granular aspects of their surface topology, which have been overlooked by prior models.To address these limitations, we introduce the Sequence-Structure-Surface Fitness (**S3F**) model — a novel multimodal representation learning framework that integrates protein features across several scales. Our approach combines sequence representations from a protein language model with Geometric Vector Perceptron networks encoding protein backbone and detailed surface topology. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art fitness prediction on the ProteinGym benchmark encompassing 217 substitution deep mutational scanning assays, and provides insights into the determinants of protein function.Our code is at https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/S3F."
Poster,Multi-Scale VMamba: Hierarchy in Hierarchy Visual State Space Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93455,"Yuheng Shi, Minjing Dong, Chang Xu","Despite the significant achievements of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in various vision tasks, they are constrained by the quadratic complexity. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs) have garnered widespread attention due to their global receptive field and linear complexity with respect to the input length, demonstrating substantial potential across fields including natural language processing and computer vision. To improve the performance of SSMs in vision tasks, a multi-scan strategy is widely adopted, which leads to significant redundancy of SSMs. For a better trade-off between efficiency and performance, we analyze the underlying reasons behind the success of the multi-scan strategy, where long-range dependency plays an important role. Based on the analysis, we introduce Multi-Scale Vision Mamba (MSVMamba) to preserve the superiority of SSMs in vision tasks with limited parameters. It employs a multi-scale 2D scanning technique on both original and downsampled feature maps, which not only benefits long-range dependency learning but also reduces computational costs. Additionally, we integrate a Convolutional Feed-Forward Network (ConvFFN) to address the lack of channel mixing. Our experiments demonstrate that MSVMamba is highly competitive, with the MSVMamba-Tiny model achieving 83.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 46.9% box mAP, and 42.5% instance mAP with the Mask R-CNN framework, 1x training schedule on COCO, and 47.9% mIoU with single-scale testing on ADE20K.  Code is available at https://github.com/YuHengsss/MSVMamba."
Poster,Multistable Shape from Shading Emerges from Patch Diffusion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94470,"Xinran Han, Todd Zickler, Ko Nishino","Models for inferring monocular shape of surfaces with diffuse reflection---shape from shading---ought to produce distributions of outputs, because there are fundamental mathematical ambiguities of both continuous (e.g., bas-relief) and discrete (e.g., convex/concave) types that are also experienced by humans. Yet, the outputs of current models are limited to point estimates or tight distributions around single modes, which prevent them from capturing these effects. We introduce a model that reconstructs a multimodal distribution of shapes from a single shading image, which aligns with the human experience of multistable perception. We train a small denoising diffusion process to generate surface normal fields from $16\times 16$ patches of synthetic images of everyday 3D objects. We deploy this model patch-wise at multiple scales, with guidance from inter-patch shape consistency constraints. Despite its relatively small parameter count and predominantly bottom-up structure, we show that multistable shape explanations emerge from this model for ambiguous test images that humans experience as being multistable. At the same time, the model produces veridical shape estimates for object-like images that include distinctive occluding contours and appear less ambiguous. This may inspire new architectures for stochastic 3D shape perception that are more efficient and better aligned with human experience."
Poster,Multi-Stage Predict+Optimize for (Mixed Integer) Linear Programs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93545,"Xinyi HU, Jasper C.H. Lee, Jimmy Lee, Peter Stuckey","The recently-proposed framework of Predict+Optimize tackles optimization problems with parameters that are unknown at solving time, in a supervised learning setting. Prior frameworks consider only the scenario where all unknown parameters are (eventually) revealed simultaneously. In this work, we propose Multi-Stage Predict+Optimize, a novel extension catering to applications where unknown parameters are revealed in sequential stages, with optimization decisions made in between. We further develop three training algorithms for neural networks (NNs) for our framework as proof of concept, both of which handle all mixed integer linear programs. The first baseline algorithm is a natural extension of prior work, training a single NN which makes a single prediction of unknown parameters. The second and third algorithms instead leverage the possibility of updating parameter predictions between stages, and trains one NN per stage. To handle the interdependency between the neural networks, we adopt sequential and parallelized versions of coordinate descent for training. Experimentation on three benchmarks demonstrates the superior learning performance of our methods over classical approaches."
Poster,Multistep Distillation of Diffusion Models via Moment Matching,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96160,"Tim Salimans, Thomas Mensink, Jonathan Heek, Emiel Hoogeboom","We present a new method for making diffusion models faster to sample. The method distills many-step diffusion models into few-step models by matching conditional expectations of the clean data given noisy data along the sampling trajectory. Our approach extends recently proposed one-step methods to the multi-step case, and provides a new perspective by interpreting these approaches in terms of moment matching. By using up to 8 sampling steps, we obtain distilled models that outperform not only their one-step versions but also their original many-step teacher models, obtaining new state-of-the-art results on the Imagenet dataset. We also show promising results on a large text-to-image model where we achieve fast generation of high resolution images directly in image space, without needing autoencoders or upsamplers."
Poster,Multi-times Monte Carlo Rendering for Inter-reflection Reconstruction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95040,"Tengjie Zhu, Zhuo Chen, Jingnan Gao, Yichao Yan, Xiaokang Yang","Inverse rendering methods have achieved remarkable performance in reconstructing high-fidelity 3D objects with disentangled geometries, materials, and environmental light. However, they still face huge challenges in reflective surface reconstruction. Although recent methods model the light trace to learn specularity, the ignorance of indirect illumination makes it hard to handle inter-reflections among multiple smooth objects. In this work, we propose Ref-MC2 that introduces the multi-time Monte Carlo sampling which comprehensively computes the environmental illumination and meanwhile considers the reflective light from object surfaces. To address the computation challenge as the times of Monte Carlo sampling grow, we propose a specularity-adaptive sampling strategy, significantly reducing the computational complexity. Besides the computational resource, higher geometry accuracy is also required because geometric errors accumulate multiple times. Therefore, we further introduce a reflection-aware surface model to initialize the geometry and refine it during inverse rendering. We construct a challenging dataset containing scenes with multiple objects and inter-reflections. Experiments show that our method outperforms other inverse rendering methods on various object groups. We also show downstream applications, e.g., relighting and material editing, to illustrate the disentanglement ability of our method."
Poster,MultiTrust: A Comprehensive Benchmark Towards Trustworthy Multimodal Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97845,"Yichi Zhang, Yao Huang, Yitong Sun, Chang Liu, Zhe Zhao, Zhengwei Fang, Yifan Wang, Huanran Chen, Xiao Yang, Xingxing Wei, Hang Su, Yinpeng Dong, Jun Zhu","Despite the superior capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, they still face significant trustworthiness challenges. Yet, current literature on the assessment of trustworthy MLLMs remains limited, lacking a holistic evaluation to offer thorough insights into future improvements. In this work, we establish **MultiTrust**, the first comprehensive and unified benchmark on the trustworthiness of MLLMs across five primary aspects: *truthfulness*, *safety*, *robustness*, *fairness*, and *privacy*. Our benchmark employs a rigorous evaluation strategy that addresses both multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts, encompassing 32 diverse tasks with self-curated datasets. Extensive experiments with 21 modern MLLMs reveal some previously unexplored trustworthiness issues and risks, highlighting the complexities introduced by the multimodality and underscoring the necessity for advanced methodologies to enhance their reliability. For instance, typical proprietary models still struggle with the perception of visually confusing images and are vulnerable to multimodal jailbreaking and adversarial attacks; MLLMs are more inclined to disclose privacy in text and reveal ideological and cultural biases even when paired with irrelevant images in inference, indicating that the multimodality amplifies the internal risks from base LLMs. Additionally, we release a scalable toolbox for standardized trustworthiness research, aiming to facilitate future advancements in this important field.

Poster,Multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Preference Human Feedback,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93434,"Lior Shani, Aviv Rosenberg, Asaf Cassel, Oran Lang, Daniele Calandriello, Avital Zipori, Hila Noga, Orgad Keller, Bilal Piot, Idan Szpektor, Avinatan Hassidim, Yossi Matias, Remi Munos","Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become the standard approach for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, allowing LLMs to demonstrate remarkable abilities in various tasks.  Existing methods work by emulating the human preference at the single decision (turn) level, limiting their capabilities in settings that require planning or multi-turn interactions to achieve a long-term goal. In this paper, we address this issue by developing novel methods for Reinforcement Learning (RL) from preference feedback between two full multi-turn conversations.  In the tabular setting, we present a novel mirror-descent-based policy optimization algorithm for the general multi-turn preference-based RL problem, and prove its convergence to Nash equilibrium.  To evaluate performance, we create a new environment, Education Dialogue, where a teacher agent  guides  a  student  in  learning  a  random  topic,  and  show  that  a  deep  RL variant of our algorithm outperforms RLHF baselines. Finally, we show that in an environment with explicit rewards, our algorithm recovers the same performance as a reward-based RL baseline, despite relying solely on a weaker preference signal."
Poster,Multivariate Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting with Correlated Errors,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94440,"Vincent Zhihao Zheng, Lijun Sun","Accurately modeling the correlation structure of errors is critical for reliable uncertainty quantification in probabilistic time series forecasting. While recent deep learning models for multivariate time series have developed efficient parameterizations for time-varying contemporaneous covariance, but they often assume temporal independence of errors for simplicity. However, real-world data often exhibit significant error autocorrelation and cross-lag correlation due to factors such as missing covariates. In this paper, we introduce a plug-and-play method that learns the covariance structure of errors over multiple steps for autoregressive models with Gaussian-distributed errors. To ensure scalable inference and computational efficiency, we model the contemporaneous covariance using a low-rank-plus-diagonal parameterization and capture cross-covariance through a group of independent latent temporal processes. The learned covariance matrix is then used to calibrate predictions based on observed residuals. We evaluate our method on probabilistic models built on RNNs and Transformer architectures, and the results confirm the effectiveness of our approach in improving predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification without significantly increasing the parameter size."
