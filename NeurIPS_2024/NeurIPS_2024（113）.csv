Poster,Distributional Reinforcement Learning with Regularized Wasserstein Loss,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96126,"Ke Sun, Yingnan Zhao, Wulong Liu, Bei Jiang, Linglong Kong","The empirical success of distributional reinforcement learning (RL) highly relies on the choice of distribution divergence equipped with an appropriate distribution representation. In this paper, we propose \textit{Sinkhorn distributional RL (SinkhornDRL)}, which leverages Sinkhorn divergence—a regularized Wasserstein loss—to minimize the difference between current and target Bellman return distributions. Theoretically, we prove the contraction properties of SinkhornDRL, aligning with the interpolation nature of Sinkhorn divergence between Wasserstein distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The introduced SinkhornDRL enriches the family of distributional RL algorithms, contributing to interpreting the algorithm behaviors compared with existing approaches by our investigation into their relationships. Empirically, we show that SinkhornDRL consistently outperforms or matches existing algorithms on the Atari games suite and particularly stands out in the multi-dimensional reward setting. \thanks{Code is available in \url{https://github.com/datake/SinkhornDistRL}.}."
Poster,Distributional Successor Features Enable Zero-Shot Policy Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96379,"Chuning Zhu, Xinqi Wang, Tyler Han, Simon Du, Abhishek Gupta","Intelligent agents must be generalists, capable of quickly adapting to various tasks. In reinforcement learning (RL), model-based RL learns a dynamics model of the world, in principle enabling transfer to arbitrary reward functions through planning. However, autoregressive model rollouts suffer from compounding error, making model-based RL ineffective for long-horizon problems. Successor features offer an alternative by modeling a policy's long-term state occupancy, reducing policy evaluation under new rewards to linear regression. Yet, policy optimization with successor features can be challenging. This work proposes a novel class of models, i.e., Distributional Successor Features for Zero-Shot Policy Optimization (DiSPOs), that learn a distribution of successor features of a stationary dataset's behavior policy, along with a policy that acts to realize different successor features within the dataset. By directly modeling long-term outcomes in the dataset, DiSPOs avoid compounding error while enabling a simple scheme for zero-shot policy optimization across reward functions. We present a practical instantiation of DiSPOs using diffusion models and show their efficacy as a new class of transferable models, both theoretically and empirically across various simulated robotics problems.

Poster,Distribution-Aware Data Expansion with Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94980,"Haowei Zhu, Ling Yang, Jun-Hai Yong, Hongzhi Yin, Jiawei Jiang, Meng Xiao, Wentao Zhang, Bin Wang","The scale and quality of a dataset significantly impact the performance of deep models. However, acquiring large-scale annotated datasets is both a costly and time-consuming endeavor. To address this challenge, dataset expansion technologies aim to automatically augment datasets, unlocking the full potential of deep models. Current data expansion techniques include image transformation and image synthesis methods. Transformation-based methods introduce only local variations, leading to limited diversity. In contrast, synthesis-based methods generate entirely new content, greatly enhancing informativeness. However, existing synthesis methods carry the risk of distribution deviations, potentially degrading model performance with out-of-distribution samples. In this paper, we propose DistDiff, a training-free data expansion framework based on the distribution-aware diffusion model. DistDiff constructs hierarchical prototypes to approximate the real data distribution, optimizing latent data points within diffusion models with hierarchical energy guidance. We demonstrate its capability to generate distribution-consistent samples, significantly improving data expansion tasks. DistDiff consistently enhances accuracy across a diverse range of datasets compared to models trained solely on original data. Furthermore, our approach consistently outperforms existing synthesis-based techniques and demonstrates compatibility with widely adopted transformation-based augmentation methods. Additionally, the expanded dataset exhibits robustness across various architectural frameworks."
Poster,Distribution Guidance Network for Weakly Supervised Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95702,"Zhiyi Pan, Wei Gao, Shan Liu, Ge Li","Despite alleviating the dependence on dense annotations inherent to fully supervised methods, weakly supervised point cloud semantic segmentation suffers from inadequate supervision signals. In response to this challenge, we introduce a novel perspective that imparts auxiliary constraints by regulating the feature space under weak supervision. Our initial investigation identifies which distributions accurately characterize the feature space, subsequently leveraging this priori to guide the alignment of the weakly supervised embeddings. Specifically, we analyze the superiority of the mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions (moVMF) among several common distribution candidates. Accordingly, we develop a Distribution Guidance Network (DGNet), which comprises a weakly supervised learning branch and a distribution alignment branch. Leveraging reliable clustering initialization derived from the weakly supervised learning branch, the distribution alignment branch alternately updates the parameters of the moVMF and the network, ensuring alignment with the moVMF-defined latent space. Extensive experiments validate the rationality and effectiveness of our distribution choice and network design. Consequently, DGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance under multiple datasets and various weakly supervised settings."
Poster,Distribution Learning with Valid Outputs Beyond the Worst-Case,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95620,"Nicholas Rittler, Kamalika Chaudhuri","Generative models at times produce ""invalid"" outputs, such as images with generation artifacts and unnatural sounds. Validity-constrained distribution learning attempts to address this problem by requiring that the learned distribution have a provably small fraction of its mass in invalid parts of space -- something which standard loss minimization does not always ensure. To this end, a learner in this model can guide the learning via ""validity queries"", which allow it to ascertain the validity of individual examples. Prior work on this problem takes a worst-case stance, showing that proper learning requires an exponential number of validity queries, and demonstrating an improper algorithm which -- while generating guarantees in a wide-range of settings -- makes a relatively large polynomial number of validity queries. In this work, we take a first step towards characterizing regimes where guaranteeing validity is easier than in the worst-case. We show that when the data distribution lies in the model class and the log-loss is minimized, the number samples required to ensure validity has a weak dependence on the validity requirement. Additionally, we show that when the validity region belongs to a VC-class, a limited number of validity queries are often sufficient."
Poster,DistrictNet: Decision-aware learning for geographical districting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93670,"Cheikh Ahmed, Alexandre Forel, Axel Parmentier, Thibaut Vidal","Districting is a complex combinatorial problem that consists in partitioning a geographical area into small districts. In logistics, it is a major strategic decision determining operating costs for several years. Solving districting problems using traditional methods is intractable even for small geographical areas and existing heuristics often provide sub-optimal results. We present a structured learning approach to find high-quality solutions to real-world districting problems in a few minutes. It is based on integrating a combinatorial optimization layer, the capacitated minimum spanning tree problem, into a graph neural network architecture. To train this pipeline in a decision-aware fashion, we show how to construct target solutions embedded in a suitable space and learn from target solutions. Experiments show that our approach outperforms existing methods as it can significantly reduce costs on real-world cities."
Poster,DiTFastAttn: Attention Compression for Diffusion Transformer Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96619,"Zhihang Yuan, Hanling Zhang, Lu Pu, Xuefei Ning, Linfeng Zhang, Tianchen Zhao, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Yu Wang","Diffusion Transformers (DiT) excel at image and video generation but face computational challenges due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention operators. We propose DiTFastAttn, a post-training compression method to alleviate the computational bottleneck of DiT.We identify three key redundancies in the attention computation during DiT inference: (1) spatial redundancy, where many attention heads focus on local information; (2) temporal redundancy, with high similarity between the attention outputs of neighboring steps; (3) conditional redundancy, where conditional and unconditional inferences exhibit significant similarity. We propose three techniques to reduce these redundancies: (1) $\textit{Window Attention with Residual Sharing}$ to reduce spatial redundancy; (2) $\textit{Attention Sharing across Timesteps}$ to exploit the similarity between steps; (3) $\textit{Attention Sharing across CFG}$ to skip redundant computations during conditional generation."
Poster,Divergences between Language Models and Human Brains,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96072,"Yuchen Zhou, Emmy Liu, Graham Neubig, Michael Tarr, Leila Wehbe","Do machines and humans process language in similar ways? Recent research has hinted at the affirmative, showing that human neural activity can be effectively predicted using the internal representations of language models (LMs). Although such results are thought to reflect shared computational principles between LMs and human brains, there are also clear differences in how LMs and humans represent and use language. In this work, we systematically explore the divergences between human and machine language processing by examining the differences between LM representations and human brain responses to language as measured by Magnetoencephalography (MEG) across two datasets in which subjects read and listened to narrative stories. Using an LLM-based data-driven approach, we identify two domains that LMs do not capture well: social/emotional intelligence and physical commonsense. We validate these findings with human behavioral experiments and hypothesize that the gap is due to insufficient representations of social/emotional and physical knowledge in LMs. Our results show that fine-tuning LMs on these domains can improve their alignment with human brain responses."
Poster,"Diversify, Contextualize, and Adapt: Efficient Entropy Modeling for Neural Image Codec",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94111,"Jun-Hyuk Kim, Seungeon Kim, Won-Hee Lee, Dokwan Oh","Designing a fast and effective entropy model is challenging but essential for practical application of neural codecs. Beyond spatial autoregressive entropy models, more efficient backward adaptation-based entropy models have been recently developed. They not only reduce decoding time by using smaller number of modeling steps but also maintain or even improve rate--distortion performance by leveraging more diverse contexts for backward adaptation. Despite their significant progress, we argue that their performance has been limited by the simple adoption of the design convention for forward adaptation: using only a single type of hyper latent representation, which does not provide sufficient contextual information, especially in the first modeling step. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective entropy modeling framework that leverages sufficient contexts for forward adaptation without compromising on bit-rate. Specifically, we introduce a strategy of diversifying hyper latent representations for forward adaptation, i.e., using two additional types of contexts along with the existing single type of context. In addition, we present a method to effectively use the diverse contexts for contextualizing the current elements to be encoded/decoded. By addressing the limitation of the previous approach, our proposed framework leads to significant performance improvements. Experimental results on popular datasets show that our proposed framework consistently improves rate-distortion performance across various bit-rate regions, e.g., 3.73\% BD-rate gain over the state-of-the-art baseline on the Kodak dataset."
Poster,Diversity-Driven Synthesis: Enhancing Dataset Distillation through Directed Weight Adjustment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93239,"JIAWEI DU, xin zhang, Juncheng Hu, Wenxin Huang, Joey Tianyi Zhou","The sharp increase in data-related expenses has motivated research into condensing datasets while retaining the most informative features. Dataset distillation has thus recently come to the fore. This paradigm generates synthetic datasets that are representative enough to replace the original dataset in training a neural network. To avoid redundancy in these synthetic datasets, it is crucial that each element contains unique features and remains diverse from others during the synthesis stage. In this paper, we provide a thorough theoretical and empirical analysis of diversity within synthesized datasets. We argue that enhancing diversity can improve the parallelizable yet isolated synthesizing approach. Specifically, we introduce a novel method that employs dynamic and directed weight adjustment techniques to modulate the synthesis process, thereby maximizing the representativeness and diversity of each synthetic instance. Our method ensures that each batch of synthetic data mirrors the characteristics of a large, varying subset of the original dataset. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, including CIFAR, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, demonstrate the superior performance of our method, highlighting its effectiveness in producing diverse and representative synthetic datasets with minimal computational expense.
