Poster,Towards Exact Gradient-based Training on Analog In-memory Computing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96597,"Zhaoxian Wu, Tayfun Gokmen, Malte Rasch, Tianyi Chen","Given the high economic and environmental costs of using large vision or language models, analog in-memory accelerators present a promising solution for energy-efficient AI. While inference on analog accelerators has been studied recently, the training perspective is underexplored. Recent studies have shown that the ""workhorse"" of digital AI training - stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm converges inexactly when applied to model training on non-ideal devices. This paper puts forth a theoretical foundation for gradient-based training on analog devices. We begin by characterizing the non-convergent issue of SGD, which is caused by the asymmetric updates on the analog devices. We then provide a lower bound of the asymptotic error to show that there is a fundamental performance limit of SGD-based analog training rather than an artifact of our analysis. To address this issue, we study a heuristic analog algorithm called Tiki-Taka that has recently exhibited superior empirical performance compared to SGD. We rigorously show its ability to converge to a critical point exactly and hence eliminate the asymptotic error. The simulations verify the correctness of the analyses."
Poster,Towards Explainable Evaluation Metrics for Machine Translation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/98304,"Christoph Leiter, Piyawat Lertvittayakumjorn, Marina Fomicheva, Wei Zhao, Yang Gao, Steffen Eger","Unlike classical lexical overlap metrics such as BLEU, most current evaluation metrics for machine translation (for example, COMET or BERTScore) are based on black-box large language models. They often achieve strong correlations with human judgments, but recent research indicates that the lower-quality classical metrics remain dominant, one of the potential reasons being that their decision processes are more transparent. To foster more widespread acceptance of novel high-quality metrics, explainability thus becomes crucial. In this concept paper, we identify key properties as well as key goals of explainable machine translation metrics and provide a comprehensive synthesis of recent techniques, relating them to our established goals and properties. In this context, we also discuss the latest state-of-the-art approaches to explainable metrics based on generative models such as ChatGPT and GPT4. Finally, we contribute a vision of next-generation approaches, including natural language explanations. We hope that our work can help catalyze and guide future research on explainable evaluation metrics and, mediately, also contribute to better and more transparent machine translation systems."
Poster,Towards Flexible 3D Perception: Object-Centric Occupancy Completion Augments 3D Object Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92996,"Chaoda Zheng, Feng Wang, Naiyan Wang, Shuguang Cui, Zhen Li","While 3D object bounding box (bbox) representation has been widely used in autonomous driving perception, it lacks the ability to capture the precise details of an object's intrinsic geometry. Recently, occupancy has emerged as a promising alternative for 3D scene perception. However, constructing a high-resolution occupancy map remains infeasible for large scenes due to computational constraints. Recognizing that foreground objects only occupy a small portion of the scene, we introduce object-centric occupancy as a supplement to object bboxes. This representation not only provides intricate details for detected objects but also enables higher voxel resolution in practical applications. We advance the development of object-centric occupancy perception from both data and algorithm perspectives. On the data side, we construct the first object-centric occupancy dataset from scratch using an automated pipeline. From the algorithmic standpoint, we introduce a novel object-centric occupancy completion network equipped with an implicit shape decoder that manages dynamic-size occupancy generation. This network accurately predicts the complete object-centric occupancy volume for inaccurate object proposals by leveraging temporal information from long sequences. Our method demonstrates robust performance in completing object shapes under noisy detection and tracking conditions. Additionally, we show that our occupancy features significantly enhance the detection results of state-of-the-art 3D object detectors, especially for incomplete or distant objects in the Waymo Open Dataset."
Poster,Towards Flexible Visual Relationship Segmentation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93908,"Fangrui Zhu, Jianwei Yang, Huaizu Jiang","Visual relationship understanding has been studied separately in human-object interaction(HOI) detection, scene graph generation(SGG),  and referring relationships(RR) tasks. Given the complexity and interconnectedness of these tasks, it is crucial to have a flexible framework that can effectively address these tasks in a cohesive manner.In this work, we propose FleVRS, a single model that seamlessly integrates the above three aspects in standard and promptable visual relationship segmentation, and further possesses the capability for open-vocabulary segmentation to adapt to novel scenarios. FleVRS leverages the synergy between text and image modalities, to ground various types of relationships from images and use textual features from vision-language models to visual conceptual understanding.Empirical validation across various datasets demonstrates that our framework outperforms existing models in standard, promptable, and open-vocabulary tasks, e.g., +1.9 $mAP$ on HICO-DET, +11.4 $Acc$ on VRD,  +4.7 $mAP$ on unseen HICO-DET.Our FleVRS represents a significant step towards a more intuitive, comprehensive, and scalable understanding of visual relationships."
Poster,Towards General Loop Invariant Generation: A Benchmark of Programs with Memory Manipulation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97660,"Chang Liu, Xiwei Wu, Yuan Feng, Qinxiang Cao, Junchi Yan","Program verification is vital for ensuring software reliability, especially in the context of increasingly complex systems. Loop invariants, remaining true before and after each iteration of loops, are crucial for this verification process. Traditional provers and machine learning based methods for generating loop invariants often require expert intervention or extensive labeled data, and typically only handle numerical property verification. These methods struggle with programs involving complex data structures and memory manipulations, limiting their applicability and automation capabilities. This paper introduces a new benchmark named LIG-MM, specifically for programs with complex data structures and memory manipulations. We collect 312 programs from various sources, including daily programs from college homework, the international competition (SV-COMP), benchmarks from previous papers (SLING), and programs from real-world software systems (Linux Kernel, GlibC, LiteOS, and Zephyr). Based on LIG-MM, our findings indicate that previous methods, including GPT-4, fail to automate verification for these programs. Consequently, we propose a novel LLM-SE framework that coordinates LLM with symbolic execution, fine-tuned using self-supervised learning, to generate loop invariants. Experimental results on LIG-MM demonstrate that our LLM-SE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a new direction toward automated program verification in real-world scenarios."
Poster,Towards Global Optimal Visual In-Context Learning Prompt Selection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95468,"Chengming Xu, Chen Liu, Yikai Wang, Yuan Yao, Yanwei Fu","Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) is a prevailing way to transfer visual foundation models to new tasks by leveraging contextual information contained in in-context examples to enhance learning and prediction of query sample. The fundamental problem in VICL is how to select the best prompt to activate its power as much as possible, which is equivalent to the ranking problem to test the in-context behavior of each candidate in the alternative set and select the best one. To utilize more appropriate ranking metric and leverage more comprehensive information among the alternative set, we propose a novel in-context example selection framework to approximately identify the global optimal prompt, i.e. choosing the best performing in-context examples from all alternatives for each query sample. Our method, dubbed Partial2Global, adopts a transformer-based list-wise ranker to provide a more comprehensive comparison within several alternatives, and a consistency-aware ranking aggregator to generate globally consistent ranking. The effectiveness of Partial2Global is validated through experiments on foreground segmentation, single object detection and image colorization, demonstrating that Partial2Global selects consistently better in-context examples compared with other methods, and thus establish the new state-of-the-arts."
Poster,Towards Harmless Rawlsian Fairness Regardless of Demographic Prior,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96448,"Xuanqian Wang, Jing Li, Ivor Tsang, Yew Soon Ong","Due to privacy and security concerns, recent advancements in group fairness advocate for model training regardless of demographic information. However, most methods still require prior knowledge of demographics. In this study, we explore the potential for achieving fairness without compromising its utility when no prior demographics are provided to the training set, namely _harmless Rawlsian fairness_. We ascertain that such a fairness requirement with no prior demographic information essential promotes training losses to exhibit a Dirac delta distribution. To this end, we propose a simple but effective method named VFair to minimize the variance of training losses inside the optimal set of empirical losses. This problem is then optimized by a tailored dynamic update approach that operates in both loss and gradient dimensions, directing the model towards relatively fairer solutions while preserving its intact utility. Our experimental findings indicate that regression tasks, which are relatively unexplored from literature, can achieve significant fairness improvement through VFair regardless of any prior, whereas classification tasks usually do not because of their quantized utility measurements. The implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/wxqpxw/VFair."
Poster,"Towards Heterogeneous Long-tailed Learning: Benchmarking, Metrics, and Toolbox",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97503,"Haohui Wang, Weijie Guan, Chen Jianpeng, Zi Wang, Dawei Zhou","Long-tailed data distributions pose challenges for a variety of domains like e-commerce, finance, biomedical science, and cyber security, where the performance of machine learning models is often dominated by head categories while tail categories are inadequately learned. This work aims to provide a systematic view of long-tailed learning with regard to three pivotal angles: (A1) the characterization of data long-tailedness, (A2) the data complexity of various domains, and (A3) the heterogeneity of emerging tasks. We develop HeroLT, a comprehensive long-tailed learning benchmark integrating 18 state-of-the-art algorithms, 10 evaluation metrics, and 17 real-world datasets across 6 tasks and 4 data modalities. HeroLT with novel angles and extensive experiments (315 in total) enables effective and fair evaluation of newly proposed methods compared with existing baselines on varying dataset types. Finally, we conclude by highlighting the significant applications of long-tailed learning and identifying several promising future directions. For accessibility and reproducibility, we open-source our benchmark HeroLT and corresponding results at https://github.com/SSSKJ/HeroLT."
Poster,Towards Human-AI Complementarity with Prediction Sets,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93055,"Giovanni De Toni, Nastaran Okati, Suhas Thejaswi, Eleni Straitouri, Manuel Rodriguez","Decision support systems based on prediction sets have proven to be effective at helping human experts solve classification tasks. Rather than providing single-label predictions, these systems provide sets of label predictions constructed using conformal prediction, namely prediction sets, and ask human experts to predict label values from these sets. In this paper, we first show that the prediction sets constructed using conformal prediction are, in general, suboptimal in terms of average accuracy. Then, we show that the problem of finding the optimal prediction sets under which the human experts achieve the highest average accuracy is NP-hard. More strongly, unless P = NP, we show that the problem is hard to approximate to any factor less than the size of the label set. However, we introduce a simple and efficient greedy algorithm that, for a large class of expert models and non-conformity scores, is guaranteed to find prediction sets that provably offer equal or greater performance than those constructed using conformal prediction. Further, using a simulation study with both synthetic and real expert predictions, we demonstrate that, in practice, our greedy algorithm finds near-optimal prediction sets offering greater performance than conformal prediction."
Poster,Towards Learning Group-Equivariant Features for Domain Adaptive 3D Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94710,"Sangyun Shin, Yuhang He, Madhu Vankadari, Ta-Ying Cheng, Qian Xie, Andrew Markham, Niki Trigoni","The performance of 3D object detection in large outdoor point clouds deteriorates significantly in an unseen environment due to the inter-domain gap. To address these challenges, most existing methods for domain adaptation harness self-training schemes and attempt to bridge the gap by focusing on a single factor that causes the inter-domain gap, such as objects' sizes, shapes, and foreground density variation. However, the resulting adaptations suggest that there is still a substantial inter-domain gap left to be minimized. We argue that this is due to two limitations: 1) Biased pseudo-label collection from self-training. 2) Multiple factors jointly contributing to how the object is perceived in the unseen target domain. In this work, we propose a grouping-exploration strategy framework,  Group Explorer Domain Adaptation ($\textbf{GroupEXP-DA}$), to addresses those two issues. Specifically, our grouping divides the available label sets into multiple clusters and ensures all of them have equal learning attention with the group-equivariant spatial feature, avoiding dominant types of objects causing imbalance problems. Moreover, grouping learns to divide objects by considering inherent factors in a data-driven manner, without considering each factor separately as existing works. On top of the group-equivariant spatial feature that selectively detects objects similar to the input group, we additionally introduce an explorative group update strategy that reduces the false negative detection in the target domain, further reducing the inter-domain gap. During inference, only the learned group features are necessary for making the group-equivariant spatial feature, placing our method as a simple add-on that can be applicable to most existing detectors. We show how each module contributes to substantially bridging the inter-domain gaps compared to existing works across large urban outdoor datasets such as NuScenes, Waymo, and KITTI."
