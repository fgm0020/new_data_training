Poster,Kernel PCA for Out-of-Distribution Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96025,"Kun Fang, Qinghua Tao, Kexin Lv, Mingzhen He, Xiaolin Huang, JIE YANG","Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection is vital for the reliability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).Existing works have shown the insufficiency of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) straightforwardly applied on the features of DNNs in detecting OoD data from In-Distribution (InD) data.The failure of PCA suggests that the network features residing in OoD and InD are not well separated by simply proceeding in a linear subspace, which instead can be resolved through proper non-linear mappings.In this work, we leverage the framework of Kernel PCA (KPCA) for OoD detection, and seek suitable non-linear kernels that advocate the separability between InD and OoD data in the subspace spanned by the principal components.Besides, explicit feature mappings induced from the devoted task-specific kernels are adopted so that the KPCA reconstruction error for new test samples can be efficiently obtained with large-scale data.Extensive theoretical and empirical results on multiple OoD data sets and network structures verify the superiority of our KPCA detector in  efficiency and efficacy with state-of-the-art detection performance."
Poster,Key-Grid: Unsupervised 3D Keypoints Detection using Grid Heatmap Features,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96634,"Chengkai Hou, Zhengrong Xue, Bingyang Zhou, Jinghan Ke, Lin Shao, Huazhe Xu","Detecting 3D keypoints with semantic consistency is widely used in many scenarios such as pose estimation, shape registration and robotics. Currently, most unsupervised 3D keypoint detection methods focus on the rigid-body objects. However, when faced with deformable objects, the keypoints they identify do not preserve semantic consistency well. In this paper, we introduce an innovative unsupervised keypoint detector Key-Grid for both the rigid-body and deformable objects, which is an autoencoder framework. The encoder predicts keypoints and the decoder utilizes the generated keypoints to reconstruct the objects. Unlike previous work, we leverage the identified keypoint in formation to form a 3D grid feature heatmap called grid heatmap, which is used in the decoder section. Grid heatmap is a novel concept that represents the latent variables for grid points sampled uniformly in the 3D cubic space, where these variables are the shortest distance between the grid points and the “skeleton” connected by keypoint pairs. Meanwhile, we incorporate the information from each layer of the encoder into the decoder section. We conduct an extensive evaluation of Key-Grid on a list of benchmark datasets. Key-Grid achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the semantic consistency and position accuracy of keypoints. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of Key-Grid to noise and downsampling. In addition, we achieve SE-(3) invariance of keypoints though generalizing Key-Grid to a SE(3)-invariant backbone."
Poster,KFNN: K-Free Nearest Neighbor For Crowdsourcing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93123,"Wenjun Zhang, Liangxiao Jiang, Chaoqun Li","To reduce annotation costs, it is common in crowdsourcing to collect only a few noisy labels from different crowd workers for each instance. However, the limited noisy labels restrict the performance of label integration algorithms in inferring the unknown true label for the instance. Recent works have shown that leveraging neighbor instances can help alleviate this problem. Yet, these works all assume that each instance has the same neighborhood size, which defies common sense. To address this gap, we propose a novel label integration algorithm called K-free nearest neighbor (KFNN). In KFNN, the neighborhood size of each instance is automatically determined based on its attributes and noisy labels. Specifically, KFNN initially estimates a Mahalanobis distance distribution from the attribute space to model the relationship between each instance and all classes. This distance distribution is then utilized to enhance the multiple noisy label distribution of each instance. Subsequently, a Kalman filter is designed to mitigate the impact of noise incurred by neighbor instances. Finally, KFNN determines the optimal neighborhood size by the max-margin learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that KFNN significantly outperforms all the other state-of-the-art algorithms and exhibits greater robustness in various crowdsourcing scenarios."
Poster,KG-FIT: Knowledge Graph Fine-Tuning Upon Open-World Knowledge,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93450,"Pengcheng Jiang, Lang Cao, Cao (Danica) Xiao, Parminder Bhatia, Jimeng Sun, Jiawei Han","Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) techniques are crucial in learning compact representations of entities and relations within a knowledge graph, facilitating efficient reasoning and knowledge discovery. While existing methods typically focus either on training KGE models solely based on graph structure or fine-tuning pre-trained language models with classification data in KG, KG-FIT leverages LLM-guided refinement to construct a semantically coherent hierarchical structure of entity clusters. By incorporating this hierarchical knowledge along with textual information during the fine-tuning process, KG-FIT effectively captures both global semantics from the LLM and local semantics from the KG. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets FB15K-237, YAGO3-10, and PrimeKG demonstrate the superiority of KG-FIT over state-of-the-art pre-trained language model-based methods, achieving improvements of 14.4\%, 13.5\%, and 11.9\% in the Hits@10 metric for the link prediction task, respectively. Furthermore, KG-FIT yields substantial performance gains of 12.6\%, 6.7\%, and 17.7\% compared to the structure-based base models upon which it is built. These results highlight the effectiveness of KG-FIT in incorporating open-world knowledge from LLMs to significantly enhance the expressiveness and informativeness of KG embeddings."
Poster,kGym: A Platform and Dataset to Benchmark Large Language Models on Linux Kernel Crash Resolution,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97426,"Alex Mathai, Chenxi Huang, Petros Maniatis, Aleksandr Nogikh, Franjo Ivančić, Junfeng Yang, Baishakhi Ray","Large Language Models (LLMs) are consistently improving at increasingly realistic software engineering (SE) tasks. In real-world software stacks, significant SE effort is spent developing foundational system software like the Linux kernel. Unlike application-level software, a systems codebase like Linux is multilingual (low-level C/Assembly/Bash/Rust); gigantic (>20 million lines); critical (impacting billions of devices worldwide), and highly concurrent (involving complex multi-threading). To evaluate if machine learning (ML) models are useful while developing such large-scale systems-level software, we introduce kGym (a platform) and kBench (a dataset). The kGym platform provides a SE environment for large-scale experiments on the Linux kernel, including compiling and running kernels in parallel across several virtual machines, detecting operations and crashes, inspecting logs, and querying and patching the code base. We use kGym to facilitate evaluation on kBench, a crash resolution benchmark drawn from real-world Linux kernel bugs.  An example bug in kBench contains crashing stack traces, a bug-reproducer file, a developer-written fix, and other associated data. To understand current performance, we conduct baseline experiments by prompting LLMs to resolve Linux kernel crashes. Our initial evaluations reveal that the best performing LLM achieves 0.72\% and 5.38\% in the unassisted and assisted (i.e., buggy files disclosed to the model) settings, respectively. These results highlight the need for further research to enhance model performance in SE tasks. Improving performance on kBench requires models to master new learning skills, including understanding the cause of crashes and repairing faults, writing memory-safe and hardware-aware code, and understanding concurrency. As a result, this work opens up multiple avenues of research at the intersection of machine learning and systems software."
Poster,KnowGPT: Knowledge Graph based Prompting for Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95299,"Qinggang Zhang, Junnan Dong, Hao Chen, Daochen Zha, Zailiang Yu, Xiao Huang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in many real-world applications. Nonetheless, LLMs are often criticized for their tendency to produce hallucinations, wherein the models fabricate incorrect statements on tasks beyond their knowledge and perception. To alleviate this issue, graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has been extensively explored which leverages the factual knowledge in knowledge graphs (KGs) to ground the LLM's responses in established facts and principles. However, most state-of-the-art LLMs are closed-source, making it challenging to develop a prompting framework that can efficiently and effectively integrate KGs into LLMs with hard prompts only. Generally, existing KG-enhanced LLMs usually suffer from three critical issues, including huge search space, high API costs, and laborious prompt engineering, that impede their widespread application in practice. To this end, we introduce a novel **Know**ledge **Gr**aph based **P**romp**T**ing framework, namely **KnowGPT**, to enhance LLMs with domain knowledge. KnowGPT contains a knowledge extraction module to extract the most informative knowledge from KGs, and a context-aware prompt construction module to automatically convert extracted knowledge into effective prompts. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that KnowGPT significantly outperforms all competitors. Notably, KnowGPT achieves a 92.6% accuracy on OpenbookQA leaderboard, comparable to human-level performance."
Poster,Knowledge Circuits in Pretrained Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94695,"Yunzhi Yao, Ningyu Zhang, Zekun Xi, Mengru Wang, Ziwen Xu, Shumin Deng, Huajun Chen","The remarkable capabilities of modern large language models are rooted in their vast repositories of knowledge encoded within their parameters, enabling them to perceive the world and engage in reasoning. The inner workings of how these models store knowledge have long been a subject of intense interest and investigation among researchers. To date, most studies have concentrated on isolated components within these models, such as the Multilayer Perceptrons and attention head. In this paper, we delve into the computation graph of the language model to uncover the knowledge circuits that are instrumental in articulating specific knowledge. The experiments, conducted with GPT2 and TinyLLAMA, has allowed us to observe how certain information heads, relation heads, and Multilayer Perceptrons collaboratively encode knowledge within the model. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of current knowledge editing techniques on these knowledge circuits, providing deeper insights into the functioning and constraints of these editing methodologies. Finally, we utilize knowledge circuits to analyze and interpret language model behaviors such as hallucinations and in-context learning. We believe the knowledge circuit holds potential for advancing our understanding of Transformers and guiding the improved design of knowledge editing."
Poster,Knowledge Composition using Task Vectors with Learned Anisotropic Scaling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95922,"Frederic Z. Zhang, Paul Albert, Cristian Rodriguez-Opazo, Anton van den Hengel, Ehsan Abbasnejad","Pre-trained models produce strong generic representations that can be adapted via fine-tuning on specialised datasets. The learned weight difference relative to the pre-trained model, known as a task vector, characterises the direction and stride of fine-tuning that enables the model to capture these specialised representations. The significance of task vectors is such that simple arithmetic operations on them can be used to combine diverse representations from different domains. This paper builds on these properties of task vectors and aims to answer (1) whether components of task vectors, particularly parameter blocks, exhibit similar characteristics, and (2) how such blocks can be used to enhance knowledge composition and transfer. To this end, we introduce aTLAS, an algorithm that linearly combines parameter blocks with different learned coefficients, resulting in anisotropic scaling at the task vector level. We show that such linear combinations explicitly exploit the low intrinsic dimensionality of pre-trained models, with only a few coefficients being the learnable parameters. Furthermore, composition of parameter blocks enables modular learning that effectively leverages the already learned representations, thereby reducing the dependency on large amounts of data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in task arithmetic, few-shot recognition and test-time adaptation, with supervised or unsupervised objectives. In particular, we show that (1) learned anisotropic scaling allows task vectors to be more disentangled, causing less interference in composition; (2) task vector composition excels with scarce or no labelled data and is less prone to domain shift, thus leading to better generalisability; (3) mixing the most informative parameter blocks across different task vectors prior to training can reduce the memory footprint and improve the flexibility of knowledge transfer. Moreover, we show the potential of aTLAS as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, particularly with less data, and demonstrate that it can be easily scaled up for higher performance."
Poster,Knowledge-Empowered Dynamic Graph Network for Irregularly Sampled Medical Time Series,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96299,"Yicheng Luo, Zhen Liu, Linghao Wang, Binquan Wu, Junhao Zheng, Qianli Ma","Irregularly Sampled Medical Time Series (ISMTS) are commonly found in the healthcare domain, where different variables exhibit unique temporal patterns while interrelated. However, many existing methods fail to efficiently consider the differences and correlations among medical variables together, leading to inadequate capture of fine-grained features at the variable level in ISMTS. We propose Knowledge-Empowered Dynamic Graph Network (KEDGN), a graph neural network empowered by variables' textual medical knowledge, aiming to model variable-specific temporal dependencies and inter-variable dependencies in ISMTS. Specifically, we leverage a pre-trained language model to extract semantic representations for each variable from their textual descriptions of medical properties, forming an overall semantic view among variables from a medical perspective. Based on this, we allocate variable-specific parameter spaces to capture variable-specific temporal patterns and generate a complete variable graph to measure medical correlations among variables. Additionally, we employ a density-aware mechanism to dynamically adjust the variable graph at different timestamps, adapting to the time-varying correlations among variables in ISMTS. The variable-specific parameter spaces and dynamic graphs are injected into the graph convolutional recurrent network to capture intra-variable and inter-variable dependencies in ISMTS together. Experiment results on four healthcare datasets demonstrate that KEDGN significantly outperforms existing methods."
Poster,Knowledge Graph Completion by Intermediate Variables Regularization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94366,"Changyi Xiao, Yixin Cao","Knowledge graph completion (KGC) can be framed as a 3-order binary tensor completion task. Tensor decomposition-based (TDB) models have demonstrated strong performance in KGC. In this paper, we provide a summary of existing TDB models and derive a general form for them, serving as a foundation for further exploration of TDB models. Despite the expressiveness of TDB models, they are prone to overfitting. Existing regularization methods merely minimize the norms of embeddings to regularize the model, leading to suboptimal performance. Therefore, we propose a novel regularization method for TDB models that addresses this limitation. The regularization is applicable to most TDB models and ensures tractable computation. Our method minimizes the norms of intermediate variables involved in the different ways of computing the predicted tensor. To support our regularization method, we provide a theoretical analysis that proves its effect in promoting low trace norm of the predicted tensor to reduce overfitting. Finally, we conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of our regularization technique as well as the reliability of our theoretical analysis.
