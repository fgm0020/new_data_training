Poster,APDDv2:  Aesthetics of Paintings and Drawings Dataset with Artist Labeled Scores and Comments,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97629,"Xin Jin, Qianqian Qiao, Yi Lu, HuayeWang, Heng Huang, Shan Gao, Jianfei Liu, Rui Li","Datasets play a pivotal role in training visual models, facilitating the development of abstract understandings of visual features through diverse image samples and multidimensional attributes. However, in the realm of aesthetic evaluation of artistic images, datasets remain relatively scarce. Existing painting datasets are often characterized by limited scoring dimensions and insufficient annotations, thereby constraining the advancement and application of automatic aesthetic evaluation methods in the domain of painting.To bridge this gap, we introduce the Aesthetics Paintings and Drawings Dataset (APDD), the first comprehensive collection of paintings encompassing 24 distinct  artistic categories and 10 aesthetic attributes. Building upon the initial release of APDDv1, our ongoing research has identified opportunities for enhancement in data scale and annotation precision. Consequently, APDDv2 boasts an expanded image corpus and improved annotation quality, featuring detailed language comments to better cater to the needs of both researchers and practitioners seeking high-quality painting datasets.Furthermore, we present an updated version of the Art Assessment Network for Specific Painting Styles, denoted as ArtCLIP. Experimental validation demonstrates the superior performance of this revised model in the realm of aesthetic evaluation, surpassing its predecessor in accuracy and efficacy.The dataset and model are available at https://github.com/BestiVictory/APDDv2.git."
Poster,APEBench: A Benchmark for Autoregressive Neural Emulators of PDEs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97550,"Felix Koehler, Simon Niedermayr, rüdiger westermann, Nils Thuerey","We introduce the **A**utoregressive **P**DE **E**mulator Benchmark (APEBench),  a comprehensive benchmark suite to evaluate autoregressive neural emulators for solving partial differential equations. APEBench is based on JAX and provides a seamlessly integrated differentiable simulation framework employing efficient pseudo-spectral methods, enabling 46 distinct PDEs across 1D, 2D, and 3D. Facilitating systematic analysis and comparison of learned emulators, we propose a novel taxonomy for unrolled training and introduce a unique identifier for PDE dynamics that directly relates to the stability criteria of classical numerical methods. APEBench enables the evaluation of diverse neural architectures, and unlike existing benchmarks, its tight integration of the solver enables support for differentiable physics training and neural-hybrid emulators. Moreover, APEBench emphasizes rollout metrics to understand temporal generalization, providing insights into the long-term behavior of emulating PDE dynamics. In several experiments, we highlight the similarities between neural emulators and numerical simulators. The code is available at [github.com/tum-pbs/apebench](https://github.com/tum-pbs/apebench) and APEBench can be installed via `pip install apebench`."
Poster,A Phase Transition between Positional and Semantic Learning in a Solvable Model of Dot-Product Attention,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96203,"Hugo Cui, Freya Behrens, Florent Krzakala, Lenka Zdeborová","Many empirical studies have provided evidence for the emergence of algorithmic mechanisms (abilities) in the learning of language models, that lead to qualitative improvements of the model capabilities. Yet, a theoretical characterization of how such mechanisms emerge remains elusive. In this paper, we take a step in this direction by providing a tight theoretical analysis of the emergence of semantic attention in a solvable model of dot-product attention. More precisely, we consider a non-linear self-attention layer with trainable tied and low-rank query and key matrices. In the asymptotic limit of high-dimensional data and a comparably large number of training samples we provide a tight closed-form characterization of the global minimum of the non-convex empirical loss landscape. We show that this minimum corresponds to either a positional attention mechanism (with tokens attending to each other based on their respective positions) or a semantic attention mechanism (with tokens attending to each other based on their meaning), and evidence an emergent phase transition from the former to the latter with increasing sample complexity. Finally, we compare the dot-product attention layer to a linear positional baseline, and show that it outperforms the latter using the semantic mechanism provided it has access to sufficient data."
Poster,A PID Controller Approach for Adaptive Probability-dependent Gradient Decay in Model Calibration,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94224,"Siyuan Zhang, Linbo Xie","Modern deep learning models often exhibit overconfident predictions, inadequately capturing uncertainty. During model optimization, the expected calibration error tends to overfit  earlier than classification accuracy, indicating distinct optimization objectives for classification error and calibration error. To ensure consistent optimization of both model accuracy and model calibration, we propose a novel method incorporating a probability-dependent gradient decay coefficient into loss function. This coefficient exhibits a strong correlation with the overall confidence level.  To maintain model calibration during optimization, we utilize a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller to dynamically adjust this gradient decay rate, where the adjustment relies on the proposed relative calibration error feedback in each epoch, thereby preventing the model from exhibiting over-confidence or under-confidence. Within the PID control system framework, the proposed relative calibration error serves as the control system output, providing an indication of the overall confidence level, while the gradient decay rate functions as the controlled variable. Moreover, recognizing the impact of gradient amplitude of adaptive decay rates, we implement an adaptive learning rate mechanism for gradient compensation to prevent inadequate learning of over-small or over-large gradient. Empirical experiments validate the efficacy of our PID-based adaptive gradient decay rate approach, ensuring consistent optimization of model calibration and model accuracy."
Poster,APIGen: Automated PIpeline for Generating Verifiable and Diverse Function-Calling Datasets,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97756,"Zuxin Liu, Thai Hoang, Jianguo Zhang, Ming Zhu, Tian Lan, Shirley kokane, Juntao Tan, Weiran Yao, Zhiwei Liu, Yihao Feng, Rithesh R N, Liangwei Yang, Silvio Savarese, Juan Carlos Niebles, Huan Wang, Shelby Heinecke, Caiming Xiong","The advancement of function-calling agent models requires diverse, reliable, and high-quality datasets. This paper presents APIGen, an automated data generation pipeline designed to synthesize high-quality datasets for function-calling applications. We leverage APIGen and collect 3,673 executable APIs across 21 different categories to generate diverse function-calling datasets in a scalable and structured manner. Each data in our dataset is verified through three hierarchical stages: format checking, actual function executions, and semantic verification, improving its reliability and correctness. We demonstrate that models trained with our curated datasets, even with only 7B parameters, can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Berkeley Function-Calling Benchmark, outperforming multiple GPT-4 models. Moreover, our 1B model achieves exceptional performance, surpassing GPT-3.5-Turbo and Claude-3 Haiku. We release a dataset containing 60,000 high-quality entries, aiming to advance the field of function-calling agent domains. The dataset and models are available on the project homepage \url{https://apigen-pipeline.github.io/}."
Poster,A Polar coordinate system represents syntax in large language models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93109,"Pablo J. Diego Simon, Stéphane d&#x27;Ascoli, Emmanuel Chemla, Yair Lakretz, Jean-Remi King","Originally formalized with symbolic representations, syntactic trees may also be effectively represented in the activations of large language models (LLMs). Indeed, a ''Structural Probe'' can find a subspace of neural activations, where syntactically-related words are relatively close to one-another. However, this syntactic code remains incomplete: the distance between the Structural Probe word embeddings can represent the \emph{existence} but not the type and direction of syntactic relations. Here, we hypothesize that syntactic relations are, in fact, coded by the relative direction between nearby embeddings. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a ''Polar Probe'' trained to read syntactic relations from both the distance and the direction between word embeddings. Our approach reveals three main findings. First, our Polar Probe successfully recovers the type and direction of syntactic relations, and substantially outperforms the Structural Probe by nearly two folds. Second, we confirm that this polar coordinate system exists in a low-dimensional subspace of the intermediate layers of many LLMs and becomes increasingly precise in the latest frontier models. Third, we demonstrate with a new benchmark that similar syntactic relations are coded similarly across the nested levels of syntactic trees. Overall, this work shows that LLMs spontaneously learn a geometry of neural activations that explicitly represents the main symbolic structures of linguistic theory."
Poster,Applying Guidance in a Limited Interval Improves Sample and Distribution Quality in Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93711,"Tuomas Kynkäänniemi, Miika Aittala, Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, Timo Aila, Jaakko Lehtinen","Guidance is a crucial technique for extracting the best performance out of image-generating diffusion models. Traditionally, a constant guidance weight has been applied throughout the sampling chain of an image. We show that guidance is clearly harmful toward the beginning of the chain (high noise levels), largely unnecessary toward the end (low noise levels), and only beneficial in the middle. We thus restrict it to a specific range of noise levels, improving both the inference speed and result quality. This limited guidance interval improves the record FID in ImageNet-512 significantly, from 1.81 to 1.40. We show that it is quantitatively and qualitatively beneficial across different sampler parameters, network architectures, and datasets, including the large-scale setting of Stable Diffusion XL. We thus suggest exposing the guidance interval as a hyperparameter in all diffusion models that use guidance."
Poster,Approaching Human-Level Forecasting with Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95949,"Danny Halawi, Fred Zhang, Chen Yueh-Han, Jacob Steinhardt","Forecasting future events is important for policy and decision making. In this work, we study whether language models (LMs) can forecast at the level of competitive human forecasters. Towards this goal, we develop a retrieval-augmented LM system designed to automatically search for relevant information, generate forecasts, and aggregate predictions. To facilitate our study, we collect a large dataset of questions from competitive forecasting platforms. Under a test set published after the knowledge cut-offs of our LMs, we evaluate the end-to-end performance of our system against the aggregates of human forecasts. On average, the system nears the crowd aggregate of competitive forecasters and, in a certain relaxed setting, surpasses it. Our work suggests that using LMs to forecasts the future could provide accurate predictions at scale and help to inform institutional decision making."
Poster,Approximated Orthogonal Projection Unit: Stabilizing Regression Network Training Using Natural Gradient,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93058,"Shaoqi Wang, Chunjie Yang, Siwei Lou","Neural networks (NN) are extensively studied in cutting-edge soft sensor models due to their  feature extraction and function approximation capabilities. Current research into network-based methods primarily focuses on models' offline accuracy. Notably, in industrial soft sensor context, online optimizing stability and interpretability are prioritized, followed by accuracy. This requires a clearer understanding of network's training process. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel NN named the Approximated Orthogonal Projection Unit (AOPU) which has solid mathematical basis and presents superior training stability. AOPU truncates the gradient backpropagation at dual parameters, optimizes the trackable parameters updates, and enhances the robustness of training. We further prove that AOPU attains minimum variance estimation in NN, wherein the truncated gradient approximates the natural gradient. Empirical results on two chemical process datasets clearly show that AOPU outperforms other models in achieving stable convergence, marking a significant advancement in soft sensor field."
Poster,Approximately Equivariant Neural Processes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94315,"Matthew Ashman, Cristiana Diaconu, Adrian Weller, Wessel Bruinsma, Richard Turner","Equivariant deep learning architectures exploit symmetries in learning problems to improve the sample efficiency of neural-network-based models and their ability to generalise. However, when modelling real-world data, learning problems are often not *exactly* equivariant, but only approximately. For example, when estimating the global temperature field from weather station observations, local topographical features like mountains break translation equivariance. In these scenarios, it is desirable to construct architectures that can flexibly depart from exact equivariance in a data-driven way. Current approaches to achieving this cannot usually be applied out-of-the-box to any architecture and symmetry group. In this paper, we develop a general approach to achieving this using existing equivariant architectures. Our approach is agnostic to both the choice of symmetry group and model architecture, making it widely applicable. We consider the use of approximately equivariant architectures in neural processes (NPs), a popular family of meta-learning models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a number of synthetic and real-world regression experiments, showing that approximately equivariant NP models can outperform both their non-equivariant and strictly equivariant counterparts."
