Poster,AutoSurvey: Large Language Models Can Automatically Write Surveys,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95990,"Yidong Wang, Qi Guo, Wenjin Yao, Hongbo Zhang, Xin Zhang, Zhen Wu, Meishan Zhang, Xinyu Dai, Min zhang, Qingsong Wen, Wei Ye, Shikun Zhang, Yue Zhang","This paper introduces AutoSurvey, a speedy and well-organized methodology for automating the creation of comprehensive literature surveys in rapidly evolving fields like artificial intelligence. Traditional survey paper creation faces challenges due to the vast volume and complexity of information, prompting the need for efficient survey methods. While large language models (LLMs) offer promise in automating this process, challenges such as context window limitations, parametric knowledge constraints, and the lack of evaluation benchmarks remain. AutoSurvey addresses these challenges through a systematic approach that involves initial retrieval and outline generation, subsection drafting by specialized LLMs, integration and refinement, and rigorous evaluation and iteration. Our contributions include a comprehensive solution to the survey problem, a reliable evaluation method, and experimental validation demonstrating AutoSurvey's effectiveness."
Poster,AutoTimes: Autoregressive Time Series Forecasters via Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95975,"Yong Liu, Guo Qin, Xiangdong Huang, Jianmin Wang, Mingsheng Long","Foundation models of time series have not been fully developed due to the limited availability of time series corpora and the underexploration of scalable pre-training. Based on the similar sequential formulation of time series and natural language, increasing research demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLM) for time series. Nevertheless, the inherent autoregressive property and decoder-only architecture of LLMs have not been fully considered, resulting in insufficient utilization of LLM abilities. To fully revitalize the general-purpose token transition and multi-step generation capability of large language models, we propose AutoTimes to repurpose LLMs as autoregressive time series forecasters, which projects time series into the embedding space of language tokens and autoregressively generates future predictions with arbitrary lengths. Compatible with any decoder-only LLMs, the consequent forecaster exhibits the flexibility of the lookback length and scalability with larger LLMs. Further, we formulate time series as prompts, extending the context for prediction beyond the lookback window, termed in-context forecasting. By introducing LLM-embedded textual timestamps, AutoTimes can utilize chronological information to align multivariate time series. Empirically, AutoTimes achieves state-of-the-art with 0.1% trainable parameters and over $5\times$ training/inference speedup compared to advanced LLM-based forecasters.

Poster,AvaTaR: Optimizing LLM Agents for Tool Usage via Contrastive Reasoning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95465,"Shirley Wu, Shiyu Zhao, Qian Huang, Kexin Huang, Michihiro Yasunaga, Kaidi Cao, Vassilis Ioannidis, Karthik Subbian, Jure Leskovec, James Zou","Large language model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in utilizing external tools and knowledge to boost accuracy and reduce hallucinations. However, developing prompting techniques that enable LLM agents to effectively use these tools and knowledge remains a heuristic and labor-intensive task. Here, we introduce AvaTaR, a novel and automated framework that optimizes an LLM agent to effectively leverage provided tools, improving performance on a given task. During optimization, we design a comparator module to iteratively deliver insightful and comprehensive prompts to the LLM agent by contrastively reasoning between positive and negative examples sampled from training data. We demon- strate AvaTaR on four complex multimodal retrieval datasets featuring textual, visual, and relational information, and three general question-answering (QA) datasets. We find AvaTaR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all seven tasks, exhibiting strong generalization ability when applied to novel cases and achieving an average relative improvement of 14% on the Hit@1 metric for the retrieval datasets and 13% for the QA datasets.

Poster,AV-Cloud: Spatial Audio Rendering Through Audio-Visual Cloud Splatting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92984,"Mingfei Chen, Eli Shlizerman","We propose a novel approach for rendering high-quality spatial audio for 3D scenes that is in synchrony with the visual stream but does not rely or explicitly conditioned on the visual rendering. We demonstrate that such an approach enables the experience of immersive virtual tourism - performing a real-time dynamic navigation within the scene, experiencing both audio and visual content. Current audio-visual rendering approaches typically rely on visual cues, such as images, and thus visual artifacts could cause inconsistency in the audio quality. Furthermore, when such approaches are incorporated with visual rendering, audio generation at each viewpoint occurs after the rendering of the image of the viewpoint and thus could lead to audio lag that affects the integration of audio and visual streams. Our proposed approach, AV-Cloud, overcomes these challenges by learning the representation of the audio-visual scene based on a set of sparse AV anchor points, that constitute the Audio-Visual Cloud, and are derived from the camera calibration. The Audio-Visual Cloud serves as an audio-visual representation from which the generation of spatial audio for arbitrary listener location can be generated. In particular, we propose a novel module Audio-Visual Cloud Splatting which decodes AV anchor points into a spatial audio transfer function for the arbitrary viewpoint of the target listener. This function, applied through the Spatial Audio Render Head module, transforms monaural input into viewpoint-specific spatial audio. As a result, AV-Cloud efficiently renders the spatial audio aligned with any visual viewpoint and eliminates the need for pre-rendered images. We show that AV-Cloud surpasses current state-of-the-art accuracy on audio reconstruction, perceptive quality, and acoustic effects on two real-world datasets. AV-Cloud also outperforms previous methods when tested on scenes ""in the wild""."
Poster,Average gradient outer product as a mechanism for deep neural collapse,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93185,"Daniel Beaglehole, Peter Súkeník, Marco Mondelli, Misha Belkin","Deep Neural Collapse (DNC) refers to the surprisingly rigid structure of the data representations in the final layers of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Though the phenomenon has been measured in a variety of settings, its emergence is typically explained via data-agnostic approaches, such as the unconstrained features model. In this work, we introduce a data-dependent setting where DNC forms due to feature learning through the average gradient outer product (AGOP). The AGOP is defined with respect to a learned predictor and is equal to the uncentered covariance matrix of its input-output gradients averaged over the training dataset. Deep Recursive Feature Machines are a method that constructs a neural network by iteratively mapping the data with the AGOP and applying an untrained random feature map. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that DNC occurs in Deep Recursive Feature Machines as a consequence of the projection with the AGOP matrix computed at each layer. We then provide evidence that this mechanism holds for neural networks more generally. We show that the right singular vectors and values of the weights can be responsible for the majority of within-class variability collapse for DNNs trained in the feature learning regime. As observed in recent work, this singular structure is highly correlated with that of the AGOP."
Poster,AverNet: All-in-one Video Restoration for Time-varying Unknown Degradations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94957,"Haiyu Zhao, Lei Tian, Xinyan Xiao, Peng Hu, Yuanbiao Gou, Xi Peng","Traditional video restoration approaches were designed to recover clean videos from a specific type of degradation, making them ineffective in handling multiple unknown types of degradation. To address this issue, several studies have been conducted and have shown promising results. However, these studies overlook that the degradations in video usually change over time, dubbed time-varying unknown degradations (TUD). To tackle such a less-touched challenge, we propose an innovative method, termed as All-in-one VidEo Restoration Network (AverNet), which comprises two core modules, i.e., Prompt-Guided Alignment (PGA) module and Prompt-Conditioned Enhancement (PCE) module. Specifically, PGA addresses the issue of pixel shifts caused by time-varying degradations by learning and utilizing prompts to align video frames at the pixel level. To handle multiple unknown degradations, PCE recasts it into a conditional restoration problem by implicitly establishing a conditional map between degradations and ground truths. Thanks to the collaboration between PGA and PCE modules, AverNet empirically demonstrates its effectiveness in recovering videos from TUD. Extensive experiments are carried out on two synthesized datasets featuring seven types of degradations with random corruption levels. The code is available at https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/2024-NeurIPS-AverNet."
Poster,A Versatile Diffusion Transformer with Mixture of Noise Levels for Audiovisual Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94376,"Gwanghyun Kim, Alonso Martinez, Yu-Chuan Su, Brendan Jou, Jose Lezama, Agrim Gupta, Lijun Yu, Lu Jiang, Aren Jansen, Jacob Walker, Krishna Somandepalli","Training diffusion models for audiovisual sequences allows for a range of generation tasks by learning conditional distributions of various input-output combinations of the two modalities. Nevertheless, this strategy often requires training a separate model for each task which is expensive. Here, we propose a novel training approach to effectively learn arbitrary conditional distributions in the audiovisual space. Our key contribution lies in how we parameterize the diffusion timestep in the forward diffusion process. Instead of the standard fixed diffusion timestep, we propose applying variable diffusion timesteps across the temporal dimension and across modalities of the inputs. This formulation offers flexibility to introduce variable noise levels for various portions of the input, hence the term mixture of noise levels. We propose a transformer-based audiovisual latent diffusion model and show that it can be trained in a task-agnostic fashion using our approach to enable a variety of audiovisual generation tasks at inference time. Experiments demonstrate the versatility of our method in tackling cross-modal and multimodal interpolation tasks in the audiovisual space. Notably, our proposed approach surpasses baselines in generating temporally and perceptually consistent samples conditioned on the input. Project page: neurips13025.github.io"
Poster,A versatile informative diffusion model for single-cell ATAC-seq data generation and analysis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95129,"Lei Huang, Lei Xiong, Na Sun, Zunpeng Liu, Ka-Chun Wong, Manolis Kellis","The rapid advancement of single-cell ATAC sequencing (scATAC-seq) technologies holds great promise for investigating the heterogeneity of epigenetic landscapes at the cellular level. The amplification process in scATAC-seq experiments often introduces noise due to dropout events, which results in extreme sparsity that hinders accurate analysis. Consequently, there is a significant demand for the generation of high-quality scATAC-seq data in silico. Furthermore, current methodologies are typically task-specific, lacking a versatile framework capable of handling multiple tasks within a single model. In this work, we propose ATAC-Diff, a versatile framework, which is based on a diffusion model conditioned on the latent auxiliary variables to adapt for various tasks. ATAC-Diff is the first diffusion model for the scATAC-seq data generation and analysis, composed of auxiliary modules encoding the latent high-level variables to enable the model to learn the semantic information to sample high-quality data. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as the latent prior and auxiliary decoder, the yield variables reserve the refined genomic information beneficial for downstream analyses. Another innovation is the incorporation of mutual information between observed and hidden variables as a regularization term to prevent the model from decoupling from latent variables. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ATAC-Diff achieves high performance in both generation and analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art models."
Poster,AV-GS: Learning Material and Geometry Aware Priors for Novel View Acoustic Synthesis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96666,"Swapnil Bhosale, Haosen Yang, Diptesh Kanojia, Jiankang Deng, Xiatian Zhu","Novel view acoustic synthesis (NVAS) aims to render binaural audio at any target viewpoint, given a mono audio emitted by a sound source at a 3D scene. Existing methods have proposed NeRF-based implicit models to exploit visual cues as a condition for synthesizing binaural audio. However, in addition to low efficiency originating from heavy NeRF rendering, these methods all have a limited ability of characterizing the entire scene environment such as room geometry, material properties, and the spatial relation between the listener and sound source. To address these issues, we propose a novel Audio-Visual Gaussian Splatting (AV-GS) model. To obtain a material-aware and geometry-aware condition for audio synthesis, we learn an explicit point-based scene representation with audio-guidance parameters on locally initialized Gaussian points, taking into account the space relation from the listener and sound source. To make the visual scene model audio adaptive, we propose a point densification and pruning strategy to optimally distribute the Gaussian points, with the per-point contribution in sound propagation (e.g., more points needed for texture-less wall surfaces as they affect sound path diversion). Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our AV-GS over existing alternatives on the real-world RWAS and simulation-based SoundSpaces datasets.

Poster,Avoiding Undesired Future with Minimal Cost in Non-Stationary Environments,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93000,"Wen-Bo Du, Tian Qin, Tian-Zuo Wang, Zhi-Hua Zhou","Machine learning (ML) has achieved remarkable success in prediction tasks. In many real-world scenarios, rather than solely predicting an outcome using an ML model, the crucial concern is how to make decisions to prevent the occurrence of undesired outcomes, known as the *avoiding undesired future (AUF)* problem. To this end, a new framework called *rehearsal learning* has been proposed recently, which works effectively in stationary environments by leveraging the influence relations among variables. In real tasks, however, the environments are usually non-stationary, where the influence relations may be *dynamic*, leading to the failure of AUF by the existing method. In this paper, we introduce a novel sequential methodology that effectively updates the estimates of dynamic influence relations, which are crucial for rehearsal learning to prevent undesired outcomes in non-stationary environments. Meanwhile, we take the cost of decision actions into account and provide the formulation of AUF problem with minimal action cost under non-stationarity. We prove that in linear Gaussian cases, the problem can be transformed into the well-studied convex quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). In this way, we establish the first polynomial-time rehearsal-based approach for addressing the AUF problem. Theoretical and experimental results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method under certain circumstances."
