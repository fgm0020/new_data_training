Poster,OmniTokenizer: A Joint Image-Video Tokenizer for Visual Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95856,"Junke Wang, Yi Jiang, Zehuan Yuan, BINGYUE PENG, Zuxuan Wu, Yu-Gang Jiang","Tokenizer, serving as a translator to map the intricate visual data into a compact latent space, lies at the core of visual generative models. Based on the finding that existing tokenizers are tailored to either image or video inputs, this paper presents OmniTokenizer, a transformer-based tokenizer for joint image and video tokenization. OmniTokenizer is designed with a spatial-temporal decoupled architecture, which integrates window attention and causal attention for spatial and temporal modeling, respectively. To exploit the complementary nature of image and video data, we further propose a progressive training strategy, where OmniTokenizer is first trained on image data on a fixed resolution to develop the spatial encoding capacity and then jointly trained on image and video data on multiple resolutions to learn the temporal dynamics. OmniTokenizer, for the first time, handles both image and video inputs within a unified framework and proves the possibility of realizing their synergy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniTokenizer achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction performance on various image and video datasets, e.g., 1.11 reconstruction FID on ImageNet and 42 reconstruction FVD on UCF-101, beating the previous SOTA methods by 13% and 26%, respectively. Additionally, we also show that when integrated with OmniTokenizer, both language model-based approaches and diffusion models can realize advanced visual synthesis performance, underscoring the superiority and versatility of our method."
Poster,On $f$-Divergence Principled Domain Adaptation: An Improved Framework,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93084,"Ziqiao Wang, Yongyi Mao","Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) plays a crucial role in addressing distribution shifts in machine learning. In this work, we improve the theoretical foundations of UDA proposed in Acuna et al. (2021) by refining their $f$-divergence-based discrepancy and additionally introducing a new measure, $f$-domain discrepancy ($f$-DD). By removing the absolute value function and incorporating a scaling parameter, $f$-DD obtains novel target error and sample complexity bounds, allowing us to recover previous KL-based results and bridging the gap between algorithms and theory presented in Acuna et al. (2021). Using a localization technique, we also develop a fast-rate generalization bound. Empirical results demonstrate the superior performance of $f$-DD-based learning algorithms over previous works in popular UDA benchmarks."
Poster,On Affine Homotopy between Language Encoders,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95971,"Robin Chan, Reda Boumasmoud, Anej Svete, Yuxin Ren, Qipeng Guo, Zhijing Jin, Shauli Ravfogel, Mrinmaya Sachan, Bernhard Schölkopf, Mennatallah El-Assady, Ryan Cotterell","Pre-trained language encoders---functions that represent text as vectors---are an integral component of many NLP tasks.    We tackle a natural question in language encoder analysis: What does it mean for two encoders to be similar?    We contend that a faithful measure of similarity needs to be \emph{intrinsic}, that is, task-independent, yet still be informative of \emph{extrinsic} similarity---the performance on downstream tasks.    It is common to consider two encoders similar if they are \emph{homotopic}, i.e., if they can be aligned through some transformation.    In this spirit, we study the properties of \emph{affine} alignment of language encoders and its implications on extrinsic similarity.    We find that while affine alignment is fundamentally an asymmetric notion of similarity, it is still informative of extrinsic similarity.    We confirm this on datasets of natural language representations.    Beyond providing useful bounds on extrinsic similarity, affine intrinsic similarity also allows us to begin uncovering the structure of the space of pre-trained encoders by defining an order over them."
Poster,On Causal Discovery in the Presence of Deterministic Relations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93539,"Loka Li, Haoyue Dai, Hanin Al Ghothani, Biwei Huang, Jiji Zhang, Shahar Harel, Isaac Bentwich, Guangyi Chen, Kun Zhang","Many causal discovery methods typically rely on the assumption of independent noise, yet real-life situations often involve deterministic relationships. In these cases, observed variables are represented as deterministic functions of their parental variables without noise.When determinism is present, constraint-based methods encounter challenges due to the violation of the faithfulness assumption. In this paper, we find, supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, that score-based methods with exact search can naturally address the issues of deterministic relations under rather mild assumptions. Nonetheless, exact score-based methods can be computationally expensive. To enhance the efficiency and scalability, we develop a novel framework for causal discovery that can detect and handle deterministic relations, called Determinism-aware Greedy Equivalent Search (DGES). DGES comprises three phases: (1) identify minimal deterministic clusters (i.e., a minimal set of variables with deterministic relationships), (2) run modified Greedy Equivalent Search (GES) to obtain an initial graph, and (3) perform exact search exclusively on the deterministic cluster and its neighbors. The proposed DGES accommodates both linear and nonlinear causal relationships, as well as both continuous and discrete data types. Furthermore, we investigate the identifiability conditions of DGES. We conducted extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets to show the efficacy of our proposed method."
Poster,Once Read is Enough: Domain-specific Pretraining-free Language Models with Cluster-guided Sparse Experts for Long-tail Domain Knowledge,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93747,"Fang Dong, Mengyi Chen, Jixian Zhou, Yubin Shi, Yixuan Chen, Mingzhi Dong, Yujiang Wang, Dongsheng Li, Xiaochen Yang, Rui Zhu, Robert Dick, Qin Lv, Fan Yang, Tun Lu, Ning Gu, Li Shang","Language models (LMs) only pretrained on a general and massive corpus usually cannot attain satisfying performance on domain-specific downstream tasks, and hence, applying domain-specific pretraining to LMs is a common and indispensable practice.However, domain-specific pretraining can be costly and time-consuming, hindering LMs' deployment in real-world applications.In this work, we consider the incapability to memorize domain-specific knowledge embedded in the general corpus with rare occurrences and long-tail distributions as the leading cause for pretrained LMs' inferior downstream performance. Analysis of Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) reveals that those long-tail data are commonly overlooked in the model's gradient updates and, consequently, are not effectively memorized, leading to poor domain-specific downstream performance.Based on the intuition that data with similar semantic meaning are closer in the embedding space, we devise a Cluster-guided Sparse Expert (CSE) layer to actively learn long-tail domain knowledge typically neglected in previous pretrained LMs.During pretraining, a CSE layer efficiently clusters domain knowledge together and assigns long-tail knowledge to designate extra experts. CSE is also a lightweight structure that only needs to be incorporated in several deep layers.With our training strategy, we found that during pretraining, data of long-tail knowledge gradually formulate isolated, outlier clusters in an LM's representation spaces, especially in deeper layers. Our experimental results show that only pretraining CSE-based LMs is enough to achieve superior performance than regularly pretrained-finetuned LMs on various downstream tasks, implying the prospects of domain-specific-pretraining-free language models."
Poster,On conditional diffusion models for PDE simulations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93694,"Aliaksandra Shysheya, Cristiana Diaconu, Federico Bergamin, Paris Perdikaris, José Miguel Hernández-Lobato, Richard Turner, Emile Mathieu","Modelling partial differential equations (PDEs) is of crucial importance in science and engineering, and it includes tasks ranging from forecasting to inverse problems, such as data assimilation. However, most previous numerical and machine learning approaches that target forecasting cannot be applied out-of-the-box for data assimilation. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for conditional generation, being able to flexibly incorporate observations without retraining. In this work, we perform a comparative study of score-based diffusion models for forecasting and assimilation of sparse observations.  In particular, we focus on diffusion models that are either trained in a conditional manner, or conditioned after unconditional training. We address the shortcomings of existing models by proposing 1) an autoregressive sampling approach, that significantly improves performance in forecasting, 2) a new training strategy for conditional score-based models that achieves stable performance over a range of history lengths, and 3) a hybrid model which employs flexible pre-training conditioning on initial conditions and flexible post-training conditioning to handle data assimilation. We empirically show that these modifications are crucial for successfully tackling the combination of forecasting and data assimilation, a task commonly encountered in real-world scenarios."
Poster,On Convergence of Adam for Stochastic Optimization under Relaxed Assumptions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93100,"Yusu Hong, Junhong Lin","In this paper, we study Adam in non-convex smooth scenarios with potential unbounded gradients and affine variance noise. We consider a general noise model which governs affine variance noise, bounded noise, and sub-Gaussian noise. We show that Adam with a specific hyper-parameter setup can find a stationary point with a $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(\log T)/\sqrt{T})$ rate in high probability under this general noise model where $T$ denotes total number iterations, matching the lower rate of stochastic first-order algorithms up to logarithm factors. We also provide a probabilistic convergence result for Adam under a generalized smooth condition which allows unbounded smoothness parameters and has been illustrated empirically to capture the smooth property of many practical objective functions more accurately."
Poster,On Differentially Private Subspace Estimation in a Distribution-Free Setting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94575,Eliad Tsfadia,"Private data analysis faces a significant challenge known as the curse of dimensionality, leading to increased costs. However, many datasets possess an inherent low-dimensional structure. For instance, during optimization via gradient descent, the gradients frequently reside near a low-dimensional subspace. If the low-dimensional structure could be privately identified using a small amount of points, we could avoid paying for the high ambient dimension.On the negative side, Dwork, Talwar, Thakurta, and Zhang (STOC 2014) proved that privately estimating subspaces, in general, requires an amount of points that has a polynomial dependency on the dimension. However, their bounds do not rule out the possibility to reduce the number of points for ""easy"" instances. Yet, providing a measure that captures how much a given dataset is ""easy"" for this task turns out to be challenging, and was not properly addressed in prior works.Inspired by the work of Singhal and Steinke (NeurIPS 2021), we provide the first measures that quantify ""easiness"" as a function of multiplicative singular-value gaps in the input dataset, and support them with new upper and lower bounds. In particular, our results determine the first types of gaps that are sufficient and necessary for estimating a subspace with an amount of points that is independent of the dimension. Furthermore, we realize our upper bounds using a practical algorithm and demonstrate its advantage in high-dimensional regimes compared to prior approaches."
Poster,On Differentially Private U Statistics,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92970,"Kamalika Chaudhuri, Po-Ling Loh, Shourya Pandey, Purnamrita Sarkar","We consider the problem of privately estimating a parameter $\mathbb{E}[h(X_1,\dots,X_k)]$, where $X_1$, $X_2$, $\dots$, $X_k$ are i.i.d. data from some distribution and $h$ is a permutation-invariant function. Without privacy constraints, the standard estimators for this task are U-statistics, which commonly arise in a wide range of problems, including nonparametric signed rank tests, symmetry testing, uniformity testing, and subgraph counts in random networks, and are the unique minimum variance unbiased estimators under mild conditions. Despite the recent outpouring of interest in private mean estimation, privatizing U-statistics has received little attention. While existing private mean estimation algorithms can be applied in a black-box manner to obtain confidence intervals, we show that they can lead to suboptimal private error, e.g., constant-factor inflation in the leading term, or even $\Theta(1/n)$ rather than $O(1/n^2)$ in degenerate settings. To remedy this, we propose a new thresholding-based approach that reweights different subsets of the data using _local Hájek projections_. This leads to nearly optimal private error for non-degenerate U-statistics and a strong indication of near-optimality for degenerate U-statistics."
Poster,On Divergence Measures for Training GFlowNets,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95464,"Tiago Silva, Eliezer de Souza da Silva, Diego Mesquita","Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are amortized samplers of unnormalized distributions over compositional objects with applications to causal discovery, NLP, and drug design. Recently, it was shown that GFlowNets can be framed as a hierarchical variational inference (HVI) method for discrete distributions. Despite this equivalence, attempts to train GFlowNets using traditional divergence measures as learning objectives were unsuccessful. Instead, current approaches for training these models rely on minimizing the log-squared difference between a proposal (forward policy) and a target (backward policy) distributions. In this work, we first formally extend the relationship between GFlowNets and HVI to distributions on arbitrary measurable topological spaces. Then, we empirically show that the ineffectiveness of divergence-based learning of GFlowNets is due to large gradient variance of the corresponding stochastic objectives. To address this issue, we devise a collection of provably variance-reducing control variates for gradient estimation based on the REINFORCE leave-one-out estimator. Our experimental results suggest that the resulting algorithms often accelerate training convergence when compared against previous approaches. All in all, our work contributes by narrowing the gap between GFlowNet training and HVI, paving the way for algorithmic advancements inspired by the divergence minimization viewpoint."
