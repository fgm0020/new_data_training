Poster,Copycats: the many lives of a publicly available medical imaging dataset,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97652,"Amelia Jiménez-Sánchez, Natalia-Rozalia Avlona, Dovile Juodelyte, Théo Sourget, Caroline Vang-Larsen, Anna Rogers, Hubert Zając, Veronika Cheplygina","Medical Imaging (MI) datasets are fundamental to artificial intelligence in healthcare. The accuracy, robustness, and fairness of diagnostic algorithms depend on the data (and its quality) used to train and evaluate the models. MI datasets used to be proprietary, but have become increasingly available to the public, including on community-contributed platforms (CCPs) like Kaggle or HuggingFace. While open data is important to enhance the redistribution of data's public value, we find that the current CCP governance model fails to uphold the quality needed and recommended practices for sharing, documenting, and evaluating datasets. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of publicly available machine learning datasets on CCPs, discussing datasets' context, and identifying limitations and gaps in the current CCP landscape. We highlight differences between MI and computer vision datasets, particularly in the potentially harmful downstream effects from poor adoption of recommended dataset management practices. We compare the analyzed datasets across several dimensions, including data sharing, data documentation, and maintenance. We find vague licenses, lack of persistent identifiers and storage, duplicates, and missing metadata, with differences between the platforms. Our research contributes to efforts in responsible data curation and AI algorithms for healthcare."
Poster,CorDA: Context-Oriented Decomposition Adaptation of Large Language Models for Task-Aware Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95886,"Yibo Yang, Xiaojie Li, Zhongzhu Zhou, Shuaiwen Song, Jianlong Wu, Liqiang Nie, Bernard Ghanem","Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods build adapters widely agnostic of the context of downstream task to learn, or the context of important knowledge to maintain. As a result, there is often a performance gap compared to full-parameter fine-tuning, and meanwhile the fine-tuned model suffers from catastrophic forgetting of the pre-trained world knowledge. In this paper, we propose **CorDA**, a Context-oriented Decomposition Adaptation method that builds learnable **task-aware adapters** from weight decomposition oriented by the context of downstream task or the world knowledge to maintain. Concretely, we collect a few data samples, and perform singular value decomposition for each linear layer of a pre-trained LLM multiplied by the covariance matrix of the input activation using these samples. The inverse of the covariance matrix is multiplied with the decomposed components to reconstruct the original weights. By doing so, the context of the representative samples is captured through deciding the factorizing orientation. Our method enables two options, the **knowledge-preserved adaptation** and the **instruction-previewed adaptation**. For the former, we use question-answering samples to obtain the covariance matrices, and use the decomposed components with the smallest $r$ singular values to initialize a learnable adapter, with the others frozen such that the world knowledge is better preserved. For the latter, we use the instruction data from the fine-tuning task, such as math or coding, to orientate the decomposition and train the largest $r$ components that most correspond to the task to learn. We conduct extensive experiments on Math, Code, and Instruction Following tasks. Our knowledge-preserved adaptation not only achieves better performance than LoRA on fine-tuning tasks, but also mitigates the forgetting of world knowledge. Our instruction-previewed adaptation is able to further enhance the fine-tuning performance to be comparable with full fine-tuning, surpassing the state-of-the-art PEFT methods such as LoRA, DoRA, and PiSSA."
Poster,Corruption-Robust Linear Bandits: Minimax Optimality and Gap-Dependent Misspecification,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93118,"Haolin Liu, Artin Tajdini, Andrew Wagenmaker, Chen-Yu Wei","In linear bandits, how can a learner effectively learn when facing corrupted rewards? While significant work has explored this question, a holistic understanding across different adversarial models and corruption measures is lacking, as is a full characterization of the minimax regret bounds. In this work, we compare two types of corruptions commonly considered: strong corruption, where the corruption level depends on the learner’s chosen action, and weak corruption, where the corruption level does not depend on the learner’s chosen action. We provide a unified framework to analyze these corruptions. For stochastic linear bandits, we fully characterize the gap between the minimax regret under strong and weak corruptions. We also initiate the study of corrupted adversarial linear bandits, obtaining upper and lower bounds with matching dependencies on the corruption level. Next, we reveal a connection between corruption-robust learning and learning with gap-dependent misspecification—a setting first studied by Liu et al. (2023a), where the misspecification level of an action or policy is proportional to its suboptimality. We present a general reduction that enables any corruption-robust algorithm to handle gap-dependent misspecification. This allows us to recover the results of Liu et al. (2023a) in a black-box manner and significantly generalize them to settings like linear MDPs, yielding the first results for gap-dependent misspecification in reinforcement learning. However, this general reduction does not attain the optimal rate for gap-dependent misspecification. Motivated by this, we develop a specialized algorithm that achieves optimal bounds for gap-dependent misspecification in linear bandits, thus answering an open question posed by Liu et al. (2023a)."
Poster,CosAE: Learnable Fourier Series for Image Restoration,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96108,"Sifei Liu, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz","In this paper, we introduce Cosine Autoencoder (CosAE), a novel, generic Autoencoder that seamlessly leverages the classic Fourier series with a feed-forward neural network. CosAE represents an input image as a series of 2D Cosine time series, each defined by a tuple of learnable frequency and Fourier coefficients. This method stands in contrast to a conventional Autoencoder that often sacrifices detail in their reduced-resolution bottleneck latent spaces. CosAE, however, encodes frequency coefficients, i.e., the amplitudes and phases, in its bottleneck. This encoding enables extreme spatial compression, e.g., $64\times$ downsampled feature maps in the bottleneck, without losing detail upon decoding. We showcase the advantage of CosAE via extensive experiments on flexible-resolution super-resolution and blind image restoration, two highly challenging tasks that demand the restoration network to effectively generalize to complex and even unknown image degradations. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its capability to learn a generalizable representation for image restoration.

Poster,COSMIC: Compress Satellite Image Efficiently via Diffusion Compensation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93986,"Ziyuan Zhang, Han Qiu, Maosen Zhang, Jun Liu, Bin Chen, Tianwei Zhang, Hewu Li","With the rapidly increasing number of satellites in space and their enhanced capabilities, the amount of earth observation images collected by satellites is exceeding the transmission limits of satellite-to-ground links. Although existing learned image compression solutions achieve remarkable performance by using a sophisticated encoder to extract fruitful features as compression and using a decoder to reconstruct. It is still hard to directly deploy those complex encoders on current satellites' embedded GPUs with limited computing capability and power supply to compress images in orbit. In this paper, we propose COSMIC, a simple yet effective learned compression solution to transmit satellite images. We first design a lightweight encoder (i.e. reducing FLOPs by 2.5~5X) on satellite to achieve a high image compression ratio to save satellite-to-ground links. Then, for reconstructions on the ground, to deal with the feature extraction ability degradation due to simplifying encoders, we propose a diffusion-based model to compensate image details when decoding. Our insight is that satellite's earth observation photos are not just images but indeed multi-modal data with a nature of Text-to-Image pairing since they are collected with rich sensor data (e.g. coordinates, timestep, etc.) that can be used as the condition for diffusion generation.  Extensive experiments show that COSMIC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both perceptual and distortion metrics."
Poster,Cost-aware Bayesian Optimization via the Pandora's Box Gittins Index,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95339,"Qian Xie, Raul Astudillo, Peter Frazier, Ziv Scully, Alexander Terenin","Bayesian optimization is a technique for efficiently optimizing unknown functions in a black-box manner. To handle practical settings where gathering data requires use of finite resources, it is desirable to explicitly incorporate function evaluation costs into Bayesian optimization policies. To understand how to do so, we develop a previously-unexplored connection between cost-aware Bayesian optimization and the Pandora's Box problem, a decision problem from economics. The Pandora's Box problem admits a Bayesian-optimal solution based on an expression called the Gittins index, which can be reinterpreted as an acquisition function. We study the use of this acquisition function for cost-aware Bayesian optimization, and demonstrate empirically that it performs well, particularly in medium-high dimensions. We further show that this performance carries over to classical Bayesian optimization without explicit evaluation costs. Our work constitutes a first step towards integrating techniques from Gittins index theory into Bayesian optimization."
Poster,Cost-efficient Knowledge-based Question Answering with Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93534,"Junnan Dong, Qinggang Zhang, Chuang Zhou, Hao Chen, Daochen Zha, Xiao Huang","Knowledge-based question answering (KBQA) is widely used in many scenarios that necessitate domain knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) bring opportunities to KBQA, while their costs are significantly higher and absence of domain-specific knowledge during pre-training. We are motivated to combine LLMs and prior small models on knowledge graphs (KGMs) for both inferential accuracy and cost saving. However, it remains challenging since accuracy and cost are not readily combined in the optimization as two distinct metrics. It is also laborious for model selection since different models excel in diverse knowledge. To this end, we propose Coke, a novel cost-efficient strategy for KBQA with LLMs, modeled as a tailored multi-armed bandit problem to minimize calls to LLMs within limited budgets. We first formulate the accuracy expectation with a cluster-level Thompson Sampling for either KGMs or LLMs. A context-aware policy is optimized to further distinguish the expert model subject to the question semantics. The overall decision is bounded by the cost regret according to historical expenditure on failures. Extensive experiments showcase the superior performance of Coke, which moves the Pareto frontier with up to 20.89% saving of GPT-4 fees while achieving a 2.74% higher accuracy on the benchmark datasets."
Poster,CoSW: Conditional Sample Weighting for Smoke Segmentation with Label Noise,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95170,"Lujian Yao, Haitao Zhao, Zhongze Wang, Kaijie Zhao, Jingchao Peng","Smoke segmentation is of great importance in precisely identifying the smoke location, enabling timely fire rescue and gas leak detection. However, due to the visual diversity and blurry edges of the non-grid smoke, noisy labels are almost inevitable in large-scale pixel-level smoke datasets. Noisy labels significantly impact the robustness of the model and may lead to serious accidents. Nevertheless, currently, there are no specific methods for addressing noisy labels in smoke segmentation. Smoke differs from regular objects as its transparency varies, causing inconsistent features in the noisy labels. In this paper, we propose a conditional sample weighting (CoSW). CoSW utilizes a multi-prototype framework, where prototypes serve as prior information to apply different weighting criteria to the different feature clusters. A novel regularized within-prototype entropy (RWE) is introduced to achieve CoSW and stable prototype update. The experiments show that our approach achieves SOTA performance on both real-world and synthetic noisy smoke segmentation datasets."
Poster,CoSy: Evaluating Textual Explanations of Neurons,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95204,"Laura Kopf, Philine L Bommer, Anna Hedström, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Marina Höhne, Kirill Bykov","A crucial aspect of understanding the complex nature of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the ability to explain learned concepts within their latent representations. While methods exist to connect neurons to human-understandable textual descriptions, evaluating the quality of these explanations is challenging due to the lack of a unified quantitative approach. We introduce CoSy (Concept Synthesis), a novel, architecture-agnostic framework for evaluating textual explanations of latent neurons. Given textual explanations, our proposed framework uses a generative model conditioned on textual input to create data points representing the explanations. By comparing the neuron's response to these generated data points and control data points, we can estimate the quality of the explanation. We validate our framework through sanity checks and benchmark various neuron description methods for Computer Vision tasks, revealing significant differences in quality."
Poster,Counter-Current Learning: A Biologically Plausible Dual Network Approach for Deep Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95624,"Chia-Hsiang Kao, Bharath Hariharan","Despite its widespread use in neural networks, error backpropagation has faced criticism for its lack of biological plausibility, suffering from issues such as the backward locking problem and the weight transport problem. These limitations have motivated researchers to explore more biologically plausible learning algorithms that could potentially shed light on how biological neural systems adapt and learn. Inspired by the counter-current exchange mechanisms observed in biological systems, we propose counter-current learning (CCL), a biologically plausible framework for credit assignment in deep learning. This framework employs a feedforward network to process input data and a feedback network to process targets, with each network enhancing the other through anti-parallel signal propagation. By leveraging the more informative signals from the bottom layer of the feedback network to guide the updates of the top layer of the feedforward network and vice versa, CCL enables the simultaneous transformation of source inputs to target outputs and the dynamic mutual influence of these transformations.Experimental results on MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and STL-10 datasets using multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks demonstrate that CCL achieves comparable performance to other biological plausible algorithms while offering a more biologically realistic learning mechanism. Furthermore, we showcase the applicability of our approach to an autoencoder task, underscoring its potential for unsupervised representation learning.Our work presents a promising direction for biologically inspired and plausible learning algorithms, offering insights into the mechanisms of learning and adaptation in neural networks."
