Poster,DEFT: Efficient Fine-tuning of Diffusion Models by Learning the Generalised $h$-transform,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96267,"Alexander Denker, Francisco Vargas, Shreyas Padhy, Kieran Didi, Simon Mathis, Riccardo Barbano, Vincent Dutordoir, Emile Mathieu, Urszula Julia Komorowska, Pietro Lió","Generative modelling paradigms based on denoising diffusion processes have emerged as a leading candidate for conditional sampling in inverse problems. In many real-world applications, we often have access to large, expensively trained unconditional diffusion models, which we aim to exploit for improving conditional sampling.Most recent approaches are motivated heuristically and lack a unifying framework, obscuring connections between them. Further, they often suffer from issues such as being very sensitive to hyperparameters, being expensive to train or needing access to weights hidden behind a closed API. In this work, we unify conditional training and sampling using the mathematically well-understood Doob's h-transform. This new perspective allows us to unify many existing methods under a common umbrella. Under this framework, we propose DEFT (Doob's h-transform Efficient FineTuning), a new approach for conditional generation that simply fine-tunes a very small network to quickly learn the conditional $h$-transform, while keeping the larger unconditional network unchanged. DEFT is much faster than existing baselines while achieving state-of-the-art performance across a variety of linear and non-linear benchmarks. On image reconstruction tasks, we achieve speedups of up to 1.6$\times$, while having the best perceptual quality on natural images and reconstruction performance on medical images. Further, we also provide initial experiments on protein motif scaffolding and outperform reconstruction guidance methods."
Poster,DeiSAM: Segment Anything with Deictic Prompting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94385,"Hikaru Shindo, Manuel Brack, Gopika Sudhakaran, Devendra S Dhami, Patrick Schramowski, Kristian Kersting","Large-scale, pre-trained neural networks have demonstrated strong capabilities in various tasks, including zero-shot image segmentation. To identify concrete objects in complex scenes, humans instinctively rely on deictic descriptions in natural language, i.e., referring to something depending on the context such as ""The object that is on the desk and behind the cup."". However, deep learning approaches cannot reliably interpret such deictic representations due to their lack of reasoning capabilities in complex scenarios. To remedy this issue, we propose DeiSAM — a combination of large pre-trained neural networks with differentiable logic reasoners — for deictic promptable segmentation. Given a complex, textual segmentation description, DeiSAM leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate first-order logic rules and performs differentiable forward reasoning on generated scene graphs. Subsequently, DeiSAM segments objects by matching them to the logically inferred image regions. As part of our evaluation, we propose the Deictic Visual Genome (DeiVG) dataset, containing paired visual input and complex, deictic textual prompts. Our empirical results demonstrate that DeiSAM is a substantial improvement over purely data-driven baselines for deictic promptable segmentation."
Poster,Déjà Vu Memorization in Vision–Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95117,"Bargav Jayaraman, Chuan Guo, Kamalika Chaudhuri","Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art representation learning solution, with myriads of downstream applications such as image classification, retrieval and generation. A natural question is whether these models memorize their training data, which also has implications for generalization. We propose a new method for measuring memorization in VLMs, which we call dèjá vu memorization. For VLMs trained on image-caption pairs, we show that the model indeed retains information about individual objects in the training images beyond what can be inferred from correlations or the image caption. We evaluate dèjá vu memorization at both sample and population level, and show that it is significant for OpenCLIP trained on as many as 50M image-caption pairs. Finally, we show that text randomization considerably mitigates memorization risk while only moderately impacting the model’s downstream task performance.  The code is available here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/VLMDejaVu."
Poster,DEL: Discrete Element Learner for Learning 3D Particle Dynamics with Neural Rendering,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96792,"JIAXU WANG, Jingkai SUN, ziyi Zhang, Junhao He, Qiang Zhang, Mingyuan Sun, Renjing Xu","Learning-based simulators show great potential for simulating particle dynamics when 3D groundtruth is available, but per-particle correspondences are not always accessible. The development of neural rendering presents a new solution to this field to learn 3D dynamics from 2D images by inverse rendering. However, existing approaches still suffer from ill-posed natures resulting from the 2D to 3D uncertainty, for example, specific 2D images can correspond with various 3D particle distributions. To mitigate such uncertainty, we consider a conventional, mechanically interpretable framework as the physical priors and extend it to a learning-based version. In brief, we incorporate the learnable graph kernels into the classic Discrete Element Analysis (DEA) framework to implement a novel mechanics-informed network architecture. In this case, the graph networks are only used for approximating some specific mechanical operators in the DEA framework rather than the whole dynamics mapping. By integrating the strong physics priors, our methods can effectively learn the dynamics of various materials from the partial 2D observations in a unified manner. Experiments show that our approach outperforms other learned simulators by a large margin in this context and is robust to different renderers, fewer training samples, and fewer camera views."
Poster,Delta-CoMe: Training-Free Delta-Compression with Mixed-Precision for Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94378,"Bowen Ping, Shuo Wang, Hanqing Wang, Xu Han, Yuzhuang Xu, Yukun Yan, Yun Chen, Baobao Chang, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun","Fine-tuning is a crucial process for adapting large language models (LLMs) to diverse applications. In certain scenarios, such as multi-tenant serving, deploying multiple LLMs becomes necessary to meet complex demands. Recent studies suggest decomposing a fine-tuned LLM into a base model and corresponding delta weights, which are then compressed using low-rank or low-bit approaches to reduce costs. In this work, we observe that existing low-rank and low-bit compression methods can significantly harm the model performance for task-specific fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., WizardMath for math problems). Motivated by the long-tail distribution of singular values in the delta weights, we propose a delta quantization approach using mixed-precision. This method employs higher-bit representation for singular vectors corresponding to larger singular values. We evaluate our approach on various fine-tuned LLMs, including math LLMs, code LLMs, chat LLMs, and even VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs comparably to full fine-tuned LLMs, surpassing both low-rank and low-bit baselines by a considerable margin. Additionally, we show that our method is compatible with various backbone LLMs, such as Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral, highlighting its generalizability."
Poster,DeltaDEQ: Exploiting Heterogeneous Convergence for Accelerating Deep Equilibrium Iterations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96425,"Zuowen Wang, Longbiao Cheng, Pehuen Moure, Niklas Hahn, Shih-Chii Liu","Implicit neural networks including deep equilibrium models have achieved superior task performance with better parameter efficiency in various applications. However, it is often at the expense of higher computation costs during inference. In this work, we identify a phenomenon named $\textbf{heterogeneous convergence}$ that exists in deep equilibrium models and other iterative methods. We observe much faster convergence of state activations in certain dimensions therefore indicating the dimensionality of the underlying dynamics of the forward pass is much lower than the defined dimension of the states. We thereby propose to exploit heterogeneous convergence by storing past linear operation results (e.g., fully connected and convolutional layers) and only propagating the state activation when its change exceeds a threshold. Thus, for the already converged dimensions, the computations can be skipped. We verified our findings and reached 84\% FLOPs reduction on the implicit neural representation task, 73\% on the Sintel and 76\% on the KITTI datasets for the optical flow estimation task while keeping comparable task accuracy with the models that perform the full update."
Poster,"DeltaDock: A Unified Framework for Accurate, Efficient, and Physically Reliable Molecular Docking",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94333,"Jiaxian Yan, ZAIXI ZHANG, Jintao Zhu, Kai Zhang, Jianfeng Pei, Qi Liu","Molecular docking, a technique for predicting ligand binding poses, is crucial in structure-based drug design for understanding protein-ligand interactions. Recent advancements in docking methods, particularly those leveraging geometric deep learning (GDL), have demonstrated significant efficiency and accuracy advantages over traditional sampling methods. Despite these advancements, current methods are often tailored for specific docking settings, and limitations such as the neglect of protein side-chain structures, difficulties in handling large binding pockets, and challenges in predicting physically valid structures exist. To accommodate various docking settings and achieve accurate, efficient, and physically reliable docking, we propose a novel two-stage docking framework, DeltaDock, consisting of pocket prediction and site-specific docking. We innovatively reframe the pocket prediction task as a pocket-ligand alignment problem rather than direct prediction in the first stage. Then we follow a bi-level coarse-to-fine iterative refinement process to perform site-specific docking.  Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of DeltaDock. Notably, in the blind docking setting, DeltaDock achieves a 31\% relative improvement over the docking success rate compared with the previous state-of-the-art GDL model DiffDock. With the consideration of physical validity, this improvement increases to about 300\%."
Poster,Delving into the Reversal Curse: How Far Can Large Language Models Generalize?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96840,"Zhengkai Lin, Zhihang Fu, Kai Liu, Liang Xie, Binbin Lin, Wenxiao Wang, Deng Cai, Yue Wu, Jieping Ye","While large language models (LLMs) showcase unprecedented capabilities, they also exhibit certain inherent limitations when facing seemingly trivial tasks. A prime example is the recently debated ""reversal curse"", which surfaces when models, having been trained on the fact ""A is B"", struggle to generalize this knowledge to infer that ""B is A"".In this paper, we examine the manifestation of the reversal curse across various tasks and delve into both the generalization abilities and the problem-solving mechanisms of LLMs. This investigation leads to a series of significant insights:(1) LLMs are able to generalize to ""B is A"" when both A and B are presented in the context as in the case of a multiple-choice question.(2) This generalization ability is highly correlated to the structure of the fact ""A is B"" in the training documents. For example, this generalization only applies to biographies structured in ""[Name] is [Description]"" but not to ""[Description] is [Name]"".(3) We propose and verify the hypothesis that LLMs possess an inherent bias in fact recalling during knowledge application, which explains and underscores the importance of the document structure to successful learning.(4) The negative impact of this bias on the downstream performance of LLMs can hardly be mitigated through training alone.Based on these intriguing findings, our work not only presents a novel perspective for interpreting LLMs' generalization abilities from their intrinsic working mechanism but also provides new insights for the development of more effective learning methods for LLMs."
Poster,DeMo: Decoupling Motion Forecasting into  Directional Intentions and Dynamic States,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93426,"Bozhou Zhang, Nan Song, Li Zhang","Accurate motion forecasting for traffic agents is crucial for ensuring the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving systems in dynamically changing environments. Mainstream methods adopt a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm, where each query corresponds to a unique trajectory for predicting multi-modal trajectories. While straightforward and effective, the absence of detailed representation of future trajectories may yield suboptimal outcomes, given that the agent states dynamically evolve over time. To address this problem, we introduce DeMo, a framework that decouples multi-modal trajectory queries into two types: mode queries capturing distinct directional intentions and state queries tracking the agent's dynamic states over time. By leveraging this format, we separately optimize the multi-modality and dynamic evolutionary properties of trajectories. Subsequently, the mode and state queries are integrated to obtain a comprehensive and detailed representation of the trajectories. To achieve these operations, we additionally introduce combined Attention and Mamba techniques for global information aggregation and state sequence modeling, leveraging their respective strengths. Extensive experiments on both the Argoverse 2 and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that our DeMo achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion forecasting. In addition, we will make our code and models publicly available."
Poster,Demystify Mamba in Vision: A Linear Attention Perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95559,"Dongchen Han, Ziyi Wang, Zhuofan Xia, Yizeng Han, Yifan Pu, Chunjiang Ge, Jun Song, Shiji Song, Bo Zheng, Gao Huang","Mamba is an effective state space model with linear computation complexity. It has recently shown impressive efficiency in dealing with high-resolution inputs across various vision tasks. In this paper, we reveal that the powerful Mamba model shares surprising similarities with linear attention Transformer, which typically underperform conventional Transformer in practice. By exploring the similarities and disparities between the effective Mamba and subpar linear attention Transformer, we provide comprehensive analyses to demystify the key factors behind Mamba’s success. Specifically, we reformulate the selective state space model and linear attention within a unified formulation, rephrasing Mamba as a variant of linear attention Transformer with six major distinctions: input gate, forget gate, shortcut, no attention normalization, single-head, and modified block design. For each design, we meticulously analyze its pros and cons, and empirically evaluate its impact on model performance in vision tasks. Interestingly, the results highlight the forget gate and block design as the core contributors to Mamba’s success, while the other four designs are less crucial. Based on these findings, we propose a Mamba-Inspired Linear Attention (MILA) model by incorporating the merits of these two key designs into linear attention. The resulting model outperforms various vision Mamba models in both image classification and high-resolution dense prediction tasks, while enjoying parallelizable computation and fast inference speed.
