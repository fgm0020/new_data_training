Poster,Taming the Long Tail in Human Mobility Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93152,"Xiaohang Xu, Renhe Jiang, Chuang Yang, zipei fan, Kaoru Sezaki","With the popularity of location-based services, human mobility prediction plays a key role in enhancing personalized navigation, optimizing recommendation systems, and facilitating urban mobility and planning. This involves predicting a user's next POI (point-of-interest) visit using their past visit history. However, the uneven distribution of visitations over time and space, namely the long-tail problem in spatial distribution, makes it difficult for AI models to predict those POIs that are less visited by humans. In light of this issue, we propose the $\underline{\bf{Lo}}$ng-$\underline{\bf{T}}$ail Adjusted $\underline{\bf{Next}}$ POI Prediction (LoTNext) framework for mobility prediction, combining a Long-Tailed Graph Adjustment module to reduce the impact of the long-tailed nodes in the user-POI interaction graph and a novel Long-Tailed Loss Adjustment module to adjust loss by logit score and sample weight adjustment strategy. Also, we employ the auxiliary prediction task to enhance generalization and accuracy. Our experiments with two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that LoTNext significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art works."
Poster,Tangent Space Causal Inference: Leveraging Vector Fields for Causal Discovery in Dynamical Systems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96180,"Kurt Butler, Daniel Waxman, Petar Djuric","Causal discovery with time series data remains a challenging yet increasingly important task across many scientific domains. Convergent cross mapping (CCM) and related methods have been proposed to study time series that are generated by dynamical systems, where traditional approaches like Granger causality are unreliable. However, CCM often yields inaccurate results depending upon the quality of the data. We propose the Tangent Space Causal Inference (TSCI) method for detecting causalities in dynamical systems. TSCI works by considering vector fields as explicit representations of the systems' dynamics and checks for the degree of synchronization between the learned vector fields. The TSCI approach is model-agnostic and can be used as a drop-in replacement for CCM and its generalizations. We first present a basic version of the TSCI algorithm, which is shown to be more effective than the basic CCM algorithm with very little additional computation. We additionally present augmented versions of TSCI that leverage the expressive power of latent variable models and deep learning. We validate our theory on standard systems, and we demonstrate improved causal inference performance across a number of benchmark tasks."
Poster,TAPTRv2: Attention-based Position Update Improves Tracking Any Point,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96113,"Hongyang Li, Hao Zhang, Shilong Liu, Zhaoyang Zeng, Feng Li, Bohan Li, Tianhe Ren, Lei Zhang","In this paper, we present TAPTRv2, a Transformer-based approach built upon TAPTR for solving the Tracking Any Point (TAP) task. TAPTR borrows designs from DEtection TRansformer (DETR) and formulates each tracking point as a point query, making it possible to leverage well-studied operations in DETR-like algorithms. TAPTRv2 improves TAPTR by addressing a critical issue regarding its reliance on cost-volume, which contaminates the point query’s content feature and negatively impacts both visibility prediction and cost-volume computation. In TAPTRv2, we propose a novel attention-based position update (APU) operation and use key-aware deformable attention to realize. For each query, this operation uses key-aware attention weights to combine their corresponding deformable sampling positions to predict a new query position. This design is based on the observation that local attention is essentially the same as cost-volume, both of which are computed by dot-production between a query and its surrounding features. By introducing this new operation, TAPTRv2 not only removes the extra burden of cost-volume computation, but also leads to a substantial performance improvement. TAPTRv2 surpasses TAPTR and achieves state-of-the-art performance on many challenging datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach."
Poster,TAPVid-3D: A Benchmark for Tracking Any Point in 3D,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97673,"Skanda Koppula, Ignacio Rocco, Yi Yang, joseph heyward, Joao Carreira, Andrew Zisserman, Gabriel Brostow, Carl Doersch","We introduce a new benchmark, TAPVid-3D, for evaluating the task of long-range Tracking Any Point in 3D (TAP-3D). While point tracking in two dimensions (TAP-2D) has many benchmarks measuring performance on real-world videos, such as TAPVid-DAVIS, three-dimensional point tracking has none. To this end, leveraging existing footage, we build a new benchmark for 3D point tracking featuring 4,000+ real-world videos, composed of three different data sources spanning a variety of object types, motion patterns, and indoor and outdoor environments. To measure performance on the TAP-3D task, we formulate a collection of metrics that extend the Jaccard-based metric used in TAP-2D to handle the complexities of ambiguous depth scales across models, occlusions, and multi-track spatio-temporal smoothness. We manually verify a large sample of trajectories to ensure correct video annotations, and assess the current state of the TAP-3D task by constructing competitive baselines using existing tracking models. We anticipate this benchmark will serve as a guidepost to improve our ability to understand precise 3D motion and surface deformation from monocular video."
Poster,Targeted Sequential Indirect Experiment Design,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94994,"Elisabeth Ailer, Niclas Dern, Jason Hartford, Niki Kilbertus","Scientific hypotheses typically concern specific aspects of complex, imperfectly understood or entirely unknown mechanisms, such as the effect of gene expression levels on phenotypes or how microbial communities influence environmental health. Such queries are inherently causal (rather than purely associational), but in many settings, experiments can not be conducted directly on the target variables of interest, but are indirect. Therefore, they perturb the target variable, but do not remove potential confounding factors. If, additionally, the resulting experimental measurements are high-dimensional and the studied mechanisms nonlinear, the query of interest is generally not identified. We develop an adaptive strategy to design indirect experiments that optimally inform a targeted query about the ground truth mechanism in terms of sequentially narrowing the gap between an upper and lower bound on the query. While the general formulation consists of a bi-level optimization procedure, we derive an efficiently estimable analytical kernel-based estimator of the bounds for the causal effect, a query of key interest, and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in confounded, multivariate, nonlinear synthetic settings."
Poster,Target-Guided Adversarial Point Cloud Transformer Towards Recognition Against Real-world Corruptions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95955,"Jie Wang, Tingfa Xu, Lihe Ding, Jianan Li","Achieving robust 3D perception in the face of corrupted data presents an challenging hurdle within 3D vision research. Contemporary transformer-based point cloud recognition models, albeit advanced, tend to overfit to specific patterns, consequently undermining their robustness against corruption. In this work, we introduce the Target-Guided Adversarial Point Cloud Transformer, termed APCT, a novel architecture designed to augment global structure capture through an adversarial feature erasing mechanism predicated on patterns discerned at each step during training. Specifically, APCT integrates an Adversarial Significance Identifier and a Target-guided Promptor. The Adversarial Significance Identifier, is tasked with discerning token significance by integrating global contextual analysis, utilizing a structural salience index algorithm alongside an auxiliary supervisory mechanism. The Target-guided Promptor, is responsible for accentuating the propensity for token discard within the self-attention mechanism, utilizing the value derived above, consequently directing the model attention towards alternative segments in subsequent stages. By iteratively applying this strategy in multiple steps during training, the network progressively identifies and integrates an expanded array of object-associated patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple corruption benchmarks."
Poster,TARP-VP: Towards Evaluation of Transferred  Adversarial Robustness and Privacy on Label  Mapping Visual Prompting Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94219,"Zhen Chen, Yi Zhang, Fu Wang, Xingyu Zhao, Xiaowei Huang, Wenjie Ruan","Adversarial robustness and privacy of deep learning (DL) models are two widely studied topics in AI security. Adversarial training (AT) is an effective approach to improve the robustness of DL models against adversarial attacks. However, while models with AT demonstrate enhanced robustness, they become more susceptible to membership inference attacks (MIAs), thus increasing the risk of privacy leakage. This indicates a negative trade-off between adversarial robustness and privacy in general deep learning models. Visual prompting is a novel model reprogramming (MR) technique used for fine-tuning pre-trained models, achieving good performance in vision tasks, especially when combined with the label mapping technique. However, the performance of label-mapping-based visual prompting (LM-VP) under adversarial attacks and MIAs lacks evaluation. In this work, we regard the MR of LM-VP as a unified entity, referred to as the LM-VP model, and take a step toward jointly evaluating the adversarial robustness and privacy of LM-VP models. Experimental results show that the choice of pre-trained models significantly affects the white-box adversarial robustness of LM-VP, and standard AT even substantially degrades its performance. In contrast, transfer AT-trained LM-VP achieves a good trade-off between transferred adversarial robustness and privacy, a finding that has been consistently validated across various pre-trained models."
Poster,TARSS-Net: Temporal-Aware Radar Semantic Segmentation Network,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96608,"Youcheng Zhang, Liwen Zhang, ZijunHu, Pengcheng Pi, Teng Li, Yuanpei Chen, Shi Peng, Zhe Ma","Radar signal interpretation plays a crucial role in remote detection and ranging. With the gradual display of the advantages of neural network technology in signal processing, learning-based radar signal interpretation is becoming a research hot-spot and made great progress. And since radar semantic segmentation (RSS) can provide more fine-grained target information, it has become a more concerned direction in this field. However, the temporal information, which is an important clue for analyzing radar data, has not been exploited sufficiently in present RSS frameworks. In this work, we propose a novel temporal information learning paradigm, i.e., data-driven temporal information aggregation with learned target-history relations. Following this idea, a flexible learning module, called Temporal Relation-Aware Module (TRAM) is carefully designed. TRAM contains two main blocks: i) an encoder for capturing the target-history temporal relations (TH-TRE) and ii) a learnable temporal relation attentive pooling (TRAP) for aggregating temporal information. Based on TRAM, an end-to-end Temporal-Aware RSS Network (TARSS-Net) is presented, which has outstanding performance on publicly available and our collected real-measured datasets.

Poster,Task-Agnostic Machine-Learning-Assisted Inference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95664,"Jiacheng Miao, Qiongshi Lu","Machine learning (ML) is playing an increasingly important role in scientific research. In conjunction with classical statistical approaches, ML-assisted analytical strategies have shown great promise in accelerating research findings. This has also opened a whole field of methodological research focusing on integrative approaches that leverage both ML and statistics to tackle data science challenges. One type of study that has quickly gained popularity employs ML to predict unobserved outcomes in massive samples, and then uses predicted outcomes in downstream statistical inference. However, existing methods designed to ensure the validity of this type of post-prediction inference are limited to very basic tasks such as linear regression analysis. This is because any extension of these approaches to new, more sophisticated statistical tasks requires task-specific algebraic derivations and software implementations, which ignores the massive library of existing software tools already developed for the same scientific problem given observed data. This severely constrains the scope of application for post-prediction inference. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel statistical framework named PSPS for task-agnostic ML-assisted inference. It provides a post-prediction inference solution that can be easily plugged into almost any established data analysis routines. It delivers valid and efficient inference that is robust to arbitrary choice of ML model, allowing nearly all existing statistical frameworks to be incorporated into the analysis of ML-predicted data. Through extensive experiments, we showcase our method’s validity, versatility, and superiority compared to existing approaches. Our software is available at https://github.com/qlu-lab/psps."
Poster,TaskBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Task Automation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97613,"Yongliang Shen, Kaitao Song, Xu Tan, Wenqi Zhang, Kan Ren, Siyu Yuan, Weiming Lu, Dongsheng Li, Yueting Zhuang","In recent years, the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) has sparked interest in task automation, which involves decomposing complex tasks described by user instructions into sub-tasks and invoking external tools to execute them, playing a central role in autonomous agents. However, there is a lack of systematic and standardized benchmarks to promote the development of LLMs in task automation. To address this, we introduce TaskBench, a comprehensive framework to evaluate the capability of LLMs in task automation. Specifically, task automation can be divided into three critical stages: task decomposition, tool selection, and parameter prediction. To tackle the complexities inherent in these stages, we introduce the concept of Tool Graph to represent decomposed tasks and adopt a back-instruct method to generate high-quality user instructions. We propose TaskEval, a multi-faceted evaluation methodology that assesses LLM performance across these three stages. Our approach combines automated construction with rigorous human verification, ensuring high consistency with human evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that TaskBench effectively reflects the capabilities of various LLMs in task automation. It provides insights into model performance across different task complexities and domains, pushing the boundaries of what current models can achieve. TaskBench offers a scalable, adaptable, and reliable benchmark for advancing LLM-based autonomous agents."
