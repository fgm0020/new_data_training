Poster,Fourier-enhanced Implicit Neural Fusion Network for Multispectral and Hyperspectral Image Fusion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96117,"YuJie Liang, ZiHan Cao, Shangqi Deng, Hong-Xia Dou, Liang-Jian Deng","Recently, implicit neural representations (INR) have made significant strides in various vision-related domains, providing a novel solution for Multispectral and Hyperspectral Image Fusion (MHIF) tasks. However, INR is prone to losing high-frequency information and is confined to the lack of global perceptual capabilities. To address these issues, this paper introduces a Fourier-enhanced Implicit Neural Fusion Network (FeINFN) specifically designed for MHIF task, targeting the following phenomena: The Fourier amplitudes of the HR-HSI latent code and LR-HSI are remarkably similar; however, their phases exhibit different patterns. In FeINFN, we innovatively propose a spatial and frequency implicit fusion function (Spa-Fre IFF), helping INR capture high-frequency information and expanding the receptive field. Besides, a new decoder employing a complex Gabor wavelet activation function, called Spatial-Frequency Interactive Decoder (SFID), is invented to enhance the interaction of INR features. Especially, we further theoretically prove that the Gabor wavelet activation possesses a time-frequency tightness property that favors learning the optimal bandwidths in the decoder. Experiments on two benchmark MHIF datasets verify the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of the proposed method, both visually and quantitatively. Also, ablation studies demonstrate the mentioned contributions.  The code can be available at https://github.com/294coder/Efficient-MIF."
Poster,Fourier Neural Operator with Learned Deformations for PDEs on General Geometries,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/98327,"Zongyi Li, Daniel Zhengyu Huang, Burigede Liu, Anima Anandkumar","Deep learning surrogate models have shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Among them, the Fourier neural operator (FNO) achieves good accuracy, and is significantly faster compared to numerical solvers,  on a variety of   PDEs, such as fluid flows. However, the FNO uses the Fast Fourier transform  (FFT), which is limited to rectangular domains with uniform grids. In this work, we propose a new framework, viz., Geo-FNO, to solve PDEs on arbitrary geometries. Geo-FNO learns to deform the input (physical) domain, which may be irregular, into a latent space with a uniform grid. The FNO model with the FFT is applied in the latent space. The resulting Geo-FNO model has both the computation efficiency of FFT and the flexibility of handling arbitrary geometries. Our Geo-FNO is also flexible in terms of its input formats, viz.,  point clouds, meshes, and design parameters are all valid inputs. We consider a variety of PDEs such as the Elasticity, Plasticity, Euler's, and Navier-Stokes equations, and both forward modeling and inverse design problems. Comprehensive cost-accuracy experiments show that Geo-FNO is $10^5$ times faster than the standard numerical solvers and twice more accurate compared to direct interpolation on existing ML-based PDE solvers such as the standard FNO."
Poster,Fractal Patterns May Illuminate the Success of Next-Token Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94393,"Ibrahim Alabdulmohsin, Vinh Tran, Mostafa Dehghani","We study the fractal structure of language, aiming to provide a precise formalism for quantifying properties that may have been previously suspected but not  formally shown. We establish that language is: (1) self-similar, exhibiting complexities at all levels of granularity, with no particular characteristic context length, and (2) long-range dependent (LRD), with a Hurst parameter of approximately 0.7.Based on these findings, we argue that short-term patterns/dependencies in language, such as in paragraphs, mirror the patterns/dependencies over larger scopes, like entire documents. This may shed some light on how  next-token prediction can capture the structure of text across multiple levels of granularity, from words and clauses to broader contexts and intents. In addition, we carry out an extensive analysis across different domains and architectures, showing that fractal parameters are robust.Finally, we demonstrate that the tiny variations  in fractal parameters seen across LLMs improve upon perplexity-based bits-per-byte (BPB) in predicting their downstream performance. We hope these findings offer a fresh perspective on language and the mechanisms underlying the success of LLMs."
Poster,FreeLong: Training-Free Long Video Generation with SpectralBlend Temporal Attention,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94789,"Yu Lu, Yuanzhi Liang, Linchao Zhu, Yi Yang","Video diffusion models have made substantial progress in various video generation applications. However, training models for long video generation tasks require significant computational and data resources, posing a challenge to developing long video diffusion models.This paper investigates a straightforward and training-free approach to extend an existing short video diffusion model (e.g. pre-trained on 16-frame videos) for consistent long video generation (e.g. 128 frames).  Our preliminary observation has found that directly applying the short video diffusion model to generate long videos can lead to severe video quality degradation. Further investigation reveals that this degradation is primarily due to the distortion of high-frequency components in long videos, characterized by a decrease in spatial high-frequency components and an increase in temporal high-frequency components. Motivated by this, we propose a novel solution named FreeLong to balance the frequency distribution of long video features during the denoising process. FreeLong blends the low-frequency components of global video features, which encapsulate the entire video sequence, with the high-frequency components of local video features that focus on shorter subsequences of frames. This approach maintains global consistency while incorporating diverse and high-quality spatiotemporal details from local videos, enhancing both the consistency and fidelity of long video generation. We evaluated FreeLong on multiple base video diffusion models and observed significant improvements. Additionally, our method supports coherent multi-prompt generation, ensuring both visual coherence and seamless transitions between scenes. Our project page is at: https://yulu.net.cn/freelong."
Poster,Free Lunch in Pathology Foundation Model: Task-specific Model Adaptation with Concept-Guided Feature Enhancement,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94308,"Yanyan Huang, Weiqin Zhao, Yihang Chen, Yu Fu, Lequan Yu","Whole slide image (WSI) analysis is gaining prominence within the medical imaging field. Recent advances in pathology foundation models have shown the potential to extract powerful feature representations from WSIs for downstream tasks. However, these foundation models are usually designed for general-purpose pathology image analysis and may not be optimal for specific downstream tasks or cancer types. In this work, we present Concept Anchor-guided Task-specific Feature Enhancement (CATE), an adaptable paradigm that can boost the expressivity and discriminativeness of pathology foundation models for specific downstream tasks. Based on a set of task-specific concepts derived from the pathology vision-language model with expert-designed prompts, we introduce two interconnected modules to dynamically calibrate the generic image features extracted by foundation models for certain tasks or cancer types. Specifically, we design a Concept-guided Information Bottleneck module to enhance task-relevant characteristics by maximizing the mutual information between image features and concept anchors while suppressing superfluous information. Moreover, a Concept-Feature Interference module is proposed to utilize the similarity between calibrated features and concept anchors to further generate discriminative task-specific features. The extensive experiments on public WSI datasets demonstrate that CATE significantly enhances the performance and generalizability of MIL models. Additionally, heatmap and umap visualization results also reveal the effectiveness and interpretability of CATE."
Poster,Free-Rider and Conflict Aware Collaboration Formation for Cross-Silo Federated Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95480,"Mengmeng Chen, Xiaohu Wu, Xiaoli Tang, Tiantian He, Yew Soon Ong, QIQI LIU, Qicheng Lao, Han Yu","Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows multiple FL participants (FL-PTs) to collaborate on training models without sharing private data. Due to data heterogeneity, negative transfer may occur in the FL training process. This necessitates FL-PT selection based on their data complementarity. In cross-silo FL, organizations that engage in business activities are key sources of FL-PTs. The resulting FL ecosystem has two features: (i) self-interest, and (ii) competition among FL-PTs. This requires the desirable FL-PT selection strategy to simultaneously mitigate the problems of free riders and conflicts of interest among competitors. To this end, we propose an optimal FL collaboration formation strategy -FedEgoists- which ensures that: (1) a FL-PT can benefit from FL if and only if it benefits the FL ecosystem, and (2) a FL-PT will not contribute to its competitors or their supporters. It provides an efficient clustering solution to group FL-PTs into coalitions, ensuring that within each coalition, FL-PTs share the same interest. We theoretically prove that the FL-PT coalitions formed are optimal since no coalitions can collaborate together to improve the utility of any of their members. Extensive experiments on widely adopted benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FedEgoists compared to nine state-of-the-art baseline methods, and its ability to establish efficient collaborative networks in cross-silos FL with FL-PTs that engage in business activities."
Poster,FreeSplat: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting Towards Free View Synthesis of Indoor Scenes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93734,"Yunsong Wang, Tianxin Huang, Hanlin Chen, Gim Hee Lee","Empowering 3D Gaussian Splatting with generalization ability is appealing. However, existing generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting methods are largely confined to narrow-range interpolation between stereo images due to their heavy backbones, thus lacking the ability to accurately localize 3D Gaussian and support free-view synthesis across wide view range. In this paper, we present a novel framework FreeSplat that is capable of reconstructing geometrically consistent 3D scenes from long sequence input towards free-view synthesis.Specifically, we firstly introduce Low-cost Cross-View Aggregation achieved by constructing adaptive cost volumes among nearby views and aggregating features using a multi-scale structure. Subsequently, we present the Pixel-wise Triplet Fusion to eliminate redundancy of 3D Gaussians in overlapping view regions and to aggregate features observed across multiple views. Additionally, we propose a simple but effective free-view training strategy that ensures robust view synthesis across broader view range regardless of the number of views. Our empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art novel view synthesis peformances in both novel view rendered color maps quality and depth maps accuracy across different numbers of input views. We also show that FreeSplat performs inference more efficiently and can effectively reduce redundant Gaussians, offering the possibility of feed-forward large scene reconstruction without depth priors. Our code will be made open-source upon paper acceptance."
Poster,FreqBlender: Enhancing DeepFake Detection by Blending Frequency Knowledge,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93596,"hanzhe li, Jiaran Zhou, Yuezun Li, Baoyuan Wu, Bin Li, Junyu Dong","Generating synthetic fake faces, known as pseudo-fake faces, is an effective way to improve the generalization of DeepFake detection. Existing methods typically generate these faces by blending real or fake faces in spatial domain. While these methods have shown promise, they overlook the simulation of frequency distribution in pseudo-fake faces, limiting the learning of generic forgery traces in-depth. To address this, this paper introduces {\em FreqBlender}, a new method that can generate pseudo-fake faces by blending frequency knowledge. Concretely, we investigate the major frequency components and propose a Frequency Parsing Network to adaptively partition frequency components related to forgery traces. Then we blend this frequency knowledge from fake faces into real faces to generate pseudo-fake faces. Since there is no ground truth for frequency components, we describe a dedicated training strategy by leveraging the inner correlations among different frequency knowledge to instruct the learning process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enhancing DeepFake detection, making it a potential plug-and-play strategy for other methods."
Poster,FreqMark: Invisible Image Watermarking via Frequency Based Optimization in Latent Space,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96959,"YiYang Guo, Ruizhe Li, Mude Hui, Hanzhong Guo, Chen Zhang, Chuangjian Cai, Le Wan, shangfei wang","Invisible watermarking is essential for safeguarding digital content, enabling copyright protection and content authentication. However, existing watermarking methods fall short in robustness against regeneration attacks.In this paper, we propose a novel method called FreqMark that involves unconstrained optimization of the image latent frequency space obtained after VAE encoding. Specifically, FreqMark embeds the watermark by optimizing the latent frequency space of the images and then extracts the watermark through a pre-trained image encoder. This optimization allows a flexible trade-off between image quality with watermark robustness and effectively resists regeneration attacks.Experimental results demonstrate that FreqMark offers significant advantages in image quality and robustness, permits flexible selection of the encoding bit number, and achieves a bit accuracy exceeding 90\% when encoding a 48-bit hidden message under various attack scenarios."
Poster,Frequency Adaptive Normalization For Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95063,"Weiwei Ye, Songgaojun Deng, Qiaosha Zou, Ning Gui","Time series forecasting typically needs to address non-stationary data with evolving trend and seasonal patterns. To address the non-stationarity, reversible instance normalization has been recently proposed to alleviate impacts from the trend with certain statistical measures, e.g., mean and variance. Although they  demonstrate improved predictive accuracy, they are limited to expressing basic trends and are incapable of handling seasonal patterns. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a new instance normalization solution, called frequency adaptive normalization (FAN), which extends instance normalization in handling both dynamic trend and seasonal patterns. Specifically, we employ the Fourier transform to identify instance-wise predominant frequent components that cover most non-stationary factors. Furthermore,  the discrepancy of those frequency components between inputs and outputs is explicitly modeled as a prediction task with a simple MLP model. FAN is a model-agnostic method that can be applied to arbitrary predictive backbones.  We instantiate FAN on four widely used forecasting models as the backbone and evaluate their prediction performance improvements on eight benchmark datasets. FAN demonstrates significant performance advancement, achieving 7.76\%$\sim$37.90\%  average  improvements in MSE. Our code is publicly available at http://github.com/icannotnamemyself/FAN."
