Poster,Typicalness-Aware Learning for Failure Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95120,"Yijun Liu, Jiequan Cui, Zhuotao Tian, Senqiao Yang, Qingdong He, Xiaoling Wang, Jingyong Su","Deep neural networks (DNNs) often suffer from the overconfidence issue, where incorrect predictions are made with high confidence scores, hindering the applications in critical systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Typicalness-Aware Learning (TAL) to address this issue and improve failure detection performance. We observe that, with the cross-entropy loss, model predictions are optimized to align with the corresponding labels via increasing logit magnitude or refining logit direction. However, regarding atypical samples, the image content and their labels may exhibit disparities. This discrepancy can lead to overfitting on atypical samples, ultimately resulting in the overconfidence issue that we aim to address.To address this issue, we have devised a metric that quantifies the typicalness of each sample, enabling the dynamic adjustment of the logit magnitude during the training process. By allowing relatively atypical samples to be adequately fitted while preserving reliable logit direction, the problem of overconfidence can be mitigated. TAL has been extensively evaluated on benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate its superiority over existing failure detection methods. Specifically, TAL achieves a more than 5\% improvement on CIFAR100 in terms of the Area Under the Risk-Coverage Curve (AURC) compared to the state-of-the-art.

Poster,UAV3D: A Large-scale 3D Perception Benchmark for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97488,"hui ye, Rajshekhar Sunderraman, Jonathan Shihao Ji","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), equipped with cameras, are employed in numerous applications, including aerial photography, surveillance, and agriculture. In these applications, robust object detection and tracking are essential for the effective deployment of UAVs. However, existing benchmarks for UAV applications are mainly designed for traditional 2D perception tasks, restricting thedevelopment of real-world applications that require a 3D understanding of the environment. Furthermore, despite recent advancements in single-UAV perception, limited views of a single UAV platform significantly constrain its perception capabilities over long distances or in occluded areas. To address these challenges, we introduce UAV3D – a benchmark designed to advance research in both 3D andcollaborative 3D perception tasks with UAVs. UAV3D comprises 1,000 scenes, each of which has 20 frames with fully annotated 3D bounding boxes on vehicles. We provide the benchmark for four 3D perception tasks: single-UAV 3D object detection, single-UAV object tracking, collaborative-UAV 3D object detection, and collaborative-UAV object tracking. Our dataset and code are available athttps://huiyegit.github.io/UAV3D_Benchmark/."
Poster,UDA: A Benchmark Suite for Retrieval Augmented Generation in Real-World Document Analysis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97735,"Yulong Hui, YAO LU, Huanchen Zhang","The use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has improved Large Language Models (LLMs) in collaborating with external data, yet significant challenges exist in real-world scenarios. In areas such as academic literature and finance question answering, data are often found in raw text and tables in HTML or PDF formats, which can be lengthy and highly unstructured. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark suite, namely Unstructured Document Analysis (UDA), that involves 2,965 real-world documents and 29,590 expert-annotated Q&A pairs. We revisit popular LLM- and RAG-based solutions for document analysis and evaluate the design choices and answer qualities across multiple document domains and diverse query types. Our evaluation yields interesting findings and highlights the importance of data parsing and retrieval.  We hope our benchmark can shed light and better serve real-world document analysis applications. The benchmark suite and code can be found at https://github.com/qinchuanhui/UDA-Benchmark"
Poster,UDC: A Unified Neural Divide-and-Conquer Framework for Large-Scale Combinatorial Optimization Problems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94355,"Zhi Zheng, Changliang Zhou, Tong Xialiang, Mingxuan Yuan, Zhenkun Wang","Single-stage neural combinatorial optimization solvers have achieved near-optimal results on various small-scale combinatorial optimization (CO) problems without requiring expert knowledge. However, these solvers exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to large-scale CO problems. Recently, two-stage neural methods motivated by divide-and-conquer strategies have shown efficiency in addressing large-scale CO problems. Nevertheless, the performance of these methods highly relies on problem-specific heuristics in either the dividing or the conquering procedure, which limits their applicability to general CO problems. Moreover, these methods employ separate training schemes and ignore the interdependencies between the dividing and conquering strategies, often leading to sub-optimal solutions. To tackle these drawbacks, this article develops a unified neural divide-and-conquer framework (i.e., UDC) for solving general large-scale CO problems. UDC offers a Divide-Conquer-Reunion (DCR) training method to eliminate the negative impact of a sub-optimal dividing policy. Employing a high-efficiency Graph Neural Network (GNN) for global instance dividing and a fixed-length sub-path solver for conquering divided sub-problems, the proposed UDC framework demonstrates extensive applicability, achieving superior performance in 10 representative large-scale CO problems.

Poster,U-DiTs: Downsample Tokens in U-Shaped Diffusion Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95100,"Yuchuan Tian, Zhijun Tu, Hanting Chen, Jie Hu, Chao Xu, Yunhe Wang","Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) introduce the transformer architecture to diffusion tasks for latent-space image generation. With an isotropic architecture that chains a series of transformer blocks, DiTs demonstrate competitive performance and good scalability; but meanwhile, the abandonment of U-Net by DiTs and their following improvements is worth rethinking. To this end, we conduct a simple toy experiment by comparing a U-Net architectured DiT with an isotropic one. It turns out that the U-Net architecture only gain a slight advantage amid the U-Net inductive bias, indicating potential redundancies within the U-Net-style DiT. Inspired by the discovery that U-Net backbone features are low-frequency-dominated, we perform token downsampling on the query-key-value tuple for self-attention and bring further improvements despite a considerable amount of reduction in computation. Based on self-attention with downsampled tokens, we propose a series of U-shaped DiTs (U-DiTs) in the paper and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the extraordinary performance of U-DiT models. The proposed U-DiT could outperform DiT-XL with only 1/6 of its computation cost. Codes are available at https://github.com/YuchuanTian/U-DiT."
Poster,UDON: Universal Dynamic Online distillatioN for generic image representations,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94005,"Nikolaos-Antonios Ypsilantis, Kaifeng Chen, Andre Araujo, Ondrej Chum","Universal image representations are critical in enabling real-world fine-grained and instance-level recognition applications, where objects and entities from any domain must be identified at large scale.Despite recent advances, existing methods fail to capture important domain-specific knowledge, while also ignoring differences in data distribution across different domains.This leads to a large performance gap between efficient universal solutions and expensive approaches utilising a collection of specialist models, one for each domain.In this work, we make significant strides towards closing this gap, by introducing a new learning technique, dubbed UDON (Universal Dynamic Online distillatioN).UDON employs multi-teacher distillation, where each teacher is specialized in one domain, to transfer detailed domain-specific knowledge into the student universal embedding.UDON's distillation approach is not only effective, but also very efficient, by sharing most model parameters between the student and all teachers, where all models are jointly trained in an online manner.UDON also comprises a sampling technique which adapts the training process to dynamically allocate batches to domains which are learned slower and require more frequent processing.This boosts significantly the learning of complex domains which are characterised by a large number of classes and long-tail distributions.With comprehensive experiments, we validate each component of UDON, and showcase significant improvements over the state of the art in the recent UnED benchmark.Code: https://github.com/nikosips/UDON."
Poster,UDPM: Upsampling Diffusion Probabilistic Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96290,"Shady Abu-Hussein, Raja Giryes","Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) have recently gained significant attention. DDPMs compose a Markovian process that begins in the data domain and gradually adds noise until reaching pure white noise. DDPMs generate high-quality samples from complex data distributions by defining an inverse process and training a deep neural network to learn this mapping. However, these models are inefficient because they require many diffusion steps to produce aesthetically pleasing samples. Additionally, unlike generative adversarial networks (GANs), the latent space of diffusion models is less interpretable. In this work, we propose to generalize the denoising diffusion process into an Upsampling Diffusion Probabilistic Model (UDPM). In the forward process, we reduce the latent variable dimension through downsampling, followed by the traditional noise perturbation. As a result, the reverse process gradually denoises and upsamples the latent variable to produce a sample from the data distribution. We formalize the Markovian diffusion processes of UDPM and demonstrate its generation capabilities on the popular FFHQ, AFHQv2, and CIFAR10 datasets. UDPM generates images with as few as three network evaluations, whose overall computational cost is less than a single DDPM or EDM step while achieving an FID score of 6.86. This surpasses current state-of-the-art efficient diffusion models that use a single denoising step for sampling. Additionally, UDPM offers an interpretable and interpolable latent space, which gives it an advantage over traditional DDPMs. Our code is available online: \url{https://github.com/shadyabh/UDPM/}"
Poster,UGC: Universal Graph Coarsening,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93695,"Mohit Kataria, Sandeep Kumar, Jayadeva Dr","In the era of big data, graphs have emerged as a natural representation of intricate relationships. However, graph sizes often become unwieldy, leading to storage, computation, and analysis challenges. A crucial demand arises for methods that can effectively downsize large graphs while retaining vital insights. Graph coarsening seeks to simplify large graphs while maintaining the basic statistics of the graphs, such as spectral properties and $\epsilon$-similarity in the coarsened graph. This ensures that downstream processes are more efficient and effective. Most published methods are suitable for homophilic datasets, limiting their universal use. We propose **U**niversal **G**raph **C**oarsening (UGC), a framework equally suitable for homophilic and heterophilic datasets. UGC integrates node attributes and adjacency information, leveraging the dataset's heterophily factor. Results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that UGC preserves spectral similarity while coarsening. In comparison to existing methods, UGC is 4x to 15x faster, has lower eigen-error, and yields superior performance on downstream processing tasks even at 70% coarsening ratios."
Poster,UKnow: A Unified Knowledge Protocol with Multimodal Knowledge Graph Datasets for Reasoning and Vision-Language Pre-Training,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97740,"Biao Gong, Shuai Tan, Yutong Feng, Xiaoying Xie, Yuyuan Li, Chaochao Chen, Kecheng Zheng, Yujun Shen, Deli Zhao","This work presents a unified knowledge protocol, called UKnow, which facilitates knowledge-based studies from the perspective of data. Particularly focusing on visual and linguistic modalities, we categorize data knowledge into five unit types, namely, in-image, in-text, cross-image, cross-text, and image-text, and set up an efficient pipeline to help construct the multimodal knowledge graph from any data collection. Thanks to the logical information naturally contained in knowledge graph, organizing datasets under UKnow format opens up more possibilities of data usage compared to the commonly used image-text pairs. Following UKnow protocol, we collect, from public international news, a large-scale multimodal knowledge graph dataset that consists of 1,388,568 nodes (with 571,791 vision-related ones) and 3,673,817 triplets. The dataset is also annotated with rich event tags, including 11 coarse labels and 9,185 fine labels. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate the potential of UKnow in supporting common-sense reasoning and boosting vision-language pre-training with a single dataset, benefiting from its unified form of knowledge organization. Code, dataset, and models will be made publicly available. See Appendix to download the dataset."
Poster,UltraEdit: Instruction-based Fine-Grained Image Editing at Scale,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97827,"Haozhe Zhao, Xiaojian (Shawn) Ma, Liang Chen, Shuzheng Si, Rujie Wu, Kaikai An, Peiyu Yu, Minjia Zhang, Qing Li, Baobao Chang","This paper presents UltraEdit, a large-scale (~ 4M editing samples), automatically generated dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our key idea is to address the drawbacks in existing image editing datasets like InstructPix2Pix and MagicBrush, and provide a *systematic* approach to producing massive and high-quality image editing samples: 1) UltraEdit includes more diverse editing instructions by combining LLM creativity and in-context editing examples by human raters; 2) UltraEdit is anchored on real images (photographs or artworks), which offers more diversity and less biases than those purely synthesized by text-to-image models; 3) UltraEdit supports region-based editing with high-quality, automatically produced region annotations. Our experiments show that canonical diffusion-based editing baselines trained on UltraEdit set new records on challenging MagicBrush and Emu-Edit benchmarks, respectively. Our analysis further confirms the crucial role of real image anchors and region-based editing data. The dataset, code, and models will be made public."
