Poster,Dynamic Rescaling for Training GNNs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95757,"Nimrah Mustafa, Rebekka Burkholz","Graph neural networks (GNNs) with a rescale invariance, such as GATs, can be re-parameterized during optimization through dynamic rescaling of network parameters and gradients while keeping the loss invariant. In this work, we explore dynamic rescaling as a tool to influence GNN training dynamics in two key ways: i) balancing the network with respect to various criteria, and ii) controlling the relative learning speeds of different layers. We gain novel insights, unique to GNNs, that reveal distinct training modes for different tasks. For heterophilic graphs, achieving balance based on relative gradients leads to faster training and better generalization. In contrast, homophilic graphs benefit from delaying the learning of later layers. Additionally, we show that training in balance supports larger learning rates, which can improve generalization. Moreover, controlling layer-wise training speeds is linked to grokking-like phenomena, which may be of independent interest."
Poster,Dynamic Service Fee Pricing under Strategic Behavior: Actions as Instruments and Phase Transition,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95015,"Rui Ai, David Simchi-Levi, Feng Zhu","We study a dynamic pricing problem for third-party platform service fees under strategic, far-sighted customers. In each time period, the platform sets a service fee based on historical data, observes the resulting transaction quantities, and collects revenue. The platform also monitors equilibrium prices influenced by both demand and supply. The objective is to maximize total revenue over a time horizon $T$. Our problem incorporates three practical challenges: (a) initially, the platform lacks knowledge of the demand side beforehand, necessitating a balance between exploring (learning the demand curve) and exploiting (maximizing revenue) simultaneously; (b) since only equilibrium prices and quantities are observable, traditional Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimators would be biased and inconsistent; (c) buyers are rational and strategic, seeking to maximize their consumer surplus and potentially misrepresenting their preferences. To address these challenges, we propose novel algorithmic solutions. Our approach involves: (i) a carefully designed active randomness injection to balance exploration and exploitation effectively; (ii) using non-i.i.d. actions as instrumental variables (IV) to consistently estimate demand; (iii) a low-switching cost design that promotes nearly truthful buyer behavior. We show an expected regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}} (\sqrt{T}\wedge\sigma_S^{-2})$ and demonstrate its optimality, up to logarithmic factors, with respect to both the time horizon $T$ and the randomness in supply $\sigma_S$. Despite its simplicity, our model offers valuable insights into the use of actions as estimation instruments, the benefits of low-switching pricing policies in mitigating strategic buyer behavior, and the role of supply randomness in facilitating exploration which leads to a phase transition of policy performance."
Poster,Dynamics of Supervised and Reinforcement Learning in the Non-Linear Perceptron,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94317,"Christian Schmid, James M Murray","The ability of a brain or a neural network to efficiently learn depends crucially on both the task structure and the learning rule.Previous works have analyzed the dynamical equations describing learning in the relatively simplified context of the perceptron under assumptions of a student-teacher framework or a linearized output. While these assumptions have facilitated theoretical understanding, they have precluded a detailed understanding of the roles of the nonlinearity and input-data distribution in determining the learning dynamics, limiting the applicability of the theories to real biological or artificial neural networks.Here, we use a stochastic-process approach to derive flow equations describing learning, applying this framework to the case of a nonlinear perceptron performing binary classification. We characterize the effects of the learning rule (supervised or reinforcement learning, SL/RL) and input-data distribution on the perceptron's learning curve and the forgetting curve as subsequent tasks are learned.In particular, we find that the input-data noise differently affects the learning speed under SL vs. RL, as well as determines how quickly learning of a task is overwritten by subsequent learning. Additionally, we verify our approach with real data using the MNIST dataset.This approach points a way toward analyzing learning dynamics for more-complex circuit architectures."
Poster,Dynamic Subgroup Identification in Covariate-adjusted Response-adaptive Randomization Experiments,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96660,"Yanping Li, Jingshen Wang, Waverly Wei","Identifying subgroups with differential responses to treatment is pivotal in randomized clinical trials, as tailoring treatments to specific subgroups can advance personalized medicine. Upon trial completion, identifying best-performing subgroups–those with the most beneficial treatment effects–is crucial for optimizing resource allocation or mitigating adverse treatment effects. However, traditional clinical trials are not customized for the goal of identifying best-performing subgroups because they typically pre-define subgroups at the beginning of the trial and adhere to a fixed subgroup treatment allocation rule, leading to inefficient use of experimental efforts. While some adaptive experimental strategies exist for the identification of the single best subgroup, they commonly do not enable the identification of the best set of subgroups.  To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic subgroup identification covariate-adjusted response-adaptive randomization (CARA) design strategy with the following key features: (i) Our approach is an adaptive experimental strategy that allows the dynamic identification of the best subgroups and the revision of treatment allocation towards the goal of correctly identifying the best subgroups based on collected experimental data. (ii) Our design handles ties between subgroups effectively, merging those with similar treatment effects to maximize experimental efficiency. In the theoretical investigations, we demonstrate that our design has a higher probability of correctly identifying the best set of subgroups compared to conventional designs. Additionally, we prove the statistical validity of our estimator for the best subgroup treatment effect, demonstrating its asymptotic normality and semiparametric efficiency. Finally, we validate our design using synthetic data from a clinical trial on cirrhosis."
Poster,Dynamic Tuning Towards Parameter and Inference Efficiency for ViT Adaptation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94302,"Wangbo Zhao, Jiasheng Tang, Yizeng Han, Yibing Song, Kai Wang, Gao Huang, Fan Wang, Yang You","Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have achieved significant success on vision transformers (ViTs) adaptation by improving parameter efficiency. However, the exploration of enhancing inference efficiency during adaptation remains underexplored. This limits the broader application of pre-trained ViT models, especially when the model is computationally extensive. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Tuning (DyT), a novel approach to improve both parameter and inference efficiency for ViT adaptation. Specifically, besides using the lightweight adapter modules, we propose a token dispatcher to distinguish informative tokens from less important ones, allowing the latter to dynamically skip the original block, thereby reducing the redundant computation during inference. Additionally, we explore multiple design variants to find the best practice of DyT. Finally, inspired by the mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism, we introduce an enhanced adapter to further boost the adaptation performance. We validate DyT across various tasks, including image/video recognition and semantic segmentation. For instance, DyT achieves superior performance compared to existing PEFT methods while evoking only 71% of their FLOPs on the VTAB-1K benchmark."
Poster,DynaMITE-RL: A Dynamic Model for Improved Temporal Meta-Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95373,"Anthony Liang, Guy Tennenholtz, Chih-wei Hsu, Yinlam Chow, Erdem Bıyık, Craig Boutilier","We introduce DynaMITE-RL, a meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) approach to approximate inference in environments where the latent state evolves at varying rates. We model episode sessions---parts of the episode where the latent state is fixed---and propose three key modifications to existing meta-RL methods: (i) consistency of latent information within sessions, (ii) session masking, and (iii) prior latent conditioning. We demonstrate the importance of these modifications in various domains, ranging from discrete Gridworld environments to continuous-control and simulated robot assistive tasks, illustrating the efficacy of DynaMITE-RL over state-of-the-art baselines in both online and offline RL settings."
Poster,DynaMo: In-Domain Dynamics Pretraining for Visuo-Motor Control,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93200,"Zichen Cui, Hengkai Pan, Aadhithya Iyer, Siddhant Haldar, Lerrel Pinto","Imitation learning has proven to be a powerful tool for training complex visuo-motor policies. However, current methods often require hundreds to thousands of expert demonstrations to handle high-dimensional visual observations. A key reason for this poor data efficiency is that visual representations are predominantly either pretrained on out-of-domain data or trained directly through a behavior cloning objective. In this work, we present DynaMo, a new in-domain, self-supervised method for learning visual representations. Given a set of expert demonstrations, we jointly learn a latent inverse dynamics model and a forward dynamics model over a sequence of image embeddings, predicting the next frame in latent space, without augmentations, contrastive sampling, or access to ground truth actions. Importantly, DynaMo does not require any out-of-domain data such as Internet datasets or cross-embodied datasets. On a suite of six simulated and real environments, we show that representations learned with DynaMo significantly improve downstream imitation learning performance over prior self-supervised learning objectives, and pretrained representations. Gains from using DynaMo hold across policy classes such as Behavior Transformer, Diffusion Policy, MLP, and nearest neighbors. Finally, we ablate over key components of DynaMo and measure its impact on downstream policy performance. Robot videos are best viewed at https://dynamo-ssl.github.io."
Poster,E2E-MFD: Towards End-to-End Synchronous Multimodal Fusion Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96693,"Jiaqing Zhang, Mingxiang Cao, Weiying Xie, Jie Lei, Daixun Li, Wenbo Huang, Yunsong Li, Xue Yang","Multimodal image fusion and object detection are crucial for autonomous driving. While current methods have advanced the fusion of texture details and semantic information, their complex training processes hinder broader applications. Addressing this challenge, we introduce E2E-MFD, a novel end-to-end algorithm for multimodal fusion detection. E2E-MFD streamlines the process, achieving high performance with a single training phase. It employs synchronous joint optimization across components to avoid suboptimal solutions associated to individual tasks. Furthermore, it implements a comprehensive optimization strategy in the gradient matrix for shared parameters, ensuring convergence to an optimal fusion detection configuration. Our extensive testing on multiple public datasets reveals E2E-MFD's superior capabilities, showcasing not only visually appealing image fusion but also impressive detection outcomes, such as a 3.9\% and  2.0\% $\text{mAP}_{50}$ increase on horizontal object detection dataset M3FD and oriented object detection dataset DroneVehicle, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art approaches."
Poster,E2ENet: Dynamic Sparse Feature Fusion for Accurate and Efficient 3D Medical Image Segmentation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94743,"Boqian Wu, Qiao Xiao, Shiwei Liu, Lu Yin, Mykola Pechenizkiy, Decebal Constantin Mocanu, Maurice Keulen, Elena Mocanu","Deep neural networks have evolved as the leading approach in 3D medical image segmentation due to their outstanding performance. However, the ever-increasing model size and computational cost of deep neural networks have become the primary barriers to deploying them on real-world, resource-limited hardware. To achieve both segmentation accuracy and efficiency, we propose a 3D medical image segmentation model called Efficient to Efficient Network (E2ENet), which incorporates two parametrically and computationally efficient designs. i. Dynamic sparse feature fusion (DSFF) mechanism: it adaptively learns to fuse informative multi-scale features while reducing redundancy. ii. Restricted depth-shift in 3D convolution: it leverages the 3D spatial information while keeping the model and computational complexity as 2D-based methods. We conduct extensive experiments on AMOS, Brain Tumor Segmentation and BTCV Challenge, demonstrating that E2ENet consistently achieves a superior trade-off between accuracy and efficiency than prior arts across various resource constraints. %In particular, with a single model and single scale, E2ENet achieves comparable accuracy on the large-scale challenge AMOS-CT, while saving over 69% parameter count and 27% FLOPs in the inference phase, compared with the previousbest-performing method.

Poster,EAGLE: Efficient Adaptive Geometry-based Learning in Cross-view Understanding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96249,"Thanh-Dat Truong, Utsav Prabhu, Dongyi Wang, Bhiksha Raj, Susan Gauch, Jeyamkondan Subbiah, Khoa Luu","Unsupervised Domain Adaptation has been an efficient approach to transferring the semantic segmentation model across data distributions. Meanwhile, the recent Open-vocabulary Semantic Scene understanding based on large-scale vision language models is effective in open-set settings because it can learn diverse concepts and categories. However, these prior methods fail to generalize across different camera views due to the lack of cross-view geometric modeling. At present, there are limited studies analyzing cross-view learning. To address this problem, we introduce a novel Unsupervised Cross-view Adaptation Learning approach to modeling the geometric structural change across views in Semantic Scene Understanding. First, we introduce a novel Cross-view Geometric Constraint on Unpaired Data to model structural changes in images and segmentation masks across cameras. Second, we present a new Geodesic Flow-based Correlation Metric to efficiently measure the geometric structural changes across camera views. Third, we introduce a novel view-condition prompting mechanism to enhance the view-information modeling of the open-vocabulary segmentation network in cross-view adaptation learning. The experiments on different cross-view adaptation benchmarks have shown the effectiveness of our approach in cross-view modeling, demonstrating that we achieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance compared to prior unsupervised domain adaptation and open-vocabulary semantic segmentation methods."
