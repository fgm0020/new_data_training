Poster,Model Decides How to Tokenize: Adaptive DNA Sequence Tokenization with MxDNA,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96261,"Lifeng Qiao, Peng Ye, Yuchen Ren, Weiqiang Bai, Chaoqi Liang, Xinzhu Ma, Nanqing Dong, Wanli Ouyang","Foundation models have made significant strides in understanding the genomic language of DNA sequences. However, previous models typically adopt the tokenization methods designed for natural language, which are unsuitable for DNA sequences due to their unique characteristics. In addition, the optimal approach to tokenize DNA remains largely under-explored, and may not be intuitively understood by humans even if discovered. To address these challenges, we introduce MxDNA, a novel framework where the model autonomously learns an effective DNA tokenization strategy through gradient decent. MxDNA employs a sparse Mixture of Convolution Experts coupled with a deformable convolution to model the tokenization process, with the discontinuous, overlapping, and ambiguous nature of meaningful genomic segments explicitly considered. On Nucleotide Transformer Benchmarks and Genomic Benchmarks, MxDNA demonstrates superior performance to existing methods with less pretraining data and time, highlighting its effectiveness. Finally, we show that MxDNA learns unique tokenization strategy distinct to those of previous methods and captures genomic functionalities at a token level during self-supervised pretraining. Our MxDNA aims to provide a new perspective on DNA tokenization, potentially offering broad applications in various domains and yielding profound insights.

Poster,Model-free Low-Rank Reinforcement Learning via Leveraged Entry-wise Matrix Estimation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95824,"Stefan Stojanovic, Yassir Jedra, Alexandre Proutiere","We consider the problem of learning an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in controlled dynamical systems with low-rank latent structure. For this problem, we present LoRa-PI (Low-Rank Policy Iteration), a model-free learning algorithm alternating between policy improvement and policy evaluation steps. In the latter, the algorithm estimates the low-rank matrix corresponding to the (state, action) value function of the current policy using the following two-phase procedure. The entries of the matrix are first sampled uniformly at random to estimate, via a spectral method, the *leverage scores* of its rows and columns. These scores are then used to extract a few important rows and columns whose entries are further sampled. The algorithm exploits these new samples to  complete the matrix estimation using a CUR-like method. For this leveraged matrix estimation procedure, we establish entry-wise guarantees that remarkably, do not depend on the coherence of the matrix but only on its spikiness. These guarantees imply that LoRa-PI learns an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy using $\tilde{\cal O}({(S+A)\over \mathrm{poly}(1-\gamma)\varepsilon^2})$ samples where $S$ (resp. $A$) denotes the number of states (resp. actions) and $\gamma$ the discount factor. Our algorithm achieves this order-optimal (in $S$, $A$ and $\varepsilon$) sample complexity under milder conditions than those assumed in previously proposed approaches."
Poster,Model Fusion through Bayesian Optimization in Language Model Fine-Tuning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93827,"Chaeyun Jang, Hyungi Lee, Jungtaek Kim, Juho Lee","Fine-tuning pre-trained models for downstream tasks is a widely adopted technique known for its adaptability and reliability across various domains. Despite its conceptual simplicity, fine-tuning entails several troublesome engineering choices, such as selecting hyperparameters and determining checkpoints from an optimization trajectory. To tackle the difficulty of choosing the best model, one effective solution is model fusion, which combines multiple models in a parameter space. However, we observe a large discrepancy between loss and metric landscapes during the fine-tuning of pre-trained language models. Building on this observation, we introduce a novel model fusion technique that optimizes both the desired metric and loss through multi-objective Bayesian optimization. In addition, to effectively select hyperparameters, we establish a two-stage procedure by integrating Bayesian optimization processes into our framework. Experiments across various downstream tasks show considerable performance improvements using our Bayesian optimization-guided method."
Poster,Modeling Latent Neural Dynamics with Gaussian Process Switching Linear Dynamical Systems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95587,"Amber Hu, David Zoltowski, Aditya Nair, David Anderson, Lea Duncker, Scott Linderman","Understanding how the collective activity of neural populations relates to computation and ultimately behavior is a key goal in neuroscience. To this end, statistical methods which describe high-dimensional neural time series in terms of low-dimensional latent dynamics have played a fundamental role in characterizing neural systems. Yet, what constitutes a successful method involves two opposing criteria: (1) methods should be expressive enough to capture complex nonlinear dynamics, and (2) they should maintain a notion of interpretability often only warranted by simpler linear models. In this paper, we develop an approach that balances these two objectives: the Gaussian Process Switching Linear Dynamical System (gpSLDS). Our method builds on previous work modeling the latent state evolution via a stochastic differential equation whose nonlinear dynamics are described by a Gaussian process (GP-SDEs). We propose a novel kernel function which enforces smoothly interpolated locally linear dynamics, and therefore expresses flexible -- yet interpretable -- dynamics akin to those of recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS). Our approach resolves key limitations of the rSLDS such as artifactual oscillations in dynamics near discrete state boundaries, while also providing posterior uncertainty estimates of the dynamics. To fit our models, we leverage a modified learning objective which improves the estimation accuracy of kernel hyperparameters compared to previous GP-SDE fitting approaches. We apply our method to synthetic data and data recorded in two neuroscience experiments and demonstrate favorable performance in comparison to the rSLDS."
Poster,Model LEGO: Creating Models Like Disassembling and Assembling Building Blocks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93649,"Jiacong Hu, Jing Gao, Jingwen Ye, Yang Gao, Xingen Wang, Zunlei Feng, Mingli Song","With the rapid development of deep learning, the increasing complexity and scale of parameters make training a new model increasingly resource-intensive. In this paper, we start from the classic convolutional neural network (CNN) and explore a paradigm that does not require training to obtain new models. Similar to the birth of CNN inspired by receptive fields in the biological visual system, we draw inspiration from the information subsystem pathways in the biological visual system and propose Model Disassembling and Assembling (MDA). During model disassembling, we introduce the concept of relative contribution and propose a component locating technique to extract task-aware components from trained CNN classifiers. For model assembling, we present the alignment padding strategy and parameter scaling strategy to construct a new model tailored for a specific task, utilizing the disassembled task-aware components.The entire process is akin to playing with LEGO bricks, enabling arbitrary assembly of new models, and providing a novel perspective for model creation and reuse. Extensive experiments showcase that task-aware components disassembled from CNN classifiers or new models assembled using these components closely match or even surpass the performance of the baseline,demonstrating its promising results for model reuse. Furthermore, MDA exhibits diverse potential applications, with comprehensive experiments exploring model decision route analysis, model compression, knowledge distillation, and more."
Poster,Model Reconstruction Using Counterfactual Explanations: A Perspective From Polytope Theory,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96291,"Pasan Dissanayake, Sanghamitra Dutta","Counterfactual explanations provide ways of achieving a favorable model outcome with minimum input perturbation. However, counterfactual explanations can also be leveraged to reconstruct the model by strategically training a surrogate model to give similar predictions as the original (target) model. In this work, we analyze how model reconstruction using counterfactuals can be improved byfurther leveraging the fact that the counterfactuals also lie quite close to the decision boundary. Our main contribution is to derive novel theoretical relationships between the error in model reconstruction and the number of counterfactual queries required using polytope theory. Our theoretical analysis leads us to propose a strategy for model reconstruction that we call Counterfactual Clamping Attack (CCA) which trains a surrogate model using a unique loss function that treats counterfactuals differently than ordinary instances. Our approach also alleviates the related problem of decision boundary shift that arises in existing model reconstruction approaches when counterfactuals are treated as ordinary instances. Experimental results demonstrate that our strategy improves fidelity between the target and surrogate model predictions on several datasets."
Poster,Model Sensitivity Aware Continual Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96214,"Zhenyi Wang, Heng Huang","Continual learning (CL) aims to adapt to non-stationary data distributions while retaining previously acquired knowledge. However, CL models typically face a trade-off between preserving old task knowledge and excelling in new task performance. Existing approaches often sacrifice one for the other. To overcome this limitation, orthogonal to existing approaches, we propose a novel perspective that views the CL model ability in preserving old knowledge and performing well in new task as a matter of model sensitivity to parameter updates. \textit{Excessive} parameter sensitivity can lead to two drawbacks: (1) significant forgetting of previous knowledge; and (2) overfitting to new tasks. To reduce parameter sensitivity, we optimize the model's performance based on the parameter distribution, which achieves the worst-case CL performance within a distribution neighborhood. This innovative learning paradigm offers dual benefits: (1) reduced forgetting of old knowledge by mitigating drastic changes in model predictions under small parameter updates; and (2) enhanced new task performance by preventing overfitting to new tasks. Consequently, our method achieves superior ability in retaining old knowledge and achieving excellent new task performance simultaneously.Importantly, our approach is compatible with existing CL methodologies, allowing seamless integration while delivering significant improvements in effectiveness, efficiency, and versatility with both theoretical and empirical supports."
Poster,MoE Jetpack: From Dense Checkpoints to Adaptive Mixture of Experts for Vision Tasks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95262,"Xingkui Zhu, Yiran Guan, Dingkang Liang, Yuchao Chen, Yuliang Liu, Xiang Bai","The sparsely activated mixture of experts (MoE) model presents an effective alternative to densely activated (dense) models, combining improved accuracy with computational efficiency. However, training MoE models from scratch requires extensive data and computational resources, a challenge that limits their widespread adoption. To address this, we introduce MoE Jetpack, a framework designed to fine-tune the abundant and easily accessible dense checkpoints into MoE models. MoE Jetpack incorporates two key techniques: (1) **checkpoint recycling**, which initializes MoE models with dense checkpoints to accelerate convergence and enhance accuracy, minimizing the need for extensive pre-training; (2) the **hyperspherical adaptive MoE (SpheroMoE) layer**, which optimizes the MoE architecture to enhance fine-tuning performance and efficiency.Experimental results indicate that MoE Jetpack doubles the convergence speed and enhances accuracy by 2.8% on ImageNet-1K. On smaller datasets, it achieves up to 8-fold faster convergence and over 30% accuracy gains, highlighting its efficiency.The code is available at https://github.com/Adlith/MoE-Jetpack."
Poster,MoEUT: Mixture-of-Experts Universal Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94601,"Robert Csordas, Kazuki Irie, Jürgen Schmidhuber, Christopher Potts, Christopher D Manning","Previous work on Universal Transformers (UTs) has demonstrated the importance of parameter sharing across layers. By allowing recurrence in depth, UTs have advantages over standard Transformers in learning compositional generalizations, but layer-sharing comes with a practical limitation of parameter-compute ratio: it drastically reduces the parameter count compared to the non-shared model with the same dimensionality. Naively scaling up the layer size to compensate for the loss of parameters makes its computational resource requirements prohibitive. In practice, no previous work has succeeded in proposing a shared-layer Transformer design that is competitive in parameter count-dominated tasks such as language modeling. Here we propose MoEUT (pronounced ""moot""), an effective mixture-of-experts (MoE)-based shared-layer Transformer architecture, which combines several recent advances in MoEs for both feedforward and attention layers of standard Transformers together with novel layer-normalization and grouping schemes that are specific and crucial to UTs. The resulting UT model, for the first time, slightly outperforms standard Transformers on language modeling tasks such as BLiMP and PIQA, while using significantly less compute and memory."
Poster,MoGenTS: Motion Generation based on Spatial-Temporal Joint Modeling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95951,"Weihao Yuan, Yisheng HE, Weichao Shen, Yuan Dong, Xiaodong Gu, Zilong Dong, Liefeng Bo, Qixing Huang","Motion generation from discrete quantization offers many advantages over continuous regression, but at the cost of inevitable approximation errors. Previous methods usually quantize the entire body pose into one code, which not only faces the difficulty in encoding all joints within one vector but also loses the spatial relationship between different joints. Differently, in this work we quantize each individual joint into one vector, which i) simplifies the quantization process as the complexity associated with a single joint is markedly lower than that of the entire pose; ii) maintains a spatial-temporal structure that preserves both the spatial relationships among joints and the temporal movement patterns; iii) yields a 2D token map, which enables the application of various 2D operations widely used in 2D images. Grounded in the 2D motion quantization, we build a spatial-temporal modeling framework, where 2D joint VQVAE, temporal-spatial 2D masking technique, and spatial-temporal 2D attention are proposed to take advantage of spatial-temporal signals among the 2D tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous methods across different datasets, with a $26.6\%$ decrease of FID on HumanML3D and a $29.9\%$ decrease on KIT-ML."
