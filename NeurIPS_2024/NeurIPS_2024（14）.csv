Poster,Adaptive Preference Scaling for Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95876,"Ilgee Hong, Zichong Li, Alexander Bukharin, Yixiao Li, Haoming Jiang, Tianbao Yang, Tuo Zhao","Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a prevalent approach to align AI systems with human values by learning rewards from human preference data. Due to various reasons, however, such data typically takes the form of rankings over pairs of trajectory segments, which fails to capture the varying strengths of preferences across different pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive preference loss, underpinned by distributionally robust optimization (DRO), designed to address this uncertainty in preference strength. By incorporating an adaptive scaling parameter into the loss for each pair, our method increases the flexibility of the reward function. Specifically, it assigns small scaling parameters to pairs with ambiguous preferences, leading to more comparable rewards, and large scaling parameters to those with clear preferences for more distinct rewards. Computationally, our proposed loss function is strictly convex and univariate with respect to each scaling parameter, enabling its efficient optimization through a simple second-order algorithm. Our method is versatile and can be readily adapted to various preference optimization frameworks, including direct preference optimization (DPO). Our experiments with robotic control and natural language generation with large language models (LLMs) show that our method not only improves policy performance but also aligns reward function selection more closely with policy optimization, simplifying the hyperparameter tuning process."
Poster,Adaptive Proximal Gradient Method for Convex Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93476,"Yura Malitsky, Konstantin Mishchenko","In this paper, we explore two fundamental first-order algorithms in convex optimization, namely, gradient descent (GD) and proximal gradient method (ProxGD). Our focus is on making these algorithms entirely adaptive by leveraging local curvature information of smooth functions. We propose adaptive versions of GD and ProxGD that are based on observed gradient differences and, thus, have no added computational costs. Moreover, we prove convergence of our methods assuming only local Lipschitzness of the gradient. In addition, the proposed versions allow for even larger stepsizes than those initially suggested in [MM20]."
Poster,Adaptive Randomized Smoothing: Certified Adversarial Robustness for Multi-Step Defences,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95529,"Saiyue Lyu, Shadab Shaikh, Frederick Shpilevskiy, Evan Shelhamer, Mathias Lécuyer","We propose Adaptive Randomized Smoothing (ARS) to certify the predictions of our test-time adaptive models against adversarial examples.ARS extends the analysis of randomized smoothing using $f$-Differential Privacy to certify the adaptive composition of multiple steps.For the first time, our theory covers the sound adaptive composition of general and high-dimensional functions of noisy inputs.We instantiate ARS on deep image classification to certify predictions against adversarial examples of bounded $L_{\infty}$ norm.In the $L_{\infty}$ threat model, ARS enables flexible adaptation through high-dimensional input-dependent masking.We design adaptivity benchmarks, based on CIFAR-10 and CelebA, and show that ARS improves standard test accuracy by  1 to 15\% points.On ImageNet, ARS improves certified test accuracy by up to 1.6% points over standard RS without adaptivity.

Poster,Adaptive Sampling for Efficient Softmax Approximation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94739,"Tavor Baharav, Ryan Kang, Colin Sullivan, Mo Tiwari, Eric Luxenberg, David Tse, Mert Pilanci","The softmax function is ubiquitous in machine learning and optimization applications. Computing the full softmax evaluation of a matrix-vector product can be computationally expensive in high-dimensional settings. In many applications, however, it is sufficient to calculate only the top few outputs of the softmax function. In this work, we present an algorithm, dubbed AdaptiveSoftmax, that adaptively computes the top k softmax values more efficiently than the full softmax computation, with probabilistic guarantees. We demonstrate the sample efficiency improvements afforded by AdaptiveSoftmax on real and synthetic data to corroborate our theoretical results. AdaptiveSoftmax yields >10x gain over full softmax computation on most datasets, yielding up to 30x improvement for Mistral7B evaluated on the Wikitext dataset. The adaptive method we propose for estimating the partition function (the softmax denominator) is of independent interest and can be used in other applications such as kernel density estimation."
Poster,Adaptive Variance Reduction for Stochastic Optimization under Weaker Assumptions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93314,"Wei Jiang, Sifan Yang, Yibo Wang, Lijun Zhang","This paper explores adaptive variance reduction methods for stochastic optimization based on the STORM technique. Existing adaptive extensions of STORM rely on strong assumptions like bounded gradients and bounded function values, or suffer an additional $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ term in the convergence rate. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel adaptive STORM method that achieves an optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/3})$ for non-convex functions with our newly designed learning rate strategy. Compared with existing approaches, our method requires weaker assumptions and attains the optimal convergence rate without the additional $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ term. We also extend the proposed technique to stochastic compositional optimization, obtaining the same optimal rate of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/3})$. Furthermore, we investigate the non-convex finite-sum problem and develop another innovative adaptive variance reduction method that achieves an optimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(n^{1/4} T^{-1/2} )$, where $n$ represents the number of component functions. Numerical experiments across various tasks validate the effectiveness of our method."
Poster,Adaptive Visual Scene Understanding: Incremental Scene Graph Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96501,"Naitik Khandelwal, Xiao Liu, Mengmi Zhang","Scene graph generation (SGG) analyzes images to extract meaningful information about objects and their relationships. In the dynamic visual world, it is crucial for AI systems to continuously detect new objects and establish their relationships with existing ones. Recently, numerous studies have focused on continual learning within the domains of object detection and image recognition. However, a limited amount of research focuses on a more challenging continual learning problem in SGG. This increased difficulty arises from the intricate interactions and dynamic relationships among objects, and their associated contexts. Thus, in continual learning, SGG models are often required to expand, modify, retain, and reason scene graphs within the process of adaptive visual scene understanding. To systematically explore Continual Scene Graph Generation (CSEGG), we present a comprehensive benchmark comprising three learning regimes: relationship incremental, scene incremental, and relationship generalization. Moreover, we introduce a ``Replays via Analysis by Synthesis"" method named RAS. This approach leverages the scene graphs, decomposes and re-composes them to represent different scenes, and replays the synthesized scenes based on these compositional scene graphs. The replayed synthesized scenes act as a means to practice and refine proficiency in SGG in known and unknown environments. Our experimental results not only highlight the challenges of directly combining existing continual learning methods with SGG backbones but also demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, enhancing CSEGG efficiency while simultaneously preserving privacy and memory usage. All data and source code will be made public."
Poster,AdaSociety: An Adaptive Environment with Social Structures for Multi-Agent Decision-Making,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97511,"Yizhe Huang, Xingbo Wang, Hao Liu, Fanqi Kong, Aoyang Qin, Min Tang, Xiaoxi Wang, Song-Chun Zhu, Mingjie Bi, Siyuan Qi, Xue Feng","Traditional interactive environments limit agents' intelligence growth with fixed tasks. Recently, single-agent environments address this by generating new tasks based on agent actions, enhancing task diversity. We consider the decision-making problem in multi-agent settings, where tasks are further influenced by social connections, affecting rewards and information access. However, existing multi-agent environments lack a combination of adaptive physical surroundings and social connections, hindering the learning of intelligent behaviors.To address this, we introduce AdaSociety, a customizable multi-agent environment featuring expanding state and action spaces, alongside explicit and alterable social structures.  As agents progress, the environment adaptively generates new tasks with social structures for agents to undertake. In AdaSociety, we develop three mini-games showcasing distinct social structures and tasks. Initial results demonstrate that specific social structures can promote both individual and collective benefits, though current reinforcement learning and LLM-based algorithms show limited effectiveness in leveraging social structures to enhance performance. Overall, AdaSociety serves as a valuable research platform for exploring intelligence in diverse physical and social settings. The code is available at https://github.com/bigai-ai/AdaSociety."
Poster,A Data-Centric Perspective on Evaluating Machine Learning Models for Tabular Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97534,"Andrej Tschalzev, Sascha Marton, Stefan Lüdtke, Christian Bartelt, Heiner Stuckenschmidt","Tabular data is prevalent in real-world machine learning applications, and new models for supervised learning of tabular data are frequently proposed. Comparative studies assessing performance differences typically have model-centered evaluation setups with overly standardized data preprocessing. This limits the external validity of these studies, as in real-world modeling pipelines, models are typically applied after dataset-specific preprocessing and feature engineering. We address this gap by proposing a data-centric evaluation framework. We select 10 relevant datasets from Kaggle competitions and implement expert-level preprocessing pipelines for each dataset. We conduct experiments with different preprocessing pipelines and hyperparameter optimization (HPO) regimes to quantify the impact of model selection, HPO, feature engineering, and test-time adaptation. Our main findings reveal: 1) After dataset-specific feature engineering, model rankings change considerably, performance differences decrease, and the importance of model selection reduces. 2) Recent models, despite their measurable progress, still significantly benefit from manual feature engineering. This holds true for both tree-based models and neural networks. 3) While tabular data is typically considered static, samples are often collected over time, and adapting to distribution shifts can be important even in supposedly static data. These insights suggest that research efforts should be directed toward a data-centric perspective, acknowledging that tabular data requires feature engineering and often exhibits temporal characteristics."
Poster,Ad Auctions for LLMs via Retrieval Augmented Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94948,"MohammadTaghi Hajiaghayi, Sébastien Lahaie, Keivan Rezaei, Suho Shin","In the field of computational advertising, the integration of ads into the outputs of large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to support these services without compromising content integrity. This paper introduces novel auction mechanisms for ad allocation and pricing within the textual outputs of LLMs, leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We propose a \emph{segment auction} where an ad is probabilistically retrieved for each discourse segment (paragraph, section, or entire output) according to its bid and relevance, following the RAG framework, and priced according to competing bids. We show that our auction maximizes logarithmic social welfare, a new notion of welfare that balances allocation efficiency and fairness, and we characterize the associated incentive-compatible pricing rule. These results are extended to multi-ad allocation per segment. An empirical evaluation validates the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach over several ad auction scenarios, and exhibits inherent tradeoffs in metrics as we allow the LLM more flexibility to allocate ads."
Poster,Addressing Asynchronicity in Clinical Multimodal Fusion via Individualized Chest X-ray Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93285,"Wenfang Yao, Chen Liu, Kejing Yin, William Cheung, Jing Qin","Integrating multi-modal clinical data, such as electronic health records (EHR) and chest X-ray images (CXR), is particularly beneficial for clinical prediction tasks. However, in a temporal setting, multi-modal data are often inherently asynchronous. EHR can be continuously collected but CXR is generally taken with a much longer interval due to its high cost and radiation dose. When clinical prediction is needed, the last available CXR image might have been outdated, leading to suboptimal predictions. To address this challenge, we propose DDL-CXR, a method that dynamically generates an up-to-date latent representation of the individualized CXR images. Our approach leverages latent diffusion models for patient-specific generation strategically conditioned on a previous CXR image and EHR time series, providing information regarding anatomical structures and disease progressions, respectively. In this way, the interaction across modalities could be better captured by the latent CXR generation process, ultimately improving the prediction performance. Experiments using MIMIC datasets show that the proposed model could effectively address asynchronicity in multimodal fusion and consistently outperform existing methods."
