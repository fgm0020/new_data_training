Poster,Fight Back Against Jailbreaking via Prompt Adversarial Tuning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93692,"Yichuan Mo, Yuji Wang, Zeming Wei, Yisen Wang","While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved tremendous success in various applications, they are also susceptible to jailbreaking attacks. Several primary defense strategies have been proposed to protect LLMs from producing harmful information, mostly focusing on model fine-tuning or heuristical defense designs. However, how to achieve intrinsic robustness through prompt optimization remains an open problem. In this paper, motivated by adversarial training paradigms for achieving reliable robustness, we propose an approach named **Prompt Adversarial Tuning (PAT)** that trains a prompt control attached to the user prompt as a guard prefix. To achieve our defense goal whilst maintaining natural performance, we optimize the control prompt with both adversarial and benign prompts. Comprehensive experiments show that our method is effective against both grey-box and black-box attacks, reducing the success rate of advanced attacks to nearly 0, while maintaining the model's utility on the benign task and incurring only negligible computational overhead, charting a new perspective for future explorations in LLM security.

Poster,FilterNet: Harnessing Frequency Filters for Time Series Forecasting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93257,"Kun Yi, Jingru Fei, Qi Zhang, Hui He, Shufeng Hao, Defu Lian, Wei Fan","Given the ubiquitous presence of time series data across various domains, precise forecasting of time series holds significant importance and finds widespread real-world applications such as energy, weather, healthcare, etc. While numerous forecasters have been proposed using different network architectures, the Transformer-based models have state-of-the-art performance in time series forecasting. However, forecasters based on Transformers are still suffering from vulnerability to high-frequency signals, efficiency in computation, and bottleneck in full-spectrum utilization, which essentially are the cornerstones for accurately predicting time series with thousands of points. In this paper, we explore a novel perspective of enlightening signal processing for deep time series forecasting. Inspired by the filtering process, we introduce one simple yet effective network, namely FilterNet, built upon our proposed learnable frequency filters to extract key informative temporal patterns by selectively passing or attenuating certain components of time series signals. Concretely, we propose two kinds of learnable filters in the FilterNet: (i) Plain shaping filter, that adopts a universal frequency kernel for signal filtering and temporal modeling; (ii) Contextual shaping filter, that utilizes filtered frequencies examined in terms of its compatibility with input signals fordependency learning. Equipped with the two filters, FilterNet can approximately surrogate the linear and attention mappings widely adopted in time series literature, while enjoying superb abilities in handling high-frequency noises and utilizing the whole frequency spectrum that is beneficial for forecasting. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on eight time series forecasting benchmarks, and experimental results have demonstrated our superior performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency compared with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at$^1$."
Poster,FINALLY: fast and universal speech enhancement with studio-like quality,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96882,"Nicholas Babaev, Kirill Tamogashev, Azat Saginbaev, Ivan Shchekotov, Hanbin Bae, Hosang Sung, WonJun Lee, Hoon-Young Cho, Pavel Andreev","In this paper, we address the challenge of speech enhancement in real-world recordings, which often contain various forms of distortion, such as background noise, reverberation, and microphone artifacts.We revisit the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for speech enhancement and theoretically show that GANs are naturally inclined to seek the point of maximum density within the conditional clean speech distribution, which, as we argue, is essential for speech enhancement task.We study various feature extractors for perceptual loss to facilitate the stability of adversarial training, developing a methodology for probing the structure of the feature space.This leads us to integrate WavLM-based perceptual loss into MS-STFT adversarial training pipeline, creating an effective and stable training procedure for the speech enhancement model.The resulting speech enhancement model, which we refer to as FINALLY, builds upon the HiFi++ architecture, augmented with a WavLM encoder and a novel training pipeline.Empirical results on various datasets confirm our model's ability to produce clear, high-quality speech at 48 kHz, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of speech enhancement.

Poster,FinBen: A Holistic Financial Benchmark for Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97525,"Qianqian Xie, Weiguang Han, Zhengyu Chen, Ruoyu Xiang, Xiao Zhang, Yueru He, Mengxi Xiao, Dong Li, Yongfu Dai, Duanyu Feng, Yijing Xu, Haoqiang Kang, Ziyan Kuang, Chenhan Yuan, Kailai Yang, Zheheng Luo, Tianlin Zhang, Zhiwei Liu, GUOJUN XIONG, Zhiyang Deng, Yuechen Jiang, Zhiyuan Yao, Haohang Li, Yangyang Yu, Gang Hu, Huang Jiajia, Xiaoyang Liu, Alejandro Lopez-Lira, Benyou Wang, Yanzhao Lai, Hao Wang, Min Peng, Sophia Ananiadou, Jimin Huang","LLMs have transformed NLP and shown promise in various fields, yet their potential in finance is underexplored due to a lack of comprehensive benchmarks, the rapid development of LLMs, and the complexity of financial tasks. In this paper, we introduce FinBen, the first extensive open-source evaluation benchmark, including 42 datasets spanning 24 financial tasks, covering eight critical aspects: information extraction (IE), textual analysis, question answering (QA), text generation, risk management, forecasting, decision-making, and bilingual (English and Spanish). FinBen offers several key innovations: a broader range of tasks and datasets, the first evaluation of stock trading, novel agent and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evaluation, and two novel datasets for regulations and stock trading. Our evaluation of 21 representative LLMs, including GPT-4, ChatGPT, and the latest Gemini, reveals several key findings: While LLMs excel in IE and textual analysis, they struggle with advanced reasoning and complex tasks like text generation and forecasting. GPT-4 excels in IE and stock trading, while Gemini is better at text generation and forecasting. Instruction-tuned LLMs improve textual analysis but offer limited benefits for complex tasks such as QA. FinBen has been used to host the first financial LLMs shared task at the FinNLP-AgentScen workshop during IJCAI-2024, attracting 12 teams. Their novel solutions outperformed GPT-4, showcasing FinBen's potential to drive innovations in financial LLMs. All datasets and code are publicly available for the research community, with results shared and updated regularly on the Open Financial LLM Leaderboard."
Poster,FinCon: A Synthesized LLM Multi-Agent System with Conceptual Verbal Reinforcement for Enhanced Financial Decision Making,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94352,"Yangyang Yu, Zhiyuan Yao, Haohang Li, Zhiyang Deng, Yuechen Jiang, Yupeng Cao, Zhi Chen, Jordan Suchow, Zhenyu Cui, Rong Liu, Zhaozhuo Xu, Denghui Zhang, Koduvayur (Suba) Subbalakshmi, GUOJUN XIONG, Yueru He, Jimin Huang, Dong Li, Qianqian Xie","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable potential in conducting complex tasks and are increasingly utilized in various financial applications. However, high-quality sequential financial investment decision-making remains challenging. These tasks require multiple interactions with a volatile environment for every decision, demanding sufficient intelligence to maximize returns and manage risks. Although LLMs have been used to develop agent systems that surpass human teams and yield impressive investment returns, opportunities to enhance multi-source information synthesis and optimize decision-making outcomes through timely experience refinement remain unexplored. Here, we introduce FinCon, an LLM-based multi-agent framework tailored for diverse financial tasks. Inspired by effective real-world investment firm organizational structures, FinCon utilizes a manager-analyst communication hierarchy. This structure allows for synchronized cross-functional agent collaboration towards unified goals through natural language interactions and equips each agent with greater memory capacity than humans. Additionally, a risk-control component in FinCon enhances decision quality by episodically initiating a self-critiquing mechanism to update systematic investment beliefs. The conceptualized beliefs serve as verbal reinforcement for the future agent’s behavior and can be selectively propagated to the appropriate node that requires knowledge updates. This feature significantly improves performance while reducing unnecessary peer-to-peer communication costs. Moreover, FinCon demonstrates strong generalization capabilities in various financial tasks, including stock trading and portfolio management."
Poster,FindingEmo: An Image Dataset for Emotion Recognition in the Wild,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97871,"Laurent Mertens, Elahe Yargholi, Hans Op de Beeck, Jan Van den Stock, Joost Vennekens","We introduce FindingEmo, a new image dataset containing annotations for 25k images, specifically tailored to Emotion Recognition. Contrary to existing datasets, it focuses on complex scenes depicting multiple people in various naturalistic, social settings, with images being annotated as a whole, thereby going beyond the traditional focus on faces or single individuals. Annotated dimensions include Valence, Arousal and Emotion label, with annotations gathered using Prolific. Together with the annotations, we release the list of URLs pointing to the original images, as well as all associated source code."
Poster,Finding good policies in average-reward Markov Decision Processes without prior knowledge,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95839,"Adrienne Tuynman, Rémy Degenne, Emilie Kaufmann","We revisit the identification of an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDP). In such MDPs, two measures of complexity have appeared in the literature: the diameter, $D$, and the optimal bias span, $H$, which satisfy $H\leq D$.  Prior work have studied the complexity of $\varepsilon$-optimal policy identification only when a generative model is available. In this case, it is known that there exists an MDP with $D \simeq H$ for which the sample complexity to output an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy is $\Omega(SAD/\varepsilon^2)$ where $S$ and $A$ are the sizes of the state and action spaces. Recently, an algorithm with a sample complexity of order $SAH/\varepsilon^2$ has been proposed, but it requires the knowledge of $H$. We first show that the sample complexity required to estimate $H$ is not bounded by any function of $S,A$ and $H$, ruling out the possibility to easily make the previous algorithm agnostic to $H$. By relying instead on a diameter estimation procedure, we propose the first algorithm for $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-PAC policy identification that does not need any form of prior knowledge on the MDP. Its sample complexity scales in $SAD/\varepsilon^2$ in the regime of small $\varepsilon$, which is near-optimal. In the online setting, our first contribution is a lower bound which implies that a sample complexity polynomial in $H$ cannot be achieved in this setting. Then, we propose an online algorithm with a sample complexity in $SAD^2/\varepsilon^2$, as well as a novel approach based on a data-dependent stopping rule that we believe is promising to further reduce this bound."
Poster,Finding NeMo: Localizing Neurons Responsible For Memorization in Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94713,"Dominik Hintersdorf, Lukas Struppek, Kristian Kersting, Adam Dziedzic, Franziska Boenisch","Diffusion models (DMs) produce very detailed and high-quality images. Their power results from extensive training on large amounts of data - usually scraped from the internet without proper attribution or consent from content creators.  Unfortunately, this practice raises privacy and intellectual property concerns, as DMs can memorize and later reproduce their potentially sensitive or copyrighted training images at inference time. Prior efforts prevent this issue by either changing the input to the diffusion process, thereby preventing the DM from generating memorized samples during inference, or removing the memorized data from training altogether. While those are viable solutions when the DM is developed and deployed in a secure and constantly monitored environment, they hold the risk of adversaries circumventing the safeguards and are not effective when the DM itself is publicly released. To solve the problem, we introduce NeMo, the first method to localize memorization of individual data samples down to the level of neurons in DMs' cross-attention layers. Through our experiments, we make the intriguing finding that in many cases, single neurons are responsible for memorizing particular training samples. By deactivating these memorization neurons, we can avoid the replication of training data at inference time, increase the diversity in the generated outputs, and mitigate the leakage of private and copyrighted data. In this way, our NeMo contributes to a more responsible deployment of DMs."
Poster,Finding Transformer Circuits With Edge Pruning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96350,"Adithya Bhaskar, Alexander Wettig, Dan Friedman, Danqi Chen","The path to interpreting a language model often proceeds via analysis of circuits---sparse computational subgraphs of the model that capture specific aspects of its behavior. Recent work has automated the task of discovering circuits. Yet, these methods have practical limitations, as they either rely on inefficient search algorithms or inaccurate approximations. In this paper, we frame circuit discovery as an optimization problem and propose _Edge Pruning_ as an effective and scalable solution. Edge Pruning leverages gradient-based pruning techniques, but instead of removing neurons or components, prunes the _edges_ between components. Our method finds circuits in GPT-2 that use less than half the number of edges than circuits found by previous methods while being equally faithful to the full model predictions on standard circuit-finding tasks. Edge Pruning is efficient on tasks involving up to 100,000 examples, outperforming previous methods in speed and producing substantially better circuits. It also perfectly recovers the ground-truth circuits in two models compiled with Tracr. Thanks to its efficiency, we scale Edge Pruning to CodeLlama-13B, a model over 100x the size of GPT-2.We use this setting for a case study, where we compare the mechanisms behind instruction prompting and in-context learning.We find two circuits with more than 99.96% sparsity that match the performance of the full model. Further analysis reveals that the mechanisms in the two settings overlap substantially. This shows that Edge Pruning is a practical and scalable tool for interpretability, which can shed light on behaviors that only emerge in large models."
Poster,FineCLIP: Self-distilled Region-based CLIP for Better Fine-grained Understanding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93703,"Dong Jing, Xiaolong He, Yutian Luo, Nanyi Fei, guoxing Yang, Wei Wei, Huiwen Zhao, Zhiwu Lu","Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) achieves impressive performance on tasks like image classification and image-text retrieval by learning on large-scale image-text datasets. However, CLIP struggles with dense prediction tasks due to the poor grasp of the fine-grained details. Although existing works pay attention to this issue, they achieve limited improvements and usually sacrifice the important visual-semantic consistency. To overcome these limitations, we propose FineCLIP, which keeps the global contrastive learning to preserve the visual-semantic consistency and further enhances the fine-grained understanding through two innovations: 1) A real-time self-distillation scheme that facilitates the transfer of representation capability from global to local features. 2) A semantically-rich regional contrastive learning paradigm with generated region-text pairs, boosting the local representation capabilities with abundant fine-grained knowledge. Both cooperate to fully leverage diverse semantics and multi-grained complementary information.To validate the superiority of our FineCLIP and the rationality of each design, we conduct extensive experiments on challenging dense prediction and image-level tasks. All the observations demonstrate the effectiveness of FineCLIP."
