Poster,Unsupervised Homography Estimation on Multimodal Image Pair via Alternating Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/92937,"Sanghyeob Song, Jaihyun Lew, Hyemi Jang, Sungroh Yoon","Estimating the homography between two images is crucial for mid- or high-level vision tasks, such as image stitching and fusion. However, using supervised learning methods is often challenging or costly due to the difficulty of collecting ground-truth data. In response, unsupervised learning approaches have emerged. Most early methods, though, assume that the given image pairs are from the same camera or have minor lighting differences. Consequently, while these methods perform effectively under such conditions, they generally fail when input image pairs come from different domains, referred to as multimodal image pairs.To address these limitations, we propose AltO, an unsupervised learning framework for estimating homography in multimodal image pairs. Our method employs a two-phase alternating optimization framework, similar to Expectation-Maximization (EM), where one phase reduces the geometry gap and the other addresses the modality gap. To handle these gaps, we use Barlow Twins loss for the modality gap and propose an extended version, Geometry Barlow Twins, for the geometry gap. As a result, we demonstrate that our method, AltO, can be trained on multimodal datasets without any ground-truth data. It not only outperforms other unsupervised methods but is also compatible with various architectures of homography estimators.The source code can be found at: https://github.com/songsang7/AltO"
Poster,Unsupervised Modality Adaptation with Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Semantic Segmentation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96606,"Ruihao Xia, Yu Liang, Peng-Tao Jiang, Hao Zhang, Bo Li, Yang Tang, Pan Zhou","Despite their success, unsupervised domain adaptation methods for semantic segmentation primarily focus on adaptation between image domains and do not utilize other abundant visual modalities like depth, infrared and event. This limitation hinders their performance and restricts their application in real-world multimodal scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Modality Adaptation with text-to-image Diffusion Models (MADM) for semantic segmentation task which utilizes text-to-image diffusion models pre-trained on extensive image-text pairs to enhance the model's cross-modality capabilities. Specifically, MADM comprises two key complementary components to tackle major challenges. First, due to the large modality gap, using one modal data to generate pseudo labels for another modality suffers from a significant drop in accuracy. To address this, MADM designs diffusion-based pseudo-label generation which adds latent noise to stabilize pseudo-labels and enhance label accuracy. Second, to overcome the limitations of latent low-resolution features in diffusion models, MADM introduces the label palette and latent regression which converts one-hot encoded labels into the RGB form by palette and regresses them in the latent space, thus ensuring the pre-trained decoder for up-sampling to obtain fine-grained features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MADM achieves state-of-the-art adaptation performance across various modality tasks, including images to depth, infrared, and event modalities. We open-source our code and models at https://github.com/XiaRho/MADM."
Poster,Unsupervised Object Detection with Theoretical Guarantees,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93107,"Marian Longa, João Henriques","Unsupervised object detection using deep neural networks is typically a difficult problem with few to no guarantees about the learned representation. In this work we present the first unsupervised object detection method that is theoretically guaranteed to recover the true object positions up to quantifiable small shifts. We develop an unsupervised object detection architecture and prove that the learned variables correspond to the true object positions up to small shifts related to the encoder and decoder receptive field sizes, the object sizes, and the widths of the Gaussians used in the rendering process. We perform detailed analysis of how the error depends on each of these variables and perform synthetic experiments validating our theoretical predictions up to a precision of individual pixels. We also perform experiments on CLEVR-based data and show that, unlike current SOTA object detection methods (SAM, CutLER), our method's prediction errors always lie within our theoretical bounds. We hope that this work helps open up an avenue of research into object detection methods with theoretical guarantees."
Poster,Untrained Neural Nets for Snapshot Compressive Imaging: Theory and Algorithms,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96437,"Mengyu Zhao, Xi Chen, Xin Yuan, Shirin Jalali","Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) recovers high-dimensional (3D) data cubes from a single 2D measurement, enabling diverse applications like video and hyperspectral imaging to go beyond standard techniques in terms of acquisition speed and efficiency. In this paper, we focus on SCI recovery algorithms that employ untrained neural networks (UNNs), such as deep image prior (DIP), to model source structure. Such UNN-based methods are appealing as they have the potential of avoiding the computationally intensive retraining required for different source models and different measurement scenarios. We first develop a theoretical framework for characterizing the performance of such UNN-based methods. The theoretical framework, on the one hand, enables us to optimize the parameters of data-modulating masks, and on the other hand, provides a fundamental connection between the number of data frames that can be recovered from a single measurement to the parameters of the untrained NN. We also employ the recently proposed bagged-deep-image-prior (bagged-DIP) idea to develop SCI Bagged Deep Video Prior (SCI-BDVP) algorithms that address the common challenges faced by standard UNN solutions. Our experimental results show that in video SCI our proposed solution achieves state-of-the-art among UNN methods, and in the case of noisy measurements, it even outperforms supervised solutions.

Poster,"Unveil Benign Overfitting for Transformer in Vision: Training Dynamics, Convergence, and Generalization",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95987,"Jiarui Jiang, Wei Huang, Miao Zhang, Taiji Suzuki, Liqiang Nie","Transformers have demonstrated great power in the recent development of large foundational models. In particular, the Vision Transformer (ViT) has brought revolutionary changes to the field of vision, achieving significant accomplishments on the experimental side. However, their theoretical capabilities, particularly in terms of generalization when trained to overfit training data, are still not fully understood. To address this gap, this work delves deeply into the \textit{benign overfitting} perspective of transformers in vision. To this end, we study the optimization of a Transformer composed of a self-attention layer with softmax followed by a fully connected layer under gradient descent on a certain data distribution model. By developing techniques that address the challenges posed by softmax and the interdependent nature of multiple weights in transformer optimization, we successfully characterized the training dynamics and achieved generalization in post-training. Our results establish a sharp condition that can distinguish between the small test error phase and the large test error regime, based on the signal-to-noise ratio in the data model. The theoretical results are further verified by experimental simulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to characterize benign overfitting for Transformers."
Poster,Unveiling and Mitigating Backdoor Vulnerabilities based on Unlearning Weight Changes and Backdoor Activeness,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95499,"Weilin Lin, Li Liu, Shaokui Wei, Jianze Li, Hui Xiong","The security threat of backdoor attacks is a central concern for deep neural networks (DNNs). Recently, without poisoned data, unlearning models with clean data and then learning a pruning mask have contributed to backdoor defense. Additionally, vanilla fine-tuning with those clean data can help recover the lost clean accuracy. However, the behavior of clean unlearning is still under-explored, and vanilla fine-tuning unintentionally induces back the backdoor effect. In this work, we first investigate model unlearning from the perspective of weight changes and gradient norms, and find two interesting observations in the backdoored model: 1) the weight changes between poison and clean unlearning are positively correlated, making it possible for us to identify the backdoored-related neurons without using poisoned data; 2) the neurons of the backdoored model are more active (*i.e.*, larger gradient norm) than those in the clean model, suggesting the need to suppress the gradient norm during fine-tuning. Then, we propose an effective two-stage defense method. In the first stage, an efficient *Neuron Weight Change (NWC)-based Backdoor Reinitialization* is proposed based on observation 1). In the second stage, based on observation 2), we design an *Activeness-Aware Fine-Tuning* to replace the vanilla fine-tuning. Extensive experiments, involving eight backdoor attacks on three benchmark datasets, demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to recent state-of-the-art backdoor defense approaches.

Poster,Unveiling Causal Reasoning in Large Language Models: Reality or Mirage?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96872,"Haoang Chi, He Li, Wenjing Yang, Feng Liu, Long Lan, Xiaoguang Ren, Tongliang Liu, Bo Han","Causal reasoning capability is critical in advancing large language models (LLMs) towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). While versatile LLMs appear to have demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and providing responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether they perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence indicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing shallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal knowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine human-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis, methodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of transformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal. Empirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark named CausalProbe 2024, whose corpus is fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. Empirical results show a significant performance drop on CausalProbe 2024 compared to earlier benchmarks, indicating that LLMs primarily engage in level-1 causal reasoning.To bridge the gap towards level-2 causal reasoning, we draw inspiration from the fact that human reasoning is usually facilitated by general knowledge and intended goals. Inspired by this, we propose G$^2$-Reasoner, a LLM causal reasoning method that incorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal reasoning processes. Experiments demonstrate that G$^2$-Reasoner significantly enhances LLMs' causal reasoning capability, particularly in fresh and fictitious contexts. This work sheds light on a new path for LLMs to advance towards genuine causal reasoning, going beyond level-1 and making strides towards level-2."
Poster,Unveiling Encoder-Free Vision-Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95075,"Haiwen Diao, Yufeng Cui, Xiaotong Li, Yueze Wang, Huchuan Lu, Xinlong Wang","Existing vision-language models (VLMs) mostly rely on vision encoders to extract visual features followed by large language models (LLMs) for visual-language tasks. However, the vision encoders set a strong inductive bias in abstracting visual representation, e.g., resolution, aspect ratio, and semantic priors, which could impede the flexibility and efficiency of the VLMs. Training pure VLMs that accept the seamless vision and language inputs, i.e., without vision encoders, remains challenging and rarely explored. Empirical observations reveal that direct training without encoders results in slow convergence and large performance gaps. In this work, we bridge the gap between encoder-based and encoder-free models, and present a simple yet effective training recipe towards pure VLMs. Specifically, we unveil the key aspects of training encoder-free VLMs efficiently via thorough experiments: (1) Bridging vision-language representation inside one unified decoder; (2) Enhancing visual recognition capability via extra supervision. With these strategies, we launch EVE, an encoder-free vision-language model that can be trained and forwarded efficiently. Notably, solely utilizing 35M publicly accessible data, EVE can impressively rival the encoder-based VLMs of similar capacities across multiple vision-language benchmarks. It significantly outperforms the counterpart Fuyu-8B with mysterious training procedures and undisclosed training data. We believe that EVE provides a transparent and efficient route for developing pure decoder-only architecture across modalities."
Poster,Unveiling Induction Heads: Provable Training Dynamics and Feature Learning in Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96647,"Siyu Chen, Heejune Sheen, Tianhao Wang, Zhuoran Yang","In-context learning (ICL) is a cornerstone of large language model (LLM) functionality, yet its theoretical foundations remain elusive due to the complexity of transformer architectures. In particular, most existing work only theoretically explains how the attention mechanism facilitates ICL under certain data models. It remains unclear how the other building blocks of the transformer contribute to ICL. To address this question, we study how a two-attention-layer transformer is trained to perform ICL on $n$-gram Markov chain data, where each token in the Markov chain statistically depends on the previous n tokens. We analyze a sophisticated transformer model featuring relative positional embedding, multi-head softmax attention,  and a feed-forward layer with normalization. We prove that the gradient flow with respect to a cross-entropy ICL loss converges to a limiting model that performs a generalized version of the ""induction head"" mechanism with a learned feature, resulting from the congruous contribution of all the building blocks. Specifically, the first attention layer acts as a copier, copying past tokens within a given window to each position, and the feed-forward network with normalization acts as a selector that generates a feature vector by only looking at informationally relevant parents from the window. Finally, the second attention layer is a classifier thatcompares these features with the feature at the output position, and uses the resulting similarity scores to generate the desired output. Our theory is further validated by simulation experiments."
Poster,Unveiling LoRA Intrinsic Ranks via Salience Analysis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93201,"Wenjun Ke, Jiahao Wang, Peng Wang, Jiajun Liu, Dong Nie, Guozheng Li, Yining Li","The immense parameter scale of large language models underscores the necessity for parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. Methods based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) assume the low-rank characteristics of the incremental matrix and optimize the matrix obtained from low-rank decomposition. Although effective, these methods are constrained by a fixed and unalterable intrinsic rank, neglecting the variable importance of matrices. Consequently, methods for adaptive rank allocation are proposed, among which AdaLoRA demonstrates excellent fine-tuning performance. AdaLoRA conducts adaptation based on singular value decomposition (SVD), dynamically allocating intrinsic ranks according to importance. However, it still struggles to achieve a balance between fine-tuning effectiveness and efficiency, leading to limited rank allocation space. Additionally, the importance measurement focuses only on parameters with minimal impact on the loss, neglecting the dominant role of singular values in SVD-based matrices and the fluctuations during training. To address these issues, we propose SalientLoRA, which adaptively optimizes intrinsic ranks of LoRA via salience measurement. Firstly, during rank allocation, the salience measurement analyses the variation of singular value magnitudes across multiple time steps and establishes their inter-dependency relationships to assess the matrix importance. This measurement mitigates instability and randomness that may arise during importance assessment. Secondly, to achieve a balance between fine-tuning performance and efficiency, we propose an adaptive adjustment of time-series window, which adaptively controls the size of time-series for significance measurement and rank reduction during training, allowing for rapid rank allocation while maintaining training stability. This mechanism enables matrics to set a higher initial rank, thus expanding the allocation space for ranks. To evaluate the generality of our method across various tasks, we conduct experiments on natural language understanding (NLU), natural language generation (NLG), and large model instruction tuning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SalientLoRA, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 0.96\%-3.56\% on multiple datasets. Furthermore, as the rank allocation space expands, our method ensures fine-tuning efficiency, achieving a speed improvement of 94.5\% compared to AdaLoRA. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Heyest/SalientLoRA."
