Poster,Statistical and Geometrical properties of the Kernel Kullback-Leibler divergence,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95140,"Anna Korba, Francis Bach, Clémentine CHAZAL","In this paper, we study the statistical and geometrical properties of the Kullback-Leibler divergence with kernel covariance operators (KKL) introduced by [Bach, 2022, Information Theory with Kernel Methods]. Unlike the classical Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence that involves density ratios, the KKL compares probability distributions through covariance operators (embeddings) in a reproducible kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and compute the Kullback-Leibler quantum divergence. This novel divergence hence shares parallel but different aspects with both the standard Kullback-Leibler between probability distributions and kernel embeddings metrics such as the maximum mean discrepancy. A limitation faced with the original KKL divergence is its inability to be defined for distributions with disjoint supports. To solve this problem, we propose in this paper a regularised variant that guarantees that divergence is well defined for all distributions. We derive bounds that quantify the deviation of the regularised KKL to the original one, as well as concentration bounds. In addition, we provide a closed-form expression for the regularised KKL, specifically applicable when the distributions consist of finite sets of points, which makes it implementable. Furthermore, we derive a Wasserstein gradient descent scheme of the KKL divergence in the case of discrete distributions, and study empirically its properties to transport a set of points to a target distribution."
Poster,Statistical-Computational Trade-offs for Density Estimation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95277,"Anders Aamand, Alexandr Andoni, Justin Chen, Piotr Indyk, Shyam Narayanan, Sandeep Silwal, Haike Xu","We study the density estimation problem defined as follows: given $k$ distributions $p_1, \ldots, p_k$ over a discrete domain $[n]$,  as well as a collection of samples chosen from a ""query"" distribution $q$ over $[n]$, output $p_i$ that is ""close"" to $q$. Recently Aamand et al. gave the first and only known result that achieves sublinear bounds in both the sampling complexity and the query time while preserving polynomial data structure space. However, their improvement over linear samples and time is only by subpolynomial factors.Our main result is a lower bound showing that, for a broad class of data structures, their bounds cannot be significantly improved. In particular, if an algorithm uses $O(n/\log^c k)$ samples for some constant $c>0$ and polynomial space, then the query time of the data structure must be at least $k^{1-O(1)/\log  \log  k}$, i.e., close to linear in the number of distributions $k$. This is a novel statistical-computational trade-off for density estimation, demonstrating that any data structure must use close to a linear number of samples or take close to linear query time. The lower bound holds even in the realizable case where $q=p_i$ for some $i$, and when the distributions are flat (specifically, all distributions are uniform over half of the domain $[n]$). We also give a simple data structure for our lower bound instance with asymptotically matching upper bounds. Experiments show that the data structure is quite efficient in practice."
Poster,Statistical Efficiency of Distributional Temporal Difference Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94263,"Yang Peng, Liangyu Zhang, Zhihua Zhang","Distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved empirical success in various domains.One of the core tasks in the field of DRL is distributional policy evaluation, which involves estimating the return distribution $\eta^\pi$ for a given policy $\pi$.The distributional temporal difference learning has been accordingly proposed, whichis an extension of the temporal difference learning (TD) in the classic RL area.In the tabular case,  Rowland et al. [2018] and Rowland et al. [2023] proved the asymptotic convergence of two instances of distributional TD, namely categorical temporal difference learning (CTD) and quantile temporal difference learning (QTD), respectively.In this paper, we go a step further and analyze the finite-sample performance of distributional TD.To facilitate theoretical analysis, we propose a non-parametric distributional TD learning (NTD).For a $\gamma$-discounted infinite-horizon tabular Markov decision process,we show that for NTD we need $\widetilde O\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{2p}(1-\gamma)^{2p+1}}\right)$ iterations to achieve an $\varepsilon$-optimal estimator with high probability, when the estimation error is measured by the $p$-Wasserstein distance.This sample complexity bound is minimax optimal (up to logarithmic factors) in the case of the $1$-Wasserstein distance.To achieve this, we establish a novel Freedman's inequality in Hilbert spaces, which would be of independent interest.In addition, we revisit CTD, showing that the same non-asymptotic convergence bounds hold for CTD in the case of the $p$-Wasserstein distance."
Poster,Statistical Estimation in the Spiked Tensor Model via the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94828,"Leo Zhou, Joao Basso, Song Mei","The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a general-purpose algorithm for combinatorial optimization that has been a promising avenue for near-term quantum advantage. In this paper, we analyze the performance of the QAOA on the spiked tensor model, a statistical estimation problem that exhibits a large computational-statistical gap classically. We prove that the weak recovery threshold of $1$-step QAOA matches that of $1$-step tensor power iteration. Additional heuristic calculations suggest that the weak recovery threshold of $p$-step QAOA matches that of $p$-step tensor power iteration when $p$ is a fixed constant. This further implies that multi-step QAOA with tensor unfolding could achieve, but not surpass, the asymptotic classical computation threshold $\Theta(n^{(q-2)/4})$ for spiked $q$-tensors. Meanwhile, we characterize the asymptotic overlap distribution for $p$-step QAOA, discovering an intriguing sine-Gaussian law verified through simulations. For some $p$ and $q$, the QAOA has an effective recovery threshold that is a constant factor better than tensor power iteration.Of independent interest, our proof techniques employ the Fourier transform to handle difficult combinatorial sums, a novel approach differing from prior QAOA analyses on spin-glass models without planted structure."
Poster,Statistical Inference for Fairness Auditing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/98330,"John Cherian, Emmanuel Candes","Before deploying a black-box model in high-stakes problems, it is important to evaluate the model’s performance on sensitive subpopulations. For example, in a recidivism prediction task, we may wish to identify demographic groups for which our prediction model has unacceptably high false positive rates or certify that no such groups exist. In this paper, we frame this task, often referred to as ``fairness auditing,''  in terms of multiple hypothesis testing. We show how the bootstrap can be used to simultaneously bound performance disparities over a collection of groups with statistical guarantees. Our methods can be used to flag subpopulations affected by model underperformance, and certify subpopulations for which the model performs adequately. Crucially, our audit is model-agnostic and applicable to nearly any performance metric or group fairness criterion. Our methods also accommodate extremely rich---even infinite---collections of subpopulations. Further, we generalize beyond subpopulations by showing how to assess performance over certain distribution shifts. We test the proposed methods on benchmark datasets in predictive inference and algorithmic fairness and find that our audits can provide interpretable and trustworthy guarantees."
Poster,Statistical Multicriteria Benchmarking via the GSD-Front,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93951,"Christoph Jansen, Georg Schollmeyer, Julian Rodemann, Hannah Blocher, Thomas Augustin","Given the vast number of classifiers that have been (and continue to be) proposed, reliable methods for comparing them are becoming increasingly important. The desire for reliability is broken down into three main aspects: (1) Comparisons should allow for different quality metrics simultaneously. (2) Comparisons should take into account the statistical uncertainty induced by the choice of benchmark suite. (3) The robustness of the comparisons under small deviations in the underlying assumptions should be verifiable. To address (1), we propose to compare classifiers using a generalized stochastic dominance ordering (GSD) and present the GSD-front as an information-efficient alternative to the classical Pareto-front. For (2), we propose a consistent statistical estimator for the GSD-front and construct a statistical test for whether a (potentially new) classifier lies in the GSD-front of a set of state-of-the-art classifiers. For (3), we relax our proposed test using techniques from robust statistics and imprecise probabilities. We illustrate our concepts on the benchmark suite PMLB and on the platform OpenML."
Poster,Stealth edits to large language models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93512,"Oliver Sutton, Qinghua Zhou, Wei Wang, Desmond Higham, Alexander N Gorban, Alexander Bastounis, Ivan Tyukin","We reveal the theoretical foundations of techniques for editing large language models, and present new methods which can do so without requiring retraining. Our theoretical insights show that a single metric (a measure of the intrinsic dimension of the model's features) can be used to assess a model's editability and reveals its previously unrecognised susceptibility to malicious *stealth attacks*. This metric is fundamental to predicting the success of a variety of editing approaches, and reveals new bridges between disparate families of editing methods. We collectively refer to these as *stealth editing* methods, because they directly update a model's weights to specify its response to specific known hallucinating prompts without affecting other model behaviour. By carefully applying our theoretical insights, we are able to introduce a new *jet-pack* network block which is optimised for highly selective model editing, uses only standard network operations, and can be inserted into existing networks. We also reveal the vulnerability of language models to stealth attacks: a small change to a model's weights which fixes its response to a single attacker-chosen prompt. Stealth attacks are computationally simple, do not require access to or knowledge of the model's training data, and therefore represent a potent yet previously unrecognised threat to redistributed foundation models. Extensive experimental results illustrate and support our methods and their theoretical underpinnings. Demos and source code are available at https://github.com/qinghua-zhou/stealth-edits."
Poster,StepbaQ: Stepping backward as Correction for Quantized Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94432,"Yi-Chung Chen, Zhi-Kai Huang, Jing-Ren Chen","Quantization of diffusion models has attracted considerable attention due to its potential to enable various applications on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, given the cumulative nature of quantization errors in quantized diffusion models, overall performance may still decline even with efforts to minimize quantization error at each sampling step.Recent studies have proposed several methods to address accumulated quantization error, yet these solutions often suffer from limited applicability due to their underlying assumptions or only partially resolve the issue due to an incomplete understanding.In this work, we introduce a novel perspective by conceptualizing quantization error as a ""stepback"" in the denoising process. We investigate how the accumulation of quantization error can distort the sampling trajectory, resulting in a notable decrease in model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce StepbaQ, a method that calibrates the sampling trajectory and counteracts the adverse effects of accumulated quantization error through a sampling step correction mechanism. Notably, StepbaQ relies solely on statistics of quantization error derived from a small calibration dataset, highlighting its strong applicability.Our experimental results demonstrate that StepbaQ can serve as a plug-and-play technique to enhance the performance of diffusion models quantized by off-the-shelf tools without modifying the quantization settings. For example, StepbaQ significantly improves the performance of the quantized SD v1.5 model by 7.30 in terms of FID on SDprompts dataset under the common W8A8 setting, and it enhances the performance of the quantized SDXL-Turbo model by 17.31 in terms of FID on SDprompts dataset under the challenging W4A8 setting."
Poster,Stepping Forward on the Last Mile,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93031,"Chen Feng, Jay Zhuo, Parker Zhang, Ramchalam Kinattinkara Ramakrishnan, Zhaocong Yuan, Andrew Zou Li","Continuously adapting pre-trained models to local data on resource constrained edge devices is the \emph{last mile} for model deployment. However, as models increase in size and depth, backpropagation requires a large amount of memory, which becomes prohibitive for edge devices. In addition, most existing low power neural processing engines (e.g., NPUs, DSPs, MCUs, etc.) are designed as fixed-point inference accelerators, without training capabilities. Forward gradients, solely based on directional derivatives computed from two forward calls, have been recently used for model training, with substantial savings in computation and memory. However, the performance of quantized training with fixed-point forward gradients remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of on-device training using fixed-point forward gradients, by conducting comprehensive experiments across a variety of deep learning benchmark tasks in both vision and audio domains. We propose a series of algorithm enhancements that further reduce the memory footprint, and the accuracy gap compared to backpropagation. An empirical study on how training with forward gradients navigates in the loss landscape is further explored. Our results demonstrate that on the last mile of model customization on edge devices, training with fixed-point forward gradients is a feasible and practical approach."
Poster,Stepping on the Edge: Curvature Aware Learning Rate Tuners,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95119,"Vincent Roulet, Atish Agarwala, Jean-Bastien Grill, Grzegorz Swirszcz, Mathieu Blondel, Fabian Pedregosa","Curvature information -- particularly, the largest eigenvalue of the lossHessian, known as the sharpness -- often forms the basis for learning ratetuners. However, recent work has shown that the curvature information undergoescomplex dynamics during training, going from a phase of increasing sharpness toeventual stabilization. We analyze the closed-loop feedback effect betweenlearning rate tuning and curvature. We find that classical learning rate tunersmay yield greater one-step loss reduction, yet they ultimately underperform inthe long term when compared to constant learning rates in the full batch regime.These models break the stabilization of the sharpness, which we explain using asimplified model of the joint dynamics of the learning rate and the curvature.To further investigate these effects, we introduce a new learning rate tuningmethod, Curvature Dynamics Aware Tuning (CDAT), which prioritizes long termcurvature stabilization over instantaneous progress on the objective. In thefull batch regime, CDAT shows behavior akin to prefixed warm-up schedules on deeplearning objectives, outperforming tuned constant learning rates. In the minibatch regime, we observe that stochasticity introduces confounding effects thatexplain the previous success of some learning rate tuners at appropriate batchsizes. Our findings highlight the critical role of understanding the jointdynamics of the learning rate and curvature, beyond greedy minimization, todiagnose failures and design effective adaptive learning rate tuners."
