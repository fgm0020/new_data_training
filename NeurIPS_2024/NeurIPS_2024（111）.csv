Poster,Disentangled Style Domain for Implicit $z$-Watermark Towards Copyright Protection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96662,"Junqiang Huang, Zhaojun Guo, Ge Luo, Zhenxing Qian, Sheng Li, Xinpeng Zhang","Text-to-image models have shown surprising performance in high-quality image generation, while also raising intensified concerns about the unauthorized usage of personal dataset in training and personalized fine-tuning. Recent approaches, embedding watermarks, introducing perturbations, and inserting backdoors into datasets, rely on adding minor information vulnerable to adversarial training, limiting their ability to detect unauthorized data usage. In this paper, we introduce a novel implicit Zero-Watermarking scheme that first utilizes the disentangled style domain to detect unauthorized dataset usage in text-to-image models. Specifically, our approach generates the watermark from the disentangled style domain, enabling self-generalization and mutual exclusivity within the style domain anchored by protected units. The domain achieves the maximum concealed offset of probability distribution through both the injection of identifier $z$ and dynamic contrastive learning, facilitating the structured delineation of dataset copyright boundaries for multiple sources of styles and contents. Additionally, we introduce the concept of watermark distribution to establish a verification mechanism for copyright ownership of hybrid or partial infringements, addressing deficiencies in the traditional mechanism of dataset copyright ownership for AI mimicry. Notably, our method achieves one-sample verification for copyright ownership in AI mimic generations.

Poster,Disentangled Unsupervised Skill Discovery for Efficient Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94271,"Jiaheng Hu, Zizhao Wang, Peter Stone, Roberto Martín-Martín","A hallmark of intelligent agents is the ability to learn reusable skills purely from unsupervised interaction with the environment. However, existing unsupervised skill discovery methods often learn entangled skills where one skill variable simultaneously influences many entities in the environment, making downstream skill chaining extremely challenging. We propose Disentangled Unsupervised Skill Discovery (DUSDi), a method for learning disentangled skills that can be efficiently reused to solve downstream tasks. DUSDi decomposes skills into disentangled components, where each skill component only affects one factor of the state space. Importantly, these skill components can be concurrently composed to generate low-level actions, and efficiently chained to tackle downstream tasks through hierarchical Reinforcement Learning. DUSDi defines a novel mutual-information-based objective to enforce disentanglement between the influences of different skill components, and utilizes value factorization to optimize this objective efficiently. Evaluated in a set of challenging environments, DUSDi successfully learns disentangled skills, and significantly outperforms previous skill discovery methods when it comes to applying the learned skills to solve downstream tasks."
Poster,Disentangling and mitigating the impact of task similarity for continual learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94505,Naoki Hiratani,"Continual learning of partially similar tasks poses a challenge for artificial neural networks, as task similarity presents both an opportunity for knowledge transfer and a risk of interference and catastrophic forgetting.However, it remains unclear how task similarity in input features and readout patterns influences knowledge transfer and forgetting, as well as how they interact with common algorithms for continual learning.Here, we develop a linear teacher-student model with latent structure and show analytically that high input feature similarity coupled with low readout similarity is catastrophic for both knowledge transfer and retention. Conversely, the opposite scenario is relatively benign. Our analysis further reveals that task-dependent activity gating improves knowledge retention at the expense of transfer, while task-dependent plasticity gating does not affect either retention or transfer performance at the over-parameterized limit. In contrast, weight regularization based on the Fisher information metric significantly improves retention, regardless of task similarity, without compromising transfer performance. Nevertheless, its diagonal approximation and regularization in the Euclidean space are much less robust against task similarity. We demonstrate consistent results in a permuted MNIST task with latent variables. Overall, this work provides insights into when continual learning is difficult and how to mitigate it."
Poster,Disentangling Interpretable Factors with Supervised Independent Subspace Principal Component Analysis,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96270,"Jiayu Su, David A Knowles, Raúl Rabadán","The success of machine learning models relies heavily on effectively representing high-dimensional data. However, ensuring data representations capture human-understandable concepts remains difficult, often requiring the incorporation of prior knowledge and decomposition of data into multiple subspaces. Traditional linear methods fall short in modeling more than one space, while more expressive deep learning approaches lack interpretability. Here, we introduce Supervised Independent Subspace Principal Component Analysis ($\texttt{sisPCA}$), a PCA extension designed for multi-subspace learning. Leveraging the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), $\texttt{sisPCA}$ incorporates supervision and simultaneously ensures subspace disentanglement. We demonstrate $\texttt{sisPCA}$'s connections with autoencoders and regularized linear regression and showcase its ability to identify and separate hidden data structures through extensive applications, including breast cancer diagnosis from image features, learning aging-associated DNA methylation changes, and single-cell analysis of malaria infection. Our results reveal distinct functional pathways associated with malaria colonization, underscoring the essentiality of explainable representation in high-dimensional data analysis."
Poster,Disentangling Linear Quadratic Control with Untrusted ML Predictions,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94827,"Tongxin Li, Hao Liu, Yisong Yue","Uncertain perturbations in dynamical systems often arise from diverse resources, represented by latent components. The predictions for these components, typically generated by ""black-box"" machine learning tools, are prone to inaccuracies. To tackle this challenge, we introduce DISC, a novel policy that learns a confidence parameter online to harness the potential of accurate predictions while also mitigating the impact of erroneous forecasts. When predictions are precise, DISC leverages this information to achieve near-optimal performance. Conversely, in the case of significant prediction errors, it still has a worst-case competitive ratio guarantee. We provide competitive ratio bounds for DISC under both linear mixing of latent variables as well as a broader class of mixing functions. Our results highlight a first-of-its-kind ""best-of-both-worlds"" integration of machine-learned predictions, thus lead to a near-optimal consistency and robustness tradeoff, which provably improves what can be obtained without learning the confidence parameter. We validate the applicability of DISC across a spectrum of practical scenarios."
Poster,Disentangling the Roles of Distinct Cell Classes with Cell-Type Dynamical Systems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96294,"Aditi Jha, Diksha Gupta, Carlos Brody, Jonathan Pillow","Latent dynamical systems have been widely used to characterize the dynamics of neural population activity in the brain. However, these models typically ignore the fact that the brain contains multiple cell types. This limits their ability to capture the functional roles of distinct cell classes, and to predict the effects of cell-specific perturbations on neural activity or behavior. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the `""cell-type dynamical systems"" (CTDS) model. This model extends latent linear dynamical systems to contain distinct latent variables for each cell class, with biologically inspired constraints on both dynamics and emissions. To illustrate our approach, we consider neural recordings with distinct excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) populations. The CTDS model defines separate latents for both cell types, and constrains the dynamics so that E (I) latents have a strictly positive (negative) effects on other latents. We applied CTDS to recordings from rat frontal orienting fields (FOF) and anterior dorsal striatum (ADS) during an auditory decision-making task. The model achieved higher accuracy than a standard linear dynamical system (LDS), and revealed that the animal's choice can be decoded from both E and I latents and thus is not restricted to a single cell-class. We also performed in-silico optogenetic perturbation experiments in the FOF and ADS, and found that CTDS was able to replicate the experimentally observed effects of different perturbations on behavior, whereas a standard LDS model---which does not differentiate between cell types---did not. Crucially, our model allowed us to understand the effects of these perturbations by revealing the dynamics of different cell-specific latents. Finally, CTDS can also be used to identify cell types for neurons whose class labels are unknown in electrophysiological recordings. These results illustrate the power of the CTDS model to provide more accurate and more biologically interpretable descriptions of neural population dynamics and their relationship to behavior."
Poster,Dispelling the Mirage of Progress in Offline MARL through Standardised Baselines and Evaluation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97812,"Juan Formanek, Callum R. Tilbury, Louise Beyers, Jonathan Shock, Arnu Pretorius","Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is an emerging field with great promise for real-world applications. Unfortunately, the current state of research in offline MARL is plagued by inconsistencies in baselines and evaluation protocols, which ultimately makes it difficult to accurately assess progress, trust newly proposed innovations, and allow researchers to easily build upon prior work. In this paper, we firstly identify significant shortcomings in existing methodologies for measuring the performance of novel algorithms through a representative study of published offline MARL work. Secondly, by directly comparing to this prior work, we demonstrate that simple, well-implemented baselines can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across a wide range of tasks. Specifically, we show that on 35 out of 47 datasets used in prior work (almost 75\% of cases), we match or surpass the performance of the current purported SOTA. Strikingly, our baselines often substantially outperform these more sophisticated algorithms.  Finally, we correct for the shortcomings highlighted from this prior work by introducing a straightforward standardised methodology for evaluation and by providing our baseline implementations with statistically robust results across several scenarios, useful for comparisons in future work. Our proposal includes simple and sensible steps that are easy to adopt, which in combination with solid baselines and comparative results, could substantially improve the overall rigour of empirical science in offline MARL moving forward."
Poster,DISP-LLM: Dimension-Independent Structural Pruning for Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94663,"Shangqian Gao, Chi-Heng Lin, Ting Hua, Zheng Tang, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin, Yen-Chang Hsu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks, including language modeling, understanding, and generation. However, the increased memory and computational costs associated with these models pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-limited devices. Structural pruning has emerged as a promising solution to reduce the costs of LLMs without requiring post-processing steps. Prior structural pruning methods either follow the dependence of structures at the cost of limiting flexibility, or introduce non-trivial additional parameters by incorporating different projection matrices. In this work, we propose a novel approach that relaxes the constraint imposed by regular structural pruning methods and eliminates the structural dependence along the embedding dimension. Our dimension-independent structural pruning method offers several benefits. Firstly, our method enables different blocks to utilize different subsets of the feature maps. Secondly, by removing structural dependence, we facilitate each block to possess varying widths along its input and output dimensions, thereby significantly enhancing the flexibility of structural pruning. We evaluate our method on various LLMs, including OPT, LLaMA, LLaMA-2, Phi-1.5, and Phi-2. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, showing for the first time that structural pruning can achieve an accuracy similar to semi-structural pruning."
Poster,Dissect Black Box: Interpreting for Rule-Based Explanations in Unsupervised Anomaly Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94091,"Yu Zhang, Ruoyu Li, Nengwu Wu, Qing Li, Xinhan Lin, Yang Hu, Tao Li, Yong Jiang","In high-stakes sectors such as network security, IoT security, accurately distinguishing between normal and anomalous data is critical due to the significant implications for operational success and safety in decision-making. The complexity is exacerbated by the presence of unlabeled data and the opaque nature of black-box anomaly detection models, which obscure the rationale behind their predictions. In this paper, we present a novel method to interpret the decision-making processes of these models, which are essential for detecting malicious activities without labeled attack data. We put forward the Segmentation Clustering Decision Tree (SCD-Tree), designed to dissect and understand the structure of normal data distributions. The SCD-Tree integrates predictions from the anomaly detection model into its splitting criteria, enhancing the clustering process with the model's insights into anomalies. To further refine these segments,  the Gaussian Boundary Delineation (GBD) algorithm is employed to define boundaries within each segmented distribution, effectively delineating normal from anomalous data points. At this point, this approach addresses the curse of dimensionality by segmenting high-dimensional data and ensures resilience to data drift and perturbations through flexible boundary fitting. We transform the intricate operations of anomaly detection into an interpretable rule's format, constructing a comprehensive set of rules for understanding.  Our method's evaluation on diverse datasets and models demonstrates superior explanation accuracy, fidelity, and robustness over existing method, proving its efficacy in environments where interpretability is paramount."
Poster,Dissecting Query-Key Interaction in Vision Transformers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94346,"Xu Pan, Aaron Philip, Ziqian Xie, Odelia Schwartz","Self-attention in vision transformers is often thought to perform perceptual grouping where tokens attend to other tokens with similar embeddings, which could correspond to semantically similar features of an object. However, attending to dissimilar tokens can be beneficial by providing contextual information. We propose to analyze the query-key interaction by the singular value decomposition of the interaction matrix (i.e. ${\textbf{W}_q}^\top\textbf{W}_k$). We find that in many ViTs, especially those with classification training objectives, early layers attend more to similar tokens, while late layers show increased attention to dissimilar tokens, providing evidence corresponding to perceptual grouping and contextualization, respectively. Many of these interactions between features represented by singular vectors are interpretable and semantic, such as attention between relevant objects, between parts of an object, or between the foreground and background. This offers a novel perspective on interpreting the attention mechanism, which contributes to understanding how transformer models utilize context and salient features when processing images."
