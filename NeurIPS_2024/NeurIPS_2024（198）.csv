Poster,Improving Decision Sparsity,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95887,"Yiyang Sun, Tong Wang, Cynthia Rudin","Sparsity is a central aspect of interpretability in machine learning. Typically, sparsity is measured in terms of the size of a model globally, such as the number of variables it uses. However, this notion of sparsity is not particularly relevant for decision making; someone subjected to a decision does not care about variables that do not contribute to the decision. In this work, we dramatically expand a notion of *decision sparsity* called the *Sparse Explanation Value* (SEV) so that its explanations are more meaningful. SEV considers movement along a hypercube towards a reference point. By allowing flexibility in that reference and by considering how distances along the hypercube translate to distances in feature space, we can derive sparser and more meaningful explanations for various types of function classes. We present cluster-based SEV and its variant tree-based SEV, introduce a method that improves credibility of explanations, and propose algorithms that optimize decision sparsity in machine learning models."
Poster,Improving Deep Learning Optimization through Constrained Parameter Regularization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93452,"Jörg Franke, Michael Hefenbrock, Gregor Koehler, Frank Hutter","Regularization is a critical component in deep learning. The most commonly used approach, weight decay, applies a constant penalty coefficient uniformly across all parameters. This may be overly restrictive for some parameters, while insufficient for others. To address this, we present Constrained Parameter Regularization (CPR) as an alternative to traditional weight decay. Unlike the uniform application of a single penalty, CPR enforces an upper bound on a statistical measure, such as the L$_2$-norm, of individual parameter matrices. Consequently, learning becomes a constraint optimization problem, which we tackle using an adaptation of the augmented Lagrangian method. CPR introduces only a minor runtime overhead and only requires setting an upper bound. We propose simple yet efficient mechanisms for initializing this bound, making CPR rely on no hyperparameter or one, akin to weight decay. Our empirical studies on computer vision and language modeling tasks demonstrate CPR's effectiveness. The results show that CPR can outperform traditional weight decay and increase performance in pre-training and fine-tuning."
Poster,Improving Deep Reinforcement Learning by Reducing the Chain Effect of Value and Policy Churn,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94420,"Hongyao Tang, Glen Berseth","Deep neural networks provide Reinforcement Learning (RL) powerful function approximators to address large-scale decision-making problems. However, these approximators introduce challenges due to the non-stationary nature of RL training. One source of the challenges in RL is that output predictions can churn, leading to uncontrolled changes after each batch update for states not included in the batch. Although such a churn phenomenon exists in each step of network training, it remains under-explored on how churn occurs and impacts RL. In this work, we start by characterizing churn in a view of Generalized Policy Iteration with function approximation, and we discover a chain effect of churn that leads to a cycle where the churns in value estimation and policy improvement compound and bias the learning dynamics throughout the iteration. Further, we concretize the study and focus on the learning issues caused by the chain effect in different settings, including greedy action deviation in value-based methods, trust region violation in proximal policy optimization, and dual bias of policy value in actor-critic methods. We then propose a method to reduce the chain effect across different settings, called Churn Approximated ReductIoN (CHAIN), which can be easily plugged into most existing DRL algorithms. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both reducing churn and improving learning performance across online and offline, value-based and policy-based RL settings."
Poster,Improving Environment Novelty Quantification for Effective Unsupervised Environment Design,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94954,"Jayden Teoh, Wenjun Li, Pradeep Varakantham","Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) formalizes the problem of autocurricula through interactive training between a teacher agent and a student agent. The teacher generates new training environments with high learning potential, curating an adaptive curriculum that strengthens the student's ability to handle unseen scenarios. Existing UED methods mainly rely on *regret*, a metric that measures the difference between the agent's optimal and actual performance, to guide curriculum design. Regret-driven methods generate curricula that progressively increase environment complexity for the student but overlook environment *novelty* — a critical element for enhancing an agent's generalizability. Measuring environment novelty is especially challenging due to the underspecified nature of environment parameters in UED, and existing approaches face significant limitations. To address this, this paper introduces the *Coverage-based Evaluation of Novelty In Environment* (CENIE) framework. CENIE proposes a scalable, domain-agnostic, and curriculum-aware approach to quantifying environment novelty by leveraging the student's state-action space coverage from previous curriculum experiences. We then propose an implementation of CENIE that models this coverage and measures environment novelty using Gaussian Mixture Models. By integrating both regret and novelty as complementary objectives for curriculum design, CENIE facilitates effective exploration across the state-action space while progressively increasing curriculum complexity. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that augmenting existing regret-based UED algorithms with CENIE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, underscoring the effectiveness of novelty-driven autocurricula for robust generalization."
Poster,Improving Equivariant Model Training via Constraint Relaxation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93327,"Stefanos Pertigkiozoglou, Evangelos Chatzipantazis, Shubhendu Trivedi, Kostas Daniilidis","Equivariant neural networks have been widely used in a variety of applications due to their ability to generalize well in tasks where the underlying data symmetries are known. Despite their successes, such networks can be difficult to optimize and require careful hyperparameter tuning to train successfully. In this work, we propose a novel framework for improving the optimization of such models by relaxing the hard equivariance constraint during training: We relax the equivariance constraint of the network's intermediate layers by introducing an additional non-equivariant term that we progressively constrain until we arrive at an equivariant solution. By controlling the magnitude of the activation of the additional relaxation term, we allow the model to optimize over a larger hypothesis space containing approximate equivariant networks and converge back to an equivariant solution at the end of training. We provide experimental results on different state-of-the-art network architectures, demonstrating how this training framework can result in equivariant models with improved generalization performance.

Poster,Improving Generalization and Convergence by Enhancing Implicit Regularization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94395,"Mingze Wang, Jinbo Wang, Haotian He, Zilin Wang, Guanhua Huang, Feiyu Xiong, Zhiyu li, Weinan E, Lei Wu","In this work, we propose an Implicit Regularization Enhancement (IRE) framework to accelerate the discovery of flat solutions in deep learning, thereby improving generalization and convergence. Specifically, IRE decouples the dynamics of flat and sharp directions, which boosts the sharpness reduction along flat directions while maintaining the training stability in sharp directions. We show that IRE can be practically incorporated with *generic base optimizers* without introducing significant computational overload. Experiments show that IRE consistently improves the generalization performance for image classification tasks across a variety of benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet) and models (ResNets and ViTs). Surprisingly, IRE also  achieves a $2\times$ *speed-up* compared to AdamW in the pre-training of Llama models (of sizes ranging from 60M to 229M) on datasets including Wikitext-103, Minipile, and Openwebtext. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees, showing that IRE can substantially accelerate the convergence towards flat minima in Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM)."
Poster,Improving Generalization in Federated Learning with Model-Data Mutual Information Regularization: A Posterior Inference Approach,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96500,"Hao Zhang, Chenglin Li, Nuowen Kan, Ziyang Zheng, Wenrui Dai, Junni Zou, Hongkai Xiong","Most of existing federated learning (FL) formulation is treated as a point-estimate of models, inherently prone to overfitting on scarce client-side data with overconfident decisions. Though Bayesian inference can alleviate this issue, a direct posterior inference at clients may result in biased local posterior estimates due to data heterogeneity, leading to a sub-optimal global posterior. From an information-theoretic perspective, we propose FedMDMI, a federated posterior inference framework based on model-data mutual information (MI). Specifically, a global model-data MI term is introduced as regularization to enforce the global model to learn essential information from the heterogeneous local data, alleviating the bias caused by data heterogeneity and hence enhancing generalization. To make this global MI tractable, we decompose it into local MI terms at the clients, converting the global objective with MI regularization into several locally optimizable objectives based on local data. For these local objectives, we further show that the optimal local posterior is a Gibbs posterior, which can be efficiently sampled with stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics methods. Finally, at the server, we approximate sampling from the global Gibbs posterior by simply averaging samples from the local posteriors. Theoretical analysis provides a generalization bound for FL w.r.t. the model-data MI, which, at different levels of regularization, represents a federated version of the bias-variance trade-off. Experimental results demonstrate a better generalization behavior with better calibrated uncertainty estimates of FedMDMI."
Poster,Improving Generalization of Dynamic Graph Learning via Environment Prompt,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95180,"Kuo Yang, Zhengyang Zhou, Qihe Huang, Limin Li, Yuxuan Liang, Yang Wang","Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization issue is a well-known challenge within deep learning tasks. In dynamic graphs, the change of temporal environments is regarded as the main cause of data distribution shift. While numerous OOD studies focusing on environment factors have achieved remarkable performance, they still fail to systematically solve the two issue of environment inference and utilization. In this work, we propose a novel dynamic graph learning model named EpoD based on prompt learning and structural causal model to comprehensively enhance both environment inference and utilization. Inspired by the superior performance of prompt learning in understanding underlying semantic and causal associations, we first design a self-prompted  learning  mechanism to infer unseen environment factors. We then rethink the role of environment variable within spatio-temporal causal structure model, and introduce a novel causal pathway where dynamic subgraphs serve as mediating variables. The extracted dynamic subgraph can effectively capture the data distribution shift  by incorporating the inferred environment variables into the node-wise dependencies. Theoretical discussions and intuitive analysis support the generalizability and interpretability of EpoD. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets across domains showcase the superiority of EpoD against baselines, and toy example experiments further verify the powerful interpretability and rationality of our EpoD."
Poster,Improving Gloss-free Sign Language Translation by Reducing Representation Density,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95941,"Jinhui Ye, Xing Wang, Wenxiang Jiao, Junwei Liang, Hui Xiong","Gloss-free sign language translation (SLT) aims to develop well-performing SLT systems with no requirement for the costly gloss annotations, but currently still lags behind gloss-based approaches significantly. In this paper, we identify **a representation density problem** that could be a bottleneck in restricting the performance of gloss-free SLT. Specifically, the representation density problem describes that the visual representations of semantically distinct sign gestures tend to be closely packed together in feature space, which makes gloss-free methods struggle with distinguishing different sign gestures and suffer from a sharp performance drop. To address the representation density problem, we introduce a simple but effective contrastive learning strategy, namely SignCL, which encourages gloss-free models to learn more discriminative feature representation in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed SignCL can significantly reduce the representation density and improve performance across various translation frameworks. Specifically, SignCLachieves a significant improvement in BLEU score for the Sign Language Transformer and GFSLT-VLP on the CSL-Daily dataset by 39\% and 46\%, respectively, without any increase of model parameters. Compared to Sign2GPT, a state-of-the-art method based on large-scale pre-trained vision and language models, SignCLachieves better performance with only 35\% of its parameters. We will release our code and model to facilitate further research."
Poster,Improving Linear System Solvers for Hyperparameter Optimisation in Iterative Gaussian Processes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96158,"Jihao Andreas Lin, Shreyas Padhy, Bruno Mlodozeniec, Javier Antorán, José Miguel Hernández-Lobato","Scaling hyperparameter optimisation to very large datasets remains an open problem in the Gaussian process community. This paper focuses on iterative methods, which use linear system solvers, like conjugate gradients, alternating projections or stochastic gradient descent, to construct an estimate of the marginal likelihood gradient. We discuss three key improvements which are applicable across solvers: (i) a pathwise gradient estimator, which reduces the required number of solver iterations and amortises the computational cost of making predictions, (ii) warm starting linear system solvers with the solution from the previous step, which leads to faster solver convergence at the cost of negligible bias, (iii) early stopping linear system solvers after a limited computational budget, which synergises with warm starting, allowing solver progress to accumulate over multiple marginal likelihood steps. These techniques provide speed-ups of up to $72\times$ when solving to tolerance, and decrease the average residual norm by up to $7\times$ when stopping early."
