Poster,Neglected Hessian component explains mysteries in sharpness regularization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93774,"Yann Dauphin, Atish Agarwala, Hossein Mobahi","Recent work has shown that methods that regularize second order information like SAM can improve generalization in deep learning. Seemingly similar methods like weight noise and gradient penalties often fail to provide such benefits. We investigate this inconsistency and reveal its connection to the the structure of the Hessian of the loss. Specifically, its decomposition into the positive semi-definite Gauss-Newton matrix and an indefinite matrix, which we call the Nonlinear Modeling Error (NME) matrix. Previous studies have largely overlooked the significance of the NME in their analysis for various reasons. However, we provide empirical and theoretical evidence that the NME is important to the performance of gradient penalties and explains their sensitivity to activation functions. We also provide evidence that the difference in regularization performance between gradient penalties and weight noise can be explained by the NME. Our findings emphasize the necessity of considering the NME in both experimental design and theoretical analysis for sharpness regularization."
Poster,NeoRL: Efficient Exploration for Nonepisodic RL,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94633,"Bhavya, Lenart Treven, Florian Dorfler, Stelian Coros, Andreas Krause","We study the problem of nonepisodic reinforcement learning (RL) for nonlinear dynamical systems, where the system dynamics are unknown and the RL agent has to learn from a single trajectory, i.e., without resets. We propose **N**on**e**pisodic **O**ptistmic **RL** (NeoRL), an approach based on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty. NeoRL uses well-calibrated probabilistic models and plans optimistically w.r.t. the epistemic uncertainty about the unknown dynamics. Under continuity and bounded energy assumptions on the system, weprovide a first-of-its-kind regret bound of  $\mathcal{O}(\beta_T \sqrt{T \Gamma_T})$ for general nonlinear systems with Gaussian process dynamics. We compare NeoRL to other baselines on several deep RL environments and empirically demonstrate that NeoRL achieves the optimal average cost while incurring the least regret."
Poster,Nesterov acceleration despite very noisy gradients,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93909,"Kanan Gupta, Jonathan W. Siegel, Stephan Wojtowytsch","We present a generalization of Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent algorithm. Our algorithm (AGNES) provably achieves acceleration for smooth convex and strongly convex minimization tasks with noisy gradient estimates if the noise intensity is proportional to the magnitude of the gradient at every point. Nesterov's method converges at an accelerated rate if the constant of proportionality is below 1, while AGNES accommodates any signal-to-noise ratio. The noise model is motivated by applications in overparametrized machine learning. AGNES requires only two parameters in convex and three in strongly convex minimization tasks, improving on existing methods. We further provide clear geometric interpretations and heuristics for the choice of parameters."
Poster,NetworkGym: Reinforcement Learning Environments for Multi-Access Traffic Management in Network Simulation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97863,"Momin Haider, Ming Yin, Menglei Zhang, Arpit Gupta, Jing Zhu, Yu-Xiang Wang","Mobile devices such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets can often connect to multiple access networks (e.g., Wi-Fi, LTE, and 5G) simultaneously.Recent advancements facilitate seamless integration of these connections below the transport layer, enhancing the experience for apps that lack inherent multi-path support.This optimization hinges on dynamically determining the traffic distribution across networks for each device, a process referred to as multi-access traffic splitting.This paper introduces NetworkGym, a high-fidelity network environment simulator that facilitates generating multiple network traffic flows and multi-access traffic splitting.This simulator facilitates training and evaluating different RL-based solutions for the multi-access traffic splitting problem.Our initial explorations demonstrate that the majority of existing state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms (e.g. CQL) fail to outperform certain hand-crafted heuristic policies on average.This illustrates the urgent need to evaluate offline RL algorithms against a broader range of benchmarks, rather than relying solely on popular ones such as D4RL.We also propose an extension to the TD3+BC algorithm, named Pessimistic TD3 (PTD3), and demonstrate that it outperforms many state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms.PTD3's behavioral constraint mechanism, which relies on value-function pessimism, is theoretically motivated and relatively simple to implement.We open source our code and offline datasets at github.com/hmomin/networkgym."
Poster,Neuc-MDS: Non-Euclidean Multidimensional Scaling Through Bilinear Forms,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96368,"Chengyuan Deng, Jie Gao, Kevin Lu, Feng Luo, Hongbin Sun, Cheng Xin","We introduce \textbf{N}on-\textbf{Euc}lidean-\textbf{MDS} (Neuc-MDS), which extends Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to generate outputs that can be non-Euclidean and non-metric. The main idea is to generalize the inner product to other symmetric bilinear forms to utilize the negative eigenvalues of dissimiliarity Gram matrices. Neuc-MDS efficiently optimizes the choice of (both positive and negative) eigenvalues of the dissimilarity Gram matrix to reduce STRESS, the sum of squared pairwise error. We provide an in-depth error analysis and proofs of the optimality in minimizing lower bounds of STRESS. We demonstrate Neuc-MDS's ability to address limitations of classical MDS raised by prior research, and test it on various synthetic and real-world datasets in comparison with both linear and non-linear dimension reduction methods."
Poster,NeuMA: Neural Material Adaptor for Visual Grounding of Intrinsic Dynamics,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96224,"Junyi Cao, Shanyan Guan, Yanhao Ge, Wei Li, Xiaokang Yang, Chao Ma","While humans effortlessly discern intrinsic dynamics and adapt to new scenarios, modern AI systems often struggle. Current methods for visual grounding of dynamics either use pure neural-network-based simulators (black box), which may violate physical laws, or traditional physical simulators (white box), which rely on expert-defined equations that may not fully capture actual dynamics. We propose the Neural Material Adaptor (NeuMA), which integrates existing physical laws with learned corrections, facilitating accurate learning of actual dynamics while maintaining the generalizability and interpretability of physical priors. Additionally, we propose Particle-GS, a particle-driven 3D Gaussian Splatting variant that bridges simulation and observed images, allowing back-propagate image gradients to optimize the simulator. Comprehensive experiments on various dynamics in terms of grounded particle accuracy, dynamic rendering quality, and generalization ability demonstrate that NeuMA can accurately capture intrinsic dynamics.

Poster,Neur2BiLO: Neural Bilevel Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94240,"Justin Dumouchelle, Esther Julien, Jannis Kurtz, Elias Khalil","Bilevel optimization deals with nested problems in which *leader* takes the first decision to minimize their objective function while accounting for a *follower*'s best-response reaction. Constrained bilevel problems with integer variables are particularly notorious for their hardness. While exact solvers have been proposed for mixed-integer *linear* bilevel optimization, they tend to scale poorly with problem size and are hard to generalize to the non-linear case. On the other hand, problem-specific algorithms (exact and heuristic) are limited in scope. Under a data-driven setting in which similar instances of a bilevel problem are solved routinely, our proposed framework, Neur2BiLO, embeds a neural network approximation of the leader's or follower's value function, trained via supervised regression, into an easy-to-solve mixed-integer program.  Neur2BiLO serves as a heuristic that produces high-quality solutions extremely fast for four applications with linear and non-linear objectives and pure and mixed-integer variables."
Poster,Neural Assets: 3D-Aware Multi-Object Scene Synthesis with Image Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94290,"Ziyi Wu, Yulia Rubanova, Rishabh Kabra, Drew Hudson, Igor Gilitschenski, Yusuf Aytar, Sjoerd van Steenkiste, Kelsey Allen, Thomas Kipf","We address the problem of multi-object 3D pose control in image diffusion models. Instead of conditioning on a sequence of text tokens, we propose to use a set of per-object representations, *Neural Assets*, to control the 3D pose of individual objects in a scene. Neural Assets are obtained by pooling visual representations of objects from a reference image, such as a frame in a video, and are trained to reconstruct the respective objects in a different image, e.g., a later frame in the video. Importantly, we encode object visuals from the reference image while conditioning on object poses from the target frame, which enables learning disentangled appearance and position features. Combining visual and 3D pose representations in a sequence-of-tokens format allows us to keep the text-to-image interface of existing models, with Neural Assets in place of text tokens. By fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model with this information, our approach enables fine-grained 3D pose and placement control of individual objects in a scene. We further demonstrate that Neural Assets can be transferred and recomposed across different scenes. Our model achieves state-of-the-art multi-object editing results on both synthetic 3D scene datasets, as well as two real-world video datasets (Objectron, Waymo Open)."
Poster,Neural Characteristic Activation Analysis and Geometric Parameterization for ReLU Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96466,"Wenlin Chen, Hong Ge","We introduce a novel approach for analyzing the training dynamics of ReLU networks by examining the characteristic activation boundaries of individual ReLU neurons. Our proposed analysis reveals a critical instability in common neural network parameterizations and normalizations during stochastic optimization, which impedes fast convergence and hurts generalization performance. Addressing this, we propose Geometric Parameterization (GmP), a novel neural network parameterization technique that effectively separates the radial and angular components of weights in the hyperspherical coordinate system. We show theoretically that GmP resolves the aforementioned instability issue. We report empirical results on various models and benchmarks to verify GmP's advantages of optimization stability, convergence speed and generalization performance."
Poster,NeuralClothSim: Neural Deformation Fields Meet the Thin Shell Theory,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93518,"Navami Kairanda, Marc Habermann, Christian Theobalt, Vladislav Golyanik","Despite existing 3D cloth simulators producing realistic results, they predominantly operate on discrete surface representations (e.g. points and meshes) with a fixed spatial resolution, which often leads to large memory consumption and resolution-dependent simulations. Moreover, back-propagating gradients through the existing solvers is difficult and they hence cannot be easily integrated into modern neural architectures. In response, this paper re-thinks physically plausible cloth simulation: We propose NeuralClothSim, i.e., a new quasistatic cloth simulator using thin shells, in which surface deformation is encoded in neural network weights in form of a neural field. Our memory-efficient solver operates on a new continuous coordinate-based surface representation called neural deformation fields (NDFs); it supervises NDF equilibria with the laws of the non-linear Kirchhoff-Love shell theory with a non-linear anisotropic material model. NDFs are adaptive: They 1) allocate their capacity to the deformation details and 2) allow surface state queries at arbitrary spatial resolutions without re-training. We show how to train NeuralClothSim while imposing hard boundary conditions and demonstrate multiple applications, such as material interpolation and simulation editing. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our continuous neural formulation."
