Poster,FNP: Fourier Neural Processes for Arbitrary-Resolution Data Assimilation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96630,"Kun Chen, Peng Ye, Hao Chen, kang chen, Tao Han, Wanli Ouyang, Tao Chen, LEI BAI","Data assimilation is a vital component in modern global medium-range weather forecasting systems to obtain the best estimation of the atmospheric state by combining the short-term forecast and observations. Recently, AI-based data assimilation approaches have attracted increasing attention for their significant advantages over traditional techniques in terms of computational consumption. However, existing AI-based data assimilation methods can only handle observations with a specific resolution, lacking the compatibility and generalization ability to assimilate observations with other resolutions. Considering that complex real-world observations often have different resolutions, we propose the Fourier Neural Processes (FNP) for arbitrary-resolution data assimilation in this paper. Leveraging the efficiency of the designed modules and flexible structure of neural processes, FNP achieves state-of-the-art results in assimilating observations with varying resolutions, and also exhibits increasing advantages over the counterparts as the resolution and the amount of observations increase. Moreover, our FNP trained on a fixed resolution can directly handle the assimilation of observations with out-of-distribution resolutions and the observational information reconstruction task without additional fine-tuning, demonstrating its excellent generalization ability across data resolutions as well as across tasks.

Poster,F-OAL: Forward-only Online Analytic Learning with Fast Training and Low Memory Footprint in Class Incremental Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93448,"HUIPING ZHUANG, Yuchen Liu, Run He, Kai Tong, Ziqian Zeng, Cen Chen, Yi Wang, Lap-Pui Chau","Online Class Incremental Learning (OCIL) aims to train models incrementally, where data arrive in mini-batches, and previous data are not accessible. A major challenge in OCIL is Catastrophic Forgetting, i.e., the loss of previously learned knowledge. Among existing baselines, replay-based methods show competitive results but requires extra memory for storing exemplars, while exemplar-free (i.e., data need not be stored for replay in production) methods are resource friendly but often lack accuracy. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-free approach—Forward-only Online Analytic Learning (F-OAL). Unlike traditional methods, F-OAL does not rely on back-propagation and is forward-only, significantly reducing memory usage and computational time. Cooperating with a pre-trained frozen encoder with Feature Fusion, F-OAL only needs to update a linear classifier by recursive least square. This approach simultaneously achieves high accuracy and low resource consumption. Extensive experiments on bench mark datasets demonstrate F-OAL’s robust performance in OCIL scenarios.

Poster,Focus On What Matters: Separated Models For Visual-Based RL Generalization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93111,"Di Zhang, Bowen Lv, Hai Zhang, Feifan Yang, Junqiao Zhao, Hang Yu, Chang Huang, Hongtu Zhou, Chen Ye, changjun jiang","A primary challenge for visual-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) is to generalize effectively across unseen environments. Although previous studies have explored different auxiliary tasks to enhance generalization, few adopt image reconstruction due to concerns about exacerbating overfitting to task-irrelevant features during training. Perceiving the pre-eminence of image reconstruction in representation learning, we propose SMG (\blue{S}eparated \blue{M}odels for \blue{G}eneralization), a novel approach that exploits image reconstruction for generalization. SMG introduces two model branches to extract task-relevant and task-irrelevant representations separately from visual observations via cooperatively reconstruction. Built upon this architecture, we further emphasize the importance of task-relevant features for generalization. Specifically, SMG incorporates two additional consistency losses to guide the agent's focus toward task-relevant areas across different scenarios, thereby achieving free from overfitting. Extensive experiments in DMC demonstrate the SOTA performance of SMG in generalization, particularly excelling in video-background settings. Evaluations on robotic manipulation tasks further confirm the robustness of SMG in real-world applications. Source code is available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SMG/}."
Poster,FOOGD: Federated Collaboration for Both Out-of-distribution Generalization and Detection,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96103,"Xinting Liao, Weiming Liu, Pengyang Zhou, Fengyuan Yu, Jiahe Xu, Jun Wang, Wenjie Wang, Chaochao Chen, Xiaolin Zheng","Federated learning (FL) is a promising machine learning paradigm that collaborates with client models to capture global knowledge. However, deploying FL models in real-world scenarios remains unreliable due to the coexistence of in-distribution data and unexpected out-of-distribution (OOD) data, such as covariate-shift and semantic-shift data. Current FL researches typically address either covariate-shift data through OOD generalization or semantic-shift data via OOD detection, overlooking the simultaneous occurrence of various OOD shifts. In this work, we propose FOOGD, a method that estimates the probability density of each client and obtains reliable global distribution as guidance for the subsequent FL process. Firstly, SM3D in FOOGD estimates score model for arbitrary distributions without prior constraints, and detects semantic-shift data powerfully. Then SAG in FOOGD provides invariant yet diverse knowledge for both local covariate-shift generalization and client performance generalization. In empirical validations, FOOGD significantly enjoys three main advantages: (1) reliably estimating non-normalized decentralized distributions, (2) detecting semantic shift data via score values, and (3) generalizing to covariate-shift data by regularizing feature extractor. The project is open in https://github.com/XeniaLLL/FOOGD-main.git."
Poster,"Forgetting, Ignorance or Myopia: Revisiting Key Challenges in Online Continual Learning",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93601,"Wang Xinrui, Chuanxing Geng, Wenhai Wan, Shao-Yuan Li, Songcan Chen","Online continual learning (OCL) requires the models to learn from constant, endless streams of data. While significant efforts have been made in this field, most were focused on mitigating the \textit{catastrophic forgetting} issue to achieve better classification ability, at the cost of a much heavier training workload. They overlooked that in real-world scenarios, e.g., in high-speed data stream environments, data do not pause to accommodate slow models. In this paper, we emphasize that \textit{model throughput}-- defined as the maximum number of training samples that a model can process within a unit of time --  is equally important. It directly limits how much data a model can utilize and presents a challenging dilemma for current methods. With this understanding, we revisit key challenges in OCL from both empirical and theoretical perspectives, highlighting two critical issues beyond the well-documented catastrophic forgetting: (\romannumeral1) Model's ignorance: the single-pass nature of OCL challenges models to learn effective features within constrained training time and storage capacity, leading to a trade-off between effective learning and model throughput; (\romannumeral2) Model's myopia: the local learning nature of OCL on the current task leads the model to adopt overly simplified, task-specific features and \textit{excessively sparse classifier}, resulting in the gap between the optimal solution for the current task and the global objective. To tackle these issues, we propose the Non-sparse Classifier Evolution framework (NsCE) to facilitate effective global discriminative feature learning with minimal time cost. NsCE integrates non-sparse maximum separation regularization and targeted experience replay techniques with the help of pre-trained models, enabling rapid acquisition of new globally discriminative features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the substantial improvements of our framework in performance, throughput and real-world practicality."
Poster,Foundation Inference Models for Markov Jump Processes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94231,"David Berghaus, Kostadin Cvejoski, Patrick Seifner, César Ali Ojeda Marin, Ramsés J. Sánchez","Markov jump processes are continuous-time stochastic processes which describe dynamical systems evolving in discrete state spaces. These processes find wide application in the natural sciences and machine learning, but their inference is known to be far from trivial. In this work we introduce a methodology for *zero-shot inference* of Markov jump processes (MJPs), on bounded state spaces, from noisy and sparse observations, which consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over families of MJPs, as well as over possible observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we simulate a synthetic dataset of hidden MJPs and their noisy observations. Second, a neural recognition model that processes subsets of the simulated observations, and that is trained to output the initial condition and rate matrix of the target MJP in a supervised way. We empirically demonstrate that *one and the same* (pretrained) recognition model can infer, *in a zero-shot fashion*, hidden MJPs evolving in state spaces of different dimensionalities. Specifically, we infer MJPs which describe (i) discrete flashing ratchet systems, which are a type of Brownian motors, and the conformational dynamics in (ii) molecular simulations, (iii) experimental ion channel data and (iv) simple protein folding models. What is more, we show that our model performs on par with state-of-the-art models which are trained on the target datasets.Our pretrained model is available online."
Poster,Foundations of Multivariate Distributional Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94528,"Harley Wiltzer, Jesse Farebrother, Arthur Gretton, Mark Rowland","In reinforcement learning (RL), the consideration of multivariate reward signals has led to fundamental advancements in multi-objective decision-making, transfer learning, and representation learning. This work introduces the first oracle-free and computationally-tractable algorithms for provably convergent multivariate *distributional* dynamic programming and temporal difference learning. Our convergence rates match the familiar rates in the scalar reward setting, and additionally provide new insights into the fidelity of approximate return distribution representations as a function of the reward dimension. Surprisingly, when the reward dimension is larger than $1$, we show that standard analysis of categorical TD learning fails, which we resolve with a novel projection onto the space of mass-$1$ signed measures. Finally, with the aid of our technical results and simulations, we identify tradeoffs between distribution representations that influence the performance of multivariate distributional RL in practice."
Poster,Found in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts Better via Plug-and-Play Positional Encoding,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94207,"Zhenyu Zhang, Runjin Chen, Shiwei Liu, Zhewei Yao, Olatunji Ruwase, Beidi Chen, Xiaoxia Wu, Zhangyang &quot;Atlas&quot; Wang","This paper aims to overcome the ``lost-in-the-middle'' challenge of large language models (LLMs). While recent advancements have successfully enabled LLMs to perform stable language modeling with up to 4 million tokens, the persistent difficulty faced by most LLMs in identifying relevant information situated in the middle of the context has not been adequately tackled. To address this problem, this paper introduces Multi-scale Positional Encoding (Ms-PoE) which is a simple yet effective plug-and-play approach to enhance the capacity of LLMs to handle the relevant information located in the middle of the context, without fine-tuning or introducing any additional overhead. Ms-PoE leverages the position indice rescaling to relieve the long-term decay effect introduced by RoPE, while meticulously assigning distinct scaling ratios to different attention heads to preserve essential knowledge learned during the pre-training step, forming a multi-scale context fusion from short to long distance. Extensive experiments with a wide range of LLMs demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Notably, Ms-PoE achieves an average accuracy gain of up to 3.8 on the Zero-SCROLLS benchmark over the original LLMs. Code will be made public upon acceptence."
Poster,FouRA: Fourier Low-Rank Adaptation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93511,"Shubhankar Borse, Shreya Kadambi, Nilesh Pandey, Kartikeya Bhardwaj, Viswanath Ganapathy, Sweta Priyadarshi, Risheek Garrepalli, Rafael Esteves, Munawar Hayat, Fatih Porikli","While Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has proven beneficial for efficiently fine-tuning large models, LoRA fine-tuned text-to-image diffusion models lack diversity in the generated images, as the model tends to copy data from the observed training samples. This effect becomes more pronounced at higher values of adapter strength and for adapters with higher ranks which are fine-tuned on smaller datasets. To address these challenges, we present FouRA, a novel low-rank method that learns projections in the Fourier domain along with learning a flexible input-dependent adapter rank selection strategy. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we show that FouRA successfully solves the problems related to data copying and distribution collapse while significantly improving the generated image quality. We demonstrate that FouRA enhances the generalization of fine-tuned models thanks to its adaptive rank selection. We further show that the learned projections in the frequency domain are decorrelated and prove effective when merging multiple adapters. While FouRA is motivated for vision tasks, we also demonstrate its merits for language tasks on commonsense reasoning and GLUE benchmarks."
Poster,Fourier Amplitude and Correlation Loss: Beyond Using L2 Loss for Skillful Precipitation Nowcasting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96922,"Chiu-Wai Yan, Shi Quan Foo, Van Hoan Trinh, Dit-Yan Yeung, Ka-Hing Wong, Wai-kin Wong","Deep learning approaches have been widely adopted for precipitation nowcasting in recent years. Previous studies mainly focus on proposing new model architectures to improve pixel-wise metrics. However, they frequently result in blurry predictions which provide limited utility to forecasting operations. In this work, we propose a new Fourier Amplitude and Correlation Loss (FACL) which consists of two novel loss terms: Fourier Amplitude Loss (FAL) and Fourier Correlation Loss (FCL). FAL regularizes the Fourier amplitude of the model prediction and FCL complements the missing phase information. The two loss terms work together to replace the traditional L2 losses such as MSE and weighted MSE for the spatiotemporal prediction problem on signal-based data. Our method is generic, parameter-free and efficient. Extensive experiments using one synthetic dataset and three radar echo datasets demonstrate that our method improves perceptual metrics and meteorology skill scores, with a small trade-off to pixel-wise accuracy and structural similarity. Moreover, to improve the error margin in meteorological skill scores such as Critical Success Index (CSI) and Fractions Skill Score (FSS), we propose and adopt the Regional Histogram Divergence (RHD), a distance metric that considers the patch-wise similarity between signal-based imagery patterns with tolerance to local transforms."
