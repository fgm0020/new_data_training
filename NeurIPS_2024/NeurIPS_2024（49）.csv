Poster,BELM: Bidirectional Explicit Linear Multi-step Sampler for Exact Inversion in Diffusion Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94406,"Fangyikang Wang, Hubery Yin, Yue-Jiang Dong, Huminhao Zhu, zhang chao, Hanbin Zhao, Hui Qian, Chen Li","The inversion of diffusion model sampling, which aims to find the corresponding initial noise of a sample, plays a critical role in various tasks.Recently, several heuristic exact inversion samplers have been proposed to address the inexact inversion issue in a training-free manner. However, the theoretical properties of these heuristic samplers remain unknown and they often exhibit mediocre sampling quality.In this paper, we introduce a generic formulation, \emph{Bidirectional Explicit Linear Multi-step} (BELM) samplers, of the exact inversion samplers, which includes all previously proposed heuristic exact inversion samplers as special cases.The BELM formulation is derived from the variable-stepsize-variable-formula linear multi-step method via integrating a bidirectional explicit constraint. We highlight this bidirectional explicit constraint is the key of mathematically exact inversion.We systematically investigate the Local Truncation Error (LTE) within the BELM framework and show that the existing heuristic designs of exact inversion samplers yield sub-optimal LTE.Consequently, we propose the Optimal BELM (O-BELM) sampler through the LTE minimization approach.We conduct additional analysis to substantiate the theoretical stability and global convergence property of the proposed optimal sampler.Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our O-BELM sampler establishes the exact inversion property while achieving high-quality sampling.Additional experiments in image editing and image interpolation highlight the extensive  potential of applying O-BELM in varying applications."
Poster,Bench2Drive: Towards Multi-Ability Benchmarking of Closed-Loop End-To-End Autonomous Driving,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97436,"Xiaosong Jia, Zhenjie Yang, Qifeng Li, Zhiyuan Zhang, Junchi Yan","In an era marked by the rapid scaling of foundation models, autonomous driving technologies are approaching a transformative threshold where end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) emerges due to its potential of scaling up in the data-driven manner. However, existing E2E-AD methods are mostly evaluated under the open-loop log-replay manner with L2 errors and collision rate as metrics (e.g., in nuScenes), which could not fully reflect the driving performance of algorithms as recently acknowledged in the community. For those E2E-AD methods evaluated under the closed-loop protocol, they are tested in fixed routes (e.g., Town05Long and Longest6 in CARLA) with the driving score as metrics, which is known for high variance due to the unsmoothed metric function and large randomness in the long route. Besides, these methods usually collect their own data for training, which makes algorithm-level fair comparison infeasible.    To fulfill the paramount need of comprehensive, realistic, and fair testing environments for Full Self-Driving (FSD), we present Bench2Drive, the first benchmark for evaluating E2E-AD systems' multiple abilities in a closed-loop manner. Bench2Drive's official training data consists of 2 million fully annotated frames, collected from 10000 short clips uniformly distributed under 44 interactive scenarios (cut-in, overtaking, detour, etc), 23 weathers (sunny, foggy, rainy, etc), and 12 towns (urban, village, university, etc) in CARLA v2. Its evaluation protocol requires E2E-AD models to pass 44 interactive scenarios under different locations and weathers which sums up to 220 routes and thus provides a comprehensive and disentangled assessment about their driving capability under different situations. We implement state-of-the-art E2E-AD models and evaluate them in Bench2Drive, providing insights regarding current status and future directions."
Poster,Benchmark Data Repositories for Better Benchmarking,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97636,"Rachel Longjohn, Markelle Kelly, Sameer Singh, Padhraic Smyth","In machine learning research, it is common to evaluate algorithms via their performance on standard benchmark datasets. While a growing body of work establishes guidelines for---and levies criticisms at---data and benchmarking practices in machine learning, comparatively less attention has been paid to the data repositories where these datasets are stored, documented, and shared. In this paper, we analyze the landscape of these _benchmark data repositories_ and the role they can play in improving benchmarking. This role includes addressing issues with both datasets themselves (e.g., representational harms, construct validity) and the manner in which evaluation is carried out using such datasets (e.g., overemphasis on a few datasets and metrics, lack of reproducibility). To this end, we identify and discuss a set of considerations surrounding the design and use of benchmark data repositories, with a focus on improving benchmarking practices in machine learning."
Poster,Benchmarking Complex Instruction-Following with Multiple Constraints Composition,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97675,"Bosi Wen, Pei Ke, Xiaotao Gu, Lindong Wu, Hao Huang, Jinfeng Zhou, Wenchuang Li, Binxin Hu, Wendy Gao, Jiaxing Xu, Yiming Liu, Jie Tang, Hongning Wang, Minlie Huang","Instruction following is one of the fundamental capabilities of large language models (LLMs). As the ability of LLMs is constantly improving, they have been increasingly applied to deal with complex human instructions in real-world scenarios. Therefore, how to evaluate the ability of complex instruction-following of LLMs has become a critical research problem. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on modeling different types of constraints in human instructions while neglecting the composition of different constraints, which is an indispensable constituent in complex instructions. To this end, we propose ComplexBench, a benchmark for comprehensively evaluating the ability of LLMs to follow complex instructions composed of multiple constraints. We propose a hierarchical taxonomy for complex instructions, including 4 constraint types, 19 constraint dimensions, and 4 composition types, and manually collect a high-quality dataset accordingly. To make the evaluation reliable, we augment LLM-based evaluators with rules to effectively verify whether generated texts can satisfy each constraint and composition. Furthermore, we obtain the final evaluation score based on the dependency structure determined by different composition types. ComplexBench identifies significant deficiencies in existing LLMs when dealing with complex instructions with multiple constraints composition."
Poster,Benchmarking Counterfactual Image Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97876,"Thomas Melistas, Nikos Spyrou, Nefeli Gkouti, Pedro Sanchez, Athanasios Vlontzos, Yannis Panagakis, Giorgos Papanastasiou, Sotirios Tsaftaris","Generative AI has revolutionised visual content editing, empowering users to effortlessly modify images and videos. However, not all edits are equal. To perform realistic edits in domains such as natural image or medical imaging, modifications must respect causal relationships inherent to the data generation process. Such image editing falls into the counterfactual image generation regime. Evaluating counterfactual image generation is substantially complex: not only it lacks observable ground truths, but also requires adherence to causal constraints. Although several counterfactual image generation methods and evaluation metrics exist a comprehensive comparison within a unified setting is lacking. We present a comparison framework to thoroughly benchmark counterfactual image generation methods. We evaluate the performance of three conditional image generation model families developed within the Structural Causal Model (SCM) framework. We incorporate several metrics that assess diverse aspects of counterfactuals, such as composition, effectiveness, minimality of interventions, and image realism. We integrate all models that have been used for the task at hand and expand them to novel datasets and causal graphs, demonstrating the superiority of Hierarchical VAEs across most datasets and metrics. Our framework is implemented in a user-friendly Python package that can be extended to incorporate additional SCMs, causal methods, generative models, and datasets for the community to build on.

Poster,Benchmarking Estimators for Natural Experiments: A Novel Dataset and a Doubly Robust Algorithm,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97867,"R. Teal Witter, Christopher Musco","Estimating the effect of treatments from natural experiments, where treatments are pre-assigned, is an important and well-studied problem. We introduce a novel natural experiment dataset obtained from an early childhood literacy nonprofit. Surprisingly, applying over 20 established estimators to the dataset produces inconsistent results in evaluating the nonprofits efficacy. To address this, we create a benchmark to evaluate estimator accuracy using synthetic outcomes, whose design was guided by domain experts. The benchmark extensively explores performance as real world conditions like sample size, treatment correlation, and propensity score accuracy vary. Based on our benchmark, we observe that the class of doubly robust treatment effect estimators, which are based on simple and intuitive regression adjustment, generally outperform other more complicated estimators by orders of magnitude. To better support our theoretical understanding of doubly robust estimators, we derive a closed form expression for the variance of any such estimator that uses dataset splitting to obtain an unbiased estimate. This expression motivates the design of a new doubly robust estimator that uses a novel loss function when fitting functions for regression adjustment. We release the dataset and benchmark in a Python package; the package is built in a modular way to facilitate new datasets and estimators. https://github.com/rtealwitter/naturalexperiments"
Poster,Benchmarking Generative Models on Computational Thinking Tests in Elementary Visual Programming,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97500,"Victor-Alexandru Pădurean, Adish Singla","Generative models have demonstrated human-level proficiency in various benchmarks across domains like programming, natural sciences, and general knowledge. Despite these promising results on competitive benchmarks, they still struggle with seemingly simple problem-solving tasks typically carried out by elementary-level students. How do state-of-the-art models perform on standardized programming-related tests designed to assess computational thinking and problem-solving skills at schools? In this paper, we curate a novel benchmark involving computational thinking tests grounded in elementary visual programming domains. Our initial results show that state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Llama3 barely match the performance of an average school student. To further boost the performance of these models, we fine-tune them using a novel synthetic data generation methodology. The key idea is to develop a comprehensive dataset using symbolic methods that capture different skill levels, ranging from recognition of visual elements to multi-choice quizzes to synthesis-style tasks. We showcase how various aspects of symbolic information in synthetic data help improve fine-tuned models' performance. We will release the full implementation and datasets to facilitate further research on enhancing computational thinking in generative models."
Poster,Benchmarking LLMs via Uncertainty Quantification,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97746,"Fanghua Ye, Mingming Yang, Jianhui Pang, Longyue Wang, Derek Wong, Emine Yilmaz, Shuming Shi, Zhaopeng Tu","The proliferation of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) from various institutions has highlighted the urgent need for comprehensive evaluation methods. However, current evaluation platforms, such as the widely recognized HuggingFace open LLM leaderboard, neglect a crucial aspect -- uncertainty, which is vital for thoroughly assessing LLMs. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmarking approach for LLMs that integrates uncertainty quantification. Our examination involves nine LLMs (LLM series) spanning five representative natural language processing tasks. Our findings reveal that: I) LLMs with higher accuracy may exhibit lower certainty; II) Larger-scale LLMs may display greater uncertainty compared to their smaller counterparts; and III) Instruction-finetuning tends to increase the uncertainty of LLMs. These results underscore the significance of incorporating uncertainty in the evaluation of LLMs. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/smartyfh/LLM-Uncertainty-Bench."
Poster,Benchmarking Out-of-Distribution Generalization Capabilities of DNN-based Encoding Models for the Ventral Visual Cortex.,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97537,"Spandan Madan, Will Xiao, Mingran Cao, Hanspeter Pfister, Margaret Livingstone, Gabriel Kreiman","We characterized the generalization capabilities of deep neural network encoding models when predicting neuronal responses from the visual cortex to flashed images. We collected MacaqueITBench, a large-scale dataset of neuronal population responses from the macaque inferior temporal (IT) cortex to over $300,000$ images, comprising $8,233$ unique natural images presented to seven monkeys over $109$ sessions. Using MacaqueITBench, we investigated the impact of distribution shifts on models predicting neuronal activity by dividing the images into Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) train and test splits. The OOD splits included variations in image contrast, hue, intensity, temperature, and saturation. Compared to the performance on in-distribution test images---the conventional way in which these models have been evaluated---models performed worse at predicting neuronal responses to out-of-distribution images, retaining as little as $20\\%$ of the performance on in-distribution test images. Additionally, the relative ranking of different models in terms of their ability to predict neuronal responses changed drastically across OOD shifts. The generalization performance under OOD shifts can be well accounted by a simple image similarity metric---the cosine distance between image representations extracted from a pre-trained object recognition model is a strong predictor of neuronal predictivity under different distribution shifts. The dataset of images, neuronal firing rate recordings, and computational benchmarks are hosted publicly at: https://github.com/Spandan-Madan/benchmarking_ood_generalization_visual_cortex."
Poster,Benchmarking PtO and PnO Methods in the Predictive Combinatorial Optimization Regime,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97602,"Haoyu Geng, Hang Ruan, Runzhong Wang, Yang Li, YANG WANG, Lei Chen, Junchi Yan","Predictive combinatorial optimization, where the parameters of combinatorial optimization (CO) are unknown at the decision-making time, is the precise modeling of many real-world applications, including energy cost-aware scheduling and budget allocation on advertising. Tackling such a problem usually involves a prediction model and a CO solver. These two modules are integrated into the predictive CO pipeline following two design principles: ''Predict-then-Optimize (PtO)'', which learns predictions by supervised training and subsequently solves CO using predicted coefficients, while the other, named ''Predict-and-Optimize (PnO)'', directly optimizes towards the ultimate decision quality and claims to yield better decisions than traditional PtO approaches. However, there lacks a systematic benchmark of both approaches, including the specific design choices at the module level, as well as an evaluation dataset that covers representative real-world scenarios. To this end, we develop a modular framework to benchmark 11 existing PtO/PnO methods on 8 problems, including a new industrial dataset for combinatorial advertising that will be released. Our study shows that PnO approaches are better than PtO on 7 out of 8 benchmarks, but there is no silver bullet found for the specific design choices of PnO. A comprehensive categorization of current approaches and integration of typical scenarios are provided under a unified benchmark. Therefore, this paper could serve as a comprehensive benchmark for future PnO approach development and also offer fast prototyping for application-focused development.
