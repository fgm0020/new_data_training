Poster,Variational Flow Matching for Graph Generation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94958,"Floor Eijkelboom, Grigory Bartosh, Christian Andersson Naesseth, Max Welling, Jan-Willem van de Meent","We present a formulation of flow matching as variational inference, which we refer to as variational flow matching (VFM). We use this formulation to develop CatFlow, a flow matching method for categorical data that is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and achieves strong results on graph generation tasks. In VFM, the objective is to approximate the posterior probability path, which is a distribution over possible end points of a trajectory. VFM admits both the original flow matching objective and the CatFlow objective as special cases. We also relate VFM to score-based models, in which the dynamics are stochastic rather than deterministic, and derive a bound on the model likelihood based on a reweighted VFM objective. We evaluate CatFlow on one abstract graph generation task and two molecular generation tasks. In all cases, CatFlow exceeds or matches performance of the current state-of-the-art models."
Poster,Variational Multi-scale Representation for Estimating Uncertainty in 3D Gaussian Splatting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93472,"Ruiqi Li, Yiu-ming Cheung","Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become popular in reconstructing dense 3D representations of appearance and geometry. However, the learning pipeline in 3DGS inherently lacks the ability to quantify uncertainty, which is an important factor in applications like robotics mapping and navigation. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty estimation method built upon the Bayesian inference framework. Specifically, we propose a method to build variational multi-scale 3D Gaussians, where we leverage explicit scale information in 3DGS parameters to construct diversified parameter space samples. We develop an offset table technique to draw local multi-scale samples efficiently by offsetting selected attributes and sharing other base attributes. Then, the offset table is learned by variational inference with multi-scale prior. The learned offset posterior can quantify the uncertainty of each individual Gaussian component, and be used in the forward pass to infer the predictive uncertainty. Extensive experimental results on various benchmark datasets show that the proposed method provides well-aligned calibration performance on estimated uncertainty and better rendering quality compared with the previous methods that enable uncertainty quantification with view synthesis. Besides, by leveraging the model parameter uncertainty estimated by our method, we can remove noisy Gaussians automatically, thereby obtaining a high-fidelity part of the reconstructed scene, which is of great help in improving the visual quality."
Poster,Variation Spaces for Multi-Output Neural Networks: Insights on Multi-Task Learning and Network Compression,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/98328,"Joseph Shenouda, Rahul Parhi, Kangwook Lee, Robert Nowak","This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework for the analysis of vector-valued neural networks through the development of vector-valued variation spaces, a new class of reproducing kernel Banach spaces. These spaces emerge from studying the regularization effect of weight decay in training networks with activation functions like the rectified linear unit (ReLU). This framework offers a deeper understanding of multi-output networks and their function-space characteristics. A key contribution of this work is the development of a representer theorem for the vector-valued variation spaces. This representer theorem establishes that shallow vector-valued neural networks are the solutions to data-fitting problems over these infinite-dimensional spaces, where the network widths are bounded by the square of the number of training data. This observation reveals that the norm associated with these vector-valued variation spaces encourages the learning of features that are useful for multiple tasks, shedding new light on multi-task learning with neural networks. Finally, this paper develops a connection between weight-decay regularization and the multi-task lasso problem. This connection leads to novel bounds for layer widths in deep networks that depend on the intrinsic dimensions of the training data representations. This insight not only deepens the understanding of the deep network architectural requirements, but also yields a simple convex optimization method for deep neural network compression. The performance of this compression procedure is evaluated on various architectures."
Poster,VASA-1: Lifelike Audio-Driven Talking Faces Generated in Real Time,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96555,"Sicheng Xu, Guojun Chen, Yu-Xiao Guo, Jiaolong Yang, Chong Li, Zhenyu Zang, Yizhong Zhang, Xin Tong, Baining Guo","We introduce VASA, a framework for generating lifelike talking faces with appealing visual affective skills (VAS) given a single static image and a speech audio clip. Our premiere model, VASA-1, is capable of not only generating lip movements that are exquisitely synchronized with the audio, but also producing a large spectrum of facial nuances and natural head motions that contribute to the perception of authenticity and liveliness. The core innovations include a diffusion-based holistic facial dynamics and head movement generation model that works in a face latent space, and the development of such an expressive and disentangled face latent space using videos.Through extensive experiments including evaluation on a set of new metrics, we show that our method significantly outperforms previous methods along various dimensions comprehensively. Our method delivers high video quality with realistic facial and head dynamics and also supports the online generation of 512$\times$512 videos at up to 40 FPS with negligible starting latency.It paves the way for real-time engagements with lifelike avatars that emulate human conversational behaviors."
Poster,VastTrack: Vast Category Visual Object Tracking,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97849,"Liang Peng, Junyuan Gao, Xinran Liu, Weihong Li, Shaohua Dong, Zhipeng Zhang, Heng Fan, Libo Zhang","In this paper, we propose a novel benchmark, named VastTrack, aiming to facilitate the development of general visual tracking via encompassing abundant classes and videos. VastTrack consists of a few attractive properties: (1) Vast Object Category. In particular, it covers targets from 2,115 categories, significantly surpassing object classes of existing popular benchmarks (e.g., GOT-10k with 563 classes and LaSOT with 70 categories). Through providing such vast object classes, we expect to learn more general object tracking. (2) Larger scale. Compared with current benchmarks, VastTrack provides 50,610 videos with 4.2 million frames, which makes it to date the largest dataset in term of the number of videos, and hence could benefit training even more powerful visual trackers in the deep learning era. (3) Rich Annotation. Besides conventional bounding box annotations, VastTrack also provides linguistic descriptions with more than 50K sentences for the videos. Such rich annotations of VastTrack enable the development of both vision-only and vision-language tracking. In order to ensure precise annotation, each frame in the videos is manually labeled with multi-stage of careful inspections and refinements. To understand performance of existing trackers and to provide baselines for future comparison, we extensively evaluate 25 representative trackers. The results, not surprisingly, display significant drops compared to those on current datasets due to lack of abundant categories and videos from diverse scenarios for training, and more efforts are urgently required to improve general visual tracking. Our VastTrack, the toolkit, and evaluation results are publicly available at https://github.com/HengLan/VastTrack."
Poster,VB-LoRA: Extreme Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning with Vector Banks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93861,"Yang Li, Shaobo Han, Jonathan Shihao Ji","As the adoption of large language models increases and the need for per-user or per-task model customization grows, the parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its variants, incur substantial storage and transmission costs. To further reduce stored parameters, we introduce a ""divide-and-share"" paradigm that breaks the barriers of low-rank decomposition across matrix dimensions, modules, and layers by sharing  parameters globally via a vector bank. As an instantiation of the paradigm to LoRA, our proposed VB-LoRA composites all the low-rank matrices of LoRA from a shared vector bank with a differentiable top-$k$ admixture module. VB-LoRA achieves extreme parameter efficiency while maintaining comparable or better performance compared to state-of-the-art PEFT methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of VB-LoRA on natural language understanding, natural language generation, instruction tuning, and mathematical reasoning tasks. When fine-tuning the Llama2-13B model, VB-LoRA only uses 0.4% of LoRA's stored parameters, yet achieves superior results. Our source code is available at https://github.com/leo-yangli/VB-LoRA. This method has been merged into the Hugging Face PEFT package."
Poster,VCR-GauS: View Consistent Depth-Normal Regularizer for Gaussian Surface Reconstruction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94519,"Hanlin Chen, Fangyin Wei, Chen Li, Tianxin Huang, Yunsong Wang, Gim Hee Lee","Although 3D Gaussian Splatting has been widely studied because of its realistic and efficient novel-view synthesis, it is still challenging to extract a high-quality surface from the point-based representation. Previous works improve the surface by incorporating geometric priors from the off-the-shelf normal estimator. However, there are two main limitations: 1) Supervising normal rendered from 3D Gaussians updates only the rotation parameter while neglecting other geometric parameters; 2) The inconsistency of predicted normal maps across multiple views may lead to severe reconstruction artifacts. In this paper, we propose a Depth-Normal regularizer that directly couples normal with other geometric parameters, leading to full updates of the geometric parameters from normal regularization. We further propose a confidence term to mitigate inconsistencies of normal predictions across multiple views. Moreover, we also introduce a densification and splitting strategy to regularize the size and distribution of 3D Gaussians for more accurate surface modeling. Compared with Gaussian-based baselines, experiments show that our approach obtains better reconstruction quality and maintains competitive appearance quality at faster training speed and 100+ FPS rendering. Our code will be made open-source upon paper acceptance."
Poster,Vector Quantization Prompting for Continual Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96275,"Li Jiao, Qiuxia LAI, YU LI, Qiang Xu","Continual learning requires to overcome catastrophic forgetting when training a single model on a sequence of tasks.   Recent top-performing approaches are prompt-based methods that utilize a set of learnable parameters (i.e., prompts) to encode task knowledge, from which appropriate ones are selected to guide the fixed pre-trained model in generating features tailored to a certain task. However, existing methods rely on predicting prompt identities for prompt selection, where the identity prediction process cannot be optimized with task loss. This limitation leads to sub-optimal prompt selection and inadequate adaptation of pre-trained features for a specific task. Previous efforts have tried to address this by directly generating prompts from input queries instead of selecting from a set of candidates. However, these prompts are continuous, which lack sufficient abstraction for task knowledge representation, making them less effective for continual learning. To address these challenges, we propose VQ-Prompt, a prompt-based continual learning method that incorporates Vector Quantization (VQ) into end-to-end training of a set of discrete prompts.  In this way, VQ-Prompt can optimize the prompt selection process with task loss and meanwhile achieve effective abstraction of task knowledge for continual learning. Extensive experiments show that VQ-Prompt outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning methods across a variety of benchmarks under the challenging class-incremental setting."
Poster,VeLoRA: Memory Efficient Training using Rank-1 Sub-Token Projections,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94503,"Roy Miles, Pradyumna Reddy, Ismail Elezi, Jiankang Deng","Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for tackling many language-processing tasks. Despite their success, training and fine-tuning these models is still far too computationally and memory intensive. In this paper, we identify and characterise the important components needed for effective model convergence using gradient descent. In doing so we find that the intermediate activations used to implement backpropagation can be excessively compressed without incurring any degradation in performance. This result leads us to a cheap and memory-efficient algorithm for both fine-tuning and pre-training LLMs. The proposed algorithm simply divides the tokens up into smaller sub-tokens before projecting them onto a fixed 1-dimensional subspace during the forward pass. These features are then coarsely reconstructed during the backward pass to implement the update rules. We confirm the effectiveness of our algorithm as being complimentary to many state-of-the-art PEFT methods on the VTAB-1k fine-tuning benchmark. Furthermore, we outperform QLoRA for fine-tuning LLaMA and show competitive performance against other memory-efficient pre-training methods on the large-scale C4 dataset."
Poster,Verifiably Robust Conformal Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96567,"Linus Jeary, Tom Kuipers, Mehran Hosseini, Nicola Paoletti","Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular uncertainty quantification method that provides distribution-free, statistically valid prediction sets, assuming that training and test data are exchangeable. In such a case, CP's prediction sets are guaranteed to cover the (unknown) true test output with a user-specified probability. Nevertheless, this guarantee is violated when the data is subjected to adversarial attacks, which often result in a significant loss of coverage. Recently, several approaches have been put forward to recover CP guarantees in this setting. These approaches leverage variations of randomised smoothing to produce conservative sets which account for the effect of the adversarial perturbations. They are, however, limited in that they only support $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations and classification tasks. This paper introduces VRCP (Verifiably Robust Conformal Prediction), a new framework that leverages recent neural network verification methods to recover coverage guarantees under adversarial attacks. Our VRCP method is the first to support perturbations bounded by arbitrary norms including $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, and $\ell_\infty$, as well as regression tasks. We evaluate and compare our approach on image classification tasks (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet) and regression tasks for deep reinforcement learning environments. In every case, VRCP achieves above nominal coverage and yields significantly more efficient and informative prediction regions than the SotA."
