Poster,SciCode: A Research Coding Benchmark Curated by Scientists,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97822,"Minyang Tian, Luyu Gao, Shizhuo Zhang, Xinan Chen, Cunwei Fan, Xuefei Guo, Roland Haas, Pan Ji, Kittithat Krongchon, Yao Li, Shengyan Liu, Di Luo, Yutao Ma, HAO TONG, Kha Trinh, Chenyu Tian, Zihan Wang, Bohao Wu, Shengzhu Yin, Minhui Zhu, Kilian Lieret, Yanxin Lu, Genglin Liu, Yufeng Du, Tianhua Tao, Ofir Press, Jamie Callan, Eliu Huerta, Hao Peng","Since language models (LMs) now outperform average humans on many challenging tasks, it is becoming increasingly difficult to develop challenging, high-quality, and realistic evaluations. We address this by examining LM capabilities to generate code for solving real scientific research problems. Incorporating input from scientists and AI researchers in 16 diverse natural science sub-fields, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science, we create a scientist-curated coding benchmark, SciCode. The problems naturally factorize into multiple subproblems, each involving knowledge recall, reasoning, and code synthesis. In total, SciCode contains 338 subproblems decomposed from 80 challenging main problems, and it offers optional descriptions specifying useful scientific background information and scientist-annotated gold-standard solutions and test cases for evaluation. OpenAI o1-preview, the best-performing model among those tested, can solve only 7.7\% of the problems in the most realistic setting. We believe that SciCode demonstrates both contemporary LMs' progress towards realizing helpful scientific assistants and sheds light on the building and evaluation of scientific AI in the future."
Poster,SciFIBench: Benchmarking Large Multimodal Models for Scientific Figure Interpretation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97770,"Jonathan Roberts, Kai Han, Neil Houlsby, Samuel Albanie","Large multimodal models (LMMs) have proven flexible and generalisable across many tasks and fields. Although they have strong potential to aid scientific research, their capabilities in this domain are not well characterised. A key aspect of scientific research is the ability to understand and interpret figures, which serve as a rich, compressed source of complex information. In this work, we present SciFIBench, a scientific figure interpretation benchmark consisting of 2000 questions split between two tasks across 8 categories. The questions are curated from arXiv paper figures and captions, using adversarial filtering to find hard negatives and human verification forquality control. We evaluate 28 LMMs on SciFIBench, finding it to be a challenging benchmark. Finally, we investigate the alignment and reasoning faithfulness of the LMMs on augmented question sets from our benchmark. We release SciFIBench to encourage progress in this domain."
Poster,SciInstruct: a Self-Reflective Instruction Annotated Dataset for Training Scientific Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97744,"Dan Zhang, Ziniu Hu, Sining Zhoubian, Zhengxiao Du, Kaiyu Yang, Zihan Wang, Yisong Yue, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in assisting scientific discovery. However, such applications are currently limited by LLMs' deficiencies in understanding intricate scientific concepts, deriving symbolic equations, and solving advanced numerical calculations. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SciInstruct, a suite of scientific instructions for training scientific language models capable of college-level scientific reasoning. Central to our approach is a novel self-reflective instruction annotation framework to address the data scarcity challenge in the science domain. This framework leverages existing LLMs to generate step-by-step reasoning for unlabelled scientific questions, followed by a process of self-reflective critic-and-revise. Applying this framework, we curated a diverse and high-quality dataset encompassing physics, chemistry, math, and formal proofs. We analyze the curated SciInstruct from multiple interesting perspectives (e.g., domain, scale, source, question type, answer length, etc.). To verify the effectiveness of SciInstruct, we fine-tuned different language models with SciInstruct, i.e., ChatGLM3 (6B and 32B), Llama3-8B-Instruct, and Mistral-7B: MetaMath, enhancing their scientific and mathematical reasoning capabilities, without sacrificing the language understanding capabilities of the base model. We release all codes and SciInstruct at https://github.com/THUDM/SciGLM."
Poster,Score-based 3D molecule generation with neural fields,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96296,"Matthieu Kirchmeyer, Pedro O. Pinheiro, Saeed Saremi","We introduce a new representation for 3D molecules based on their continuous atomic density fields. Using this representation, we propose a new model based on walk-jump sampling for unconditional 3D molecule generation in the continuous space using neural fields. Our model, FuncMol, encodes molecular fields into latent codes using a conditional neural field, samples noisy codes from a Gaussian-smoothed distribution with Langevin MCMC (walk), denoises these samples in a single step (jump), and finally decodes them into molecular fields. FuncMol performs all-atom generation of 3D molecules without assumptions on the molecular structure and scales well with the size of molecules, unlike most approaches. Our method achieves competitive results on drug-like molecules and easily scales to macro-cyclic peptides, with at least one order of magnitude faster sampling. The code is available at https://github.com/prescient-design/funcmol."
Poster,Score-based generative models are provably robust: an uncertainty quantification perspective,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95673,"Nikiforos Mimikos-Stamatopoulos, Benjamin Zhang, Markos Katsoulakis","Through an uncertainty quantification (UQ) perspective, we show that score-based generative models (SGMs) are provably robust to the multiple sources of error in practical implementation. Our primary tool is the Wasserstein uncertainty propagation (WUP) theorem, a *model-form UQ* bound that describes how the $L^2$ error from learning the score function propagates to a Wasserstein-1 ($\mathbf{d}_1$) ball around the true data distribution under the evolution of the Fokker-Planck equation. We show how errors due to (a) finite sample approximation, (b) early stopping, (c) score-matching objective choice, (d) score function parametrization expressiveness, and (e) reference distribution choice, impact the quality of the generative model in terms of a $\mathbf{d}_1$ bound of computable quantities. The WUP theorem relies on Bernstein estimates for Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equations (PDE) and the regularizing properties of diffusion processes. Specifically, *PDE regularity theory* shows that *stochasticity* is the key mechanism ensuring SGM algorithms are provably robust. The WUP theorem applies to integral probability metrics beyond $\mathbf{d}_1$, such as the total variation distance and the maximum mean discrepancy. Sample complexity and generalization bounds in $\mathbf{d}_1$ follow directly from the WUP theorem. Our approach requires minimal assumptions, is agnostic to the manifold hypothesis and avoids absolute continuity assumptions for the target distribution. Additionally, our results clarify the *trade-offs* among multiple error sources in SGMs."
Poster,Score Distillation via Reparametrized DDIM,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96682,"Artem Lukoianov, Haitz Sáez de Ocáriz Borde, Kristjan Greenewald, Vitor Guizilini, Timur Bagautdinov, Vincent Sitzmann, Justin Solomon","While 2D diffusion models generate realistic, high-detail images, 3D shape generation methods like Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)  built on these 2D diffusion models  produce cartoon-like, over-smoothed shapes. To help explain this discrepancy, we show that the image guidance used in Score Distillation can be understood as the velocity field of a 2D denoising generative process, up to the choice of a noise term. In particular, after a change of variables, SDS resembles a high-variance version of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) with a differently-sampled noise term: SDS introduces noise i.i.d. randomly at each step, while DDIM infers it from the previous noise predictions. This excessive variance can lead to over-smoothing and unrealistic outputs. We show that a better noise approximation can be recovered by inverting DDIM in each SDS update step. This modification makes SDS's generative process for 2D images almost identical to DDIM. In 3D, it removes over-smoothing, preserves higher-frequency detail, and brings the generation quality closer to that of 2D samplers. Experimentally, our method achieves better or similar 3D generation quality compared to other state-of-the-art Score Distillation methods, all without training additional neural networks or multi-view supervision, and providing useful insights into relationship between 2D and 3D asset generation with diffusion models."
Poster,Score-Optimal Diffusion Schedules,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96901,"Christopher Williams, Andrew Campbell, Arnaud Doucet, Saifuddin Syed","Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) offer a flexible framework for sampling from high dimensional data distributions. DDMs generate a path of probability distributions interpolating between a reference Gaussian distribution and a data distribution by incrementally injecting noise into the data. To numerically simulate the sampling process, a discretisation schedule from the reference back towards clean data must be chosen. An appropriate discretisation schedule is crucial to obtain high quality samples. However, beyond hand crafted heuristics, a general method for choosing this schedule remains elusive. This paper presents a novel algorithm for adaptively selecting an optimal discretisation schedule with respect to a cost that we derive. Our cost measures the work done by the simulation procedure to transport samples from one point in the diffusion path to the next. Our method does not require hyperparameter tuning and adapts to the dynamics and geometry of the diffusion path. Our algorithm only involves the evaluation of the estimated Stein score, making it scalable to existing pre-trained models at inference time and online during training. We find that our learned schedule recovers performant schedules previously only discovered through manual search and obtains competitive FID scores on image datasets."
Poster,SCOREQ: Speech Quality Assessment with Contrastive Regression,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95846,"Alessandro Ragano, Jan Skoglund, Andrew Hines","In this paper, we present SCOREQ, a novel approach for speech quality prediction. SCOREQ is a triplet loss function for contrastive regression that addresses the domain generalisation shortcoming exhibited by state of the art no-reference speech quality metrics. In the paper we: (i) illustrate the problem of L2 loss training failing at capturing the continuous nature of the mean opinion score (MOS) labels; (ii) demonstrate the lack of generalisation through a benchmarking evaluation across several speech domains; (iii) outline our approach and explore the impact of the architectural design decisions through incremental evaluation; (iv) evaluate the final model against state of the art models for a wide variety of data and domains.  The results show that the lack of generalisation observed in state of the art speech quality metrics is addressed by SCOREQ. We conclude that using a triplet loss function for contrastive regression improves generalisation for speech quality prediction models but also has potential utility across a wide range of applications using regression-based predictive models."
Poster,Scribbles for All: Benchmarking Scribble Supervised Segmentation Across Datasets,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97672,"Wolfgang Boettcher, Lukas Hoyer, Ozan Unal, Jan Eric Lenssen, Bernt Schiele","In this work, we introduce *Scribbles for All*, a label and training data generation algorithm for semantic segmentation trained on scribble labels. Training or fine-tuning semantic segmentation models with weak supervision has become an important topic recently and was subject to significant advances in model quality. In this setting, scribbles are a promising label type to achieve high quality segmentation results while requiring a much lower annotation effort than usual pixel-wise dense semantic segmentation annotations. The main limitation of scribbles as source for weak supervision is the lack of challenging datasets for scribble segmentation, which hinders the development of novel methods and conclusive evaluations. To overcome this limitation, *Scribbles for All* provides scribble labels for several popular segmentation datasets and provides an algorithm to automatically generate scribble labels for any dataset with dense annotations, paving the way for new insights and model advancements in the field of weakly supervised segmentation. In addition to providing datasets and algorithm, we evaluate state-of-the-art segmentation models on our datasets and show that models trained with our synthetic labels perform competitively with respect to models trained on manual labels. Thus, our datasets enable state-of-the-art research into methods for scribble-labeled semantic segmentation. The datasets, scribble generation algorithm, and baselines are publicly available at https://github.com/wbkit/Scribbles4All."
Poster,"SCRREAM : SCan, Register, REnder And Map: A Framework for Annotating Accurate and Dense 3D Indoor Scenes with a Benchmark",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97725,"HyunJun Jung, Weihang Li, Shun-Cheng Wu, William Bittner, Nikolas Brasch, Jifei Song, Eduardo Pérez-Pellitero, Zhensong Zhang, Arthur Moreau, Nassir Navab, Benjamin Busam","Traditionally, 3d indoor datasets have generally prioritized scale over ground-truth accuracy in order to obtain improved generalization. However, using these datasets to evaluate dense geometry tasks, such as depth rendering, can be problematic as the meshes of the dataset are often incomplete and may produce wrong ground truth to evaluate the details. In this paper, we propose SCRREAM, a dataset annotation framework that allows annotation of fully dense meshes of objects in the scene and registers camera poses on the real image sequence, which can produce accurate ground truth for both sparse 3D as well as dense 3D tasks. We show the details of the dataset annotation pipeline and showcase four possible variants of datasets that can be obtained from our framework with example scenes, such as indoor reconstruction and SLAM, scene editing \& object removal, human reconstruction and 6d pose estimation. Recent pipelines for indoor reconstruction and SLAM serve as new benchmarks. In contrast to previous indoor dataset, our design allows to evaluate dense geometry tasks on eleven sample scenes against accurately rendered ground truth depth maps."
