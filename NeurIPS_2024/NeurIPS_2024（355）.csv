Poster,Scalable DP-SGD: Shuffling vs. Poisson Subsampling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96505,"Lynn Chua, Badih Ghazi, Pritish Kamath, Ravi Kumar, Pasin Manurangsi, Amer Sinha, Chiyuan Zhang","We provide new lower bounds on the privacy guarantee of _multi-epoch_ Adaptive Batch Linear Queries (ABLQ) mechanism with _shuffled batch sampling_, demonstrating substantial gaps when compared to _Poisson subsampling_; prior analysis was limited to a single epoch.Since the privacy analysis of Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is obtained by analyzing the ABLQ mechanism, this brings into serious question the common practice of implementing Shuffling based DP-SGD, but reporting privacy parameters as if Poisson subsampling was used.To understand the impact of this gap on the utility of trained machine learning models, we introduce a novel practical approach to implement Poisson subsampling _at scale_ using massively parallel computation, and efficiently train models with the same.We provide a comparison between the utility of models trained with Poisson subsampling based DP-SGD, and the optimistic estimates of utility when using shuffling, via our new lower bounds on the privacy guarantee of ABLQ with shuffling."
Poster,Scalable Early Childhood Reading Performance Prediction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97781,"Zhongkai Shangguan, Zanming Huang, Eshed Ohn-Bar, Ola Ozernov-Palchik, Derek Kosty, Michael Stoolmiller, Hank Fien","Models for student reading performance can empower educators and institutions to proactively identify at-risk students, thereby enabling early and tailored instructional interventions. However, there are no suitable publicly available educational datasets for modeling and predicting future reading performance. In this work, we introduce the Enhanced Core Reading Instruction (ECRI) dataset, a novel large-scale longitudinal tabular dataset collected across 44 schools with 6,916 students and 172 teachers. We leverage the dataset to empirically evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art machine learning models to recognize early childhood educational patterns in multivariate and partial measurements. Specifically, we demonstrate a simple self-supervised strategy in which a Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) network is pre-trained over masked inputs to outperform several strong baselines while generalizing over diverse educational settings. To facilitate future developments in precise modeling and responsible use of models for individualized and early intervention strategies, our data and code are available at https://ecri-data.github.io/."
Poster,Scalable Kernel Inverse Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95494,"Youyuan Long, Tolga Ok, Pedro Zattoni Scroccaro, Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani","Inverse Optimization (IO) is a framework for learning the unknown objective function of an expert decision-maker from a past dataset.In this paper, we extend the hypothesis class of IO objective functions to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), thereby enhancing feature representation to an infinite-dimensional space.We demonstrate that a variant of the representer theorem holds for a specific training loss, allowing the reformulation of the problem as a finite-dimensional convex optimization program.To address scalability issues commonly associated with kernel methods, we propose the Sequential Selection Optimization (SSO) algorithm to efficiently train the proposed Kernel Inverse Optimization (KIO) model.Finally, we validate the generalization capabilities of the proposed KIO model and the effectiveness of the SSO algorithm through learning-from-demonstration tasks on the MuJoCo benchmark."
Poster,Scalable Neural Network Verification with Branch-and-bound Inferred Cutting Planes,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95939,"Duo Zhou, Christopher Brix, Grani A. Hanasusanto, Huan Zhang","Recently, cutting-plane methods such as GCP-CROWN have been explored to enhance neural network verifiers and made significant advancements. However, GCP-CROWN currently relies on ${\it generic}$ cutting planes (""cuts"") generated from external mixed integer programming (MIP) solvers. Due to the poor scalability of MIP solvers, large neural networks cannot benefit from these cutting planes. In this paper, we exploit the structure of the neural network verification problem to generate efficient and scalable cutting planes ${\it specific}$ to this problem setting. We propose a novel approach, Branch-and-bound Inferred Cuts with COnstraint Strengthening (BICCOS), that leverages the logical relationships of neurons within verified subproblems in the branch-and-bound search tree, and we introduce cuts that preclude these relationships in other subproblems. We develop a mechanism that assigns influence scores to neurons in each path to allow the strengthening of these cuts. Furthermore, we design a multi-tree search technique to identify more cuts, effectively narrowing the search space and accelerating the BaB algorithm. Our results demonstrate that BICCOS can generate hundreds of useful cuts during the branch-and-bound process and consistently increase the number of verifiable instances compared to other state-of-the-art neural network verifiers on a wide range of benchmarks, including large networks that previous cutting plane methods could not scale to."
Poster,Scalable Optimization in the Modular Norm,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95114,"Tim Large, Yang Liu, Jacob Huh, Hyojin Bahng, Phillip Isola, Jeremy Bernstein","To improve performance in contemporary deep learning, one is interested in scaling up the neural network in terms of both the number and the size of the layers. When ramping up the width of a single layer, graceful scaling of training has been linked to the need to normalize the weights and their updates in the ""natural norm"" particular to that layer. In this paper, we significantly generalize this idea by defining the modular norm, which is the natural norm on the full weight space of any neural network architecture. The modular norm is defined recursively in tandem with the network architecture itself. We show that the modular norm has several promising applications. On the practical side, the modular norm can be used to normalize the updates of any base optimizer so that the learning rate becomes transferable across width and depth. This means that the user does not need to compute optimizer-specific scale factors in order to scale training. On the theoretical side, we show that for any neural network built from ""well-behaved"" atomic modules, the gradient of the network is Lipschitz-continuous in the modular norm, with the Lipschitz constant admitting a simple recursive formula. This characterization opens the door to porting standard ideas in optimization theory over to deep learning. We have created a Python package called Modula that automatically normalizes weight updates in the modular norm of the architecture. Both the Modula package and code for our experiments are provided in the supplementary material."
Poster,Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96382,"Ioannis Kalogeropoulos, Giorgos Bouritsas, Yannis Panagakis","This paper pertains to an emerging machine learning paradigm: learning higher- order functions, i.e. functions whose inputs are functions themselves, particularly when these inputs are Neural Networks (NNs). With the growing interest in architectures that process NNs, a recurring design principle has permeated the field: adhering to the permutation symmetries arising from the connectionist structure ofNNs. However, are these the sole symmetries present in NN parameterizations? Zooming into most practical activation functions (e.g. sine, ReLU, tanh) answers this question negatively and gives rise to intriguing new symmetries, which we collectively refer to as scaling symmetries, that is, non-zero scalar multiplications and divisions of weights and biases. In this work, we propose Scale Equivariant Graph MetaNetworks - ScaleGMNs, a framework that adapts the Graph Metanetwork (message-passing) paradigm by incorporating scaling symmetries and thus rendering neuron and edge representations equivariant to valid scalings. We introduce novel building blocks, of independent technical interest, that allow for equivariance or invariance with respect to individual scalar multipliers or their product and use them in all components of ScaleGMN. Furthermore, we prove that, under certain expressivity conditions, ScaleGMN can simulate the forward and backward pass of any input feedforward neural network. Experimental results demonstrate that our method advances the state-of-the-art performance for several datasets and activation functions, highlighting the power of scaling symmetries as an inductive bias for NN processing.

Poster,Scale-invariant Optimal Sampling for Rare-events Data and Sparse Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96526,"Jing Wang, HaiYing Wang, Hao Zhang","Subsampling is effective in tackling computational challenges for massive data with rare events.  Overly aggressive subsampling may adversely affect estimation efficiency, and optimal subsampling is essential to mitigate the information loss. However, existing optimal subsampling probabilities depends on data scales, and some scaling transformations may result in inefficient subsamples. This problem is more significant when there are inactive features, because their influence on the subsampling probabilities can be arbitrarily magnified by inappropriate scaling transformations. We tackle this challenge and introduce a scale-invariant optimal subsampling function in the context of sparse models, where inactive features are commonly assumed. Instead of focusing on estimating model parameters, we define an optimal subsampling function to minimize the prediction error,  using adaptive lasso as an example to outline the estimation procedure and study its theoretical guarantee.  We first introduce the adaptive lasso estimator for rare-events data and establish its oracle properties, thereby validating the use of subsampling. Then we derive a scale-invariant optimal subsampling function that minimizes the prediction error of the inverse probability weighted (IPW) adaptive lasso.  Finally, we present an estimator based on the maximum sampled conditional likelihood (MSCL) to further improve the estimation efficiency. We conduct numerical experiments using both simulated and real-world data sets to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods."
Poster,ScaleKD: Strong Vision Transformers Could Be Excellent Teachers,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96927,"Jiawei Fan, Chao Li, Xiaolong Liu, Anbang Yao","In this paper, we question if well pre-trained vision transformer (ViT) models could be used as teachers that exhibit scalable properties to advance cross architecture knowledge distillation research, in the context of adopting mainstream large-scale visual recognition datasets for evaluation. To make this possible, our analysis underlines the importance of seeking effective strategies to align (1) feature computing paradigm differences, (2) model scale differences, and (3) knowledge density differences. By combining three closely coupled components namely *cross attention projector*, *dual-view feature mimicking* and *teacher parameter perception* tailored to address the alignment problems stated above, we present a simple and effective knowledge distillation method, called *ScaleKD*. Our method can train student backbones that span across a variety of convolutional neural network (CNN), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and ViT architectures on image classification datasets, achieving state-of-the-art knowledge distillation performance. For instance, taking a well pre-trained Swin-L as the teacher model, our method gets 75.15\%|82.03\%|84.16\%|78.63\%|81.96\%|83.93\%|83.80\%|85.53\%  top-1 accuracies for MobileNet-V1|ResNet-50|ConvNeXt-T|Mixer-S/16|Mixer-B/16|ViT-S/16|Swin-T|ViT-B/16 models trained on ImageNet-1K dataset from scratch, showing 3.05\%|3.39\%|2.02\%|4.61\%|5.52\%|4.03\%|2.62\%|3.73\% absolute gains to the individually trained counterparts. Intriguingly, when scaling up the size of teacher models or their pre-training datasets, our method showcases the desired scalable properties, bringing increasingly larger gains to student models. We also empirically show that the student backbones trained by our method transfer well on downstream MS-COCO and ADE20K datasets. More importantly, our method could be used as a more efficient alternative to the time-intensive pre-training paradigm for any target student model on large-scale datasets if a strong pre-trained ViT is available, reducing the amount of viewed training samples up to 195$\times$.

Poster,Scaling Continuous Latent Variable Models as Probabilistic Integral Circuits,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95649,"Gennaro Gala, Cassio de Campos, Antonio Vergari, Erik Quaeghebeur","Probabilistic integral circuits (PICs) have been recently introduced as probabilistic models enjoying the key ingredient behind expressive generative models: continuous latent variables (LVs). PICs are symbolic computational graphs defining continuous LV models as hierarchies of functions that are summed and multiplied together, or integrated over some LVs. They are tractable if LVs can be analytically integrated out, otherwise they can be approximated by tractable probabilistic circuits (PC) encoding a hierarchical numerical quadrature process, called QPCs.So far, only tree-shaped PICs have been explored, and training them via numerical quadrature requires memory-intensive processing at scale. In this paper, we address these issues, and present: (i) a pipeline for building DAG-shaped PICs out of arbitrary variable decompositions, (ii) a procedure for training PICs using tensorized circuit architectures, and (iii) neural functional sharing techniques to allow scalable training. In extensive experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of functional sharing and the superiority of QPCs over traditional PCs."
Poster,Scaling Law for Time Series Forecasting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96119,"Jingzhe Shi, Qinwei Ma, Huan Ma, Lei Li","Scaling law that rewards large datasets, complex models and enhanced data granularity has been observed in various fields of deep learning. Yet, studies on time series forecasting have cast doubt on scaling behaviors of deep learning methods for time series forecasting: while more training data improves performance, more capable models do not always outperform less capable models, and longer input horizon may hurt performance for some models. We propose a theory for scaling law for time series forecasting that can explain these seemingly abnormal behaviors. We take into account the impact of dataset size and model complexity, as well as time series data granularity, particularly focusing on the look-back horizon, an aspect that has been unexplored in previous theories. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate various models using a diverse set of time series forecasting datasets, which (1) verifies the validity of scaling law on dataset size and model complexity within the realm of time series forecasting, and (2) validates our theoretical framework, particularly regarding the influence of look back horizon. We hope our findings may inspire new models targeting time series forecasting datasets of limited size, as well as large foundational datasets and models for time series forecasting in future works."
