Poster,Facilitating Multimodal Classification via Dynamically Learning Modality Gap,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95223,"Yang Yang, Fengqiang Wan, Qing-Yuan Jiang, Yi Xu","Multimodal learning falls into the trap of the optimization dilemma due to the modality imbalance phenomenon, leading to unsatisfactory performance in real applications. A core reason for modality imbalance is that the models of each modality converge at different rates. Many attempts naturally focus on adjusting learning procedures adaptively. Essentially, the reason why models converge at different rates is because the difficulty of fitting category labels is inconsistent for each modality during learning. From the perspective of fitting labels, we find that appropriate positive intervention label fitting can correct this difference in learning ability. By exploiting the ability of contrastive learning to intervene in the learning of category label fitting, we propose a novel multimodal learning approach that dynamically integrates unsupervised contrastive learning and supervised multimodal learning to address the modality imbalance problem. We find that a simple yet heuristic integration strategy can significantly alleviate the modality imbalance phenomenon. Moreover, we design a learning-based integration strategy to integrate two losses dynamically, further improving the performance. Experiments on widely used datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) multimodal learning approaches.

Poster,FACT or Fiction: Can Truthful Mechanisms Eliminate Federated Free Riding?,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95703,"Marco Bornstein, Amrit Singh Bedi, Abdirisak Mohamed, Furong Huang","Standard federated learning (FL) approaches are vulnerable to the free-rider dilemma: participating agents can contribute little to nothing yet receive a well-trained aggregated model. While prior mechanisms attempt to solve the free-rider dilemma, none have addressed the issue of truthfulness. In practice, adversarial agents can provide false information to the server in order to cheat its way out of contributing to federated training. In an effort to make free-riding-averse federated mechanisms truthful, and consequently less prone to breaking down in practice, we propose FACT. FACT is the first federated mechanism that: (1) eliminates federated free riding by using a penalty system, (2) ensures agents provide truthful information by creating a competitive environment, and (3) encourages agent participation by offering better performance than training alone. Empirically, FACT avoids free-riding when agents are untruthful, and reduces agent loss by over 4x."
Poster,Factorized Diffusion Architectures for Unsupervised Image Generation and Segmentation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96467,"Xin Yuan, Michael Maire","We develop a neural network architecture which, trained in an unsupervised manner as a denoising diffusion model, simultaneously learns to both generate and segment images.  Learning is driven entirely by the denoising diffusion objective, without any annotation or prior knowledge about regions during training.  A computational bottleneck, built into the neural architecture, encourages the denoising network to partition an input into regions, denoise them in parallel, and combine the results.  Our trained model generates both synthetic images and, by simple examination of its internal predicted partitions, semantic segmentations of those images.  Without fine-tuning, we directly apply our unsupervised model to the downstream task of segmenting real images via noising and subsequently denoising them.  Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves accurate unsupervised image segmentation and high-quality synthetic image generation across multiple datasets."
Poster,FactorizePhys: Matrix Factorization for Multidimensional Attention in Remote Physiological Sensing,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93470,"Jitesh Joshi, Sos Agaian, Youngjun Cho","Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables non-invasive extraction of blood volume pulse signals through imaging, transforming spatial-temporal data into time series signals. Advances in end-to-end rPPG approaches have focused on this transformation where attention mechanisms are crucial for feature extraction. However, existing methods compute attention disjointly across spatial, temporal, and channel dimensions. Here, we propose the Factorized Self-Attention Module (FSAM), which jointly computes multidimensional attention from voxel embeddings using nonnegative matrix factorization. To demonstrate FSAM's effectiveness, we developed FactorizePhys, an end-to-end 3D-CNN architecture for estimating blood volume pulse signals from raw video frames. Our approach adeptly factorizes voxel embeddings to achieve comprehensive spatial, temporal, and channel attention, enhancing performance of generic signal extraction tasks. Furthermore, we deploy FSAM within an existing 2D-CNN-based rPPG architecture to illustrate its versatility. FSAM and FactorizePhys are thoroughly evaluated against state-of-the-art rPPG methods, each representing different types of architecture and attention mechanism. We perform ablation studies to investigate the architectural decisions and hyperparameters of FSAM. Experiments on four publicly available datasets and intuitive visualization of learned spatial-temporal features substantiate the effectiveness of FSAM and enhanced cross-dataset generalization in estimating rPPG signals, suggesting its broader potential as a multidimensional attention mechanism.

Poster,FactorSim: Generative Simulation via Factorized Representation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93169,"Fan-Yun Sun, Harini S I, Angela Yi, Yihan Zhou, Alex Zook, Jonathan Tremblay, Logan Cross, Jiajun Wu, Nick Haber","Generating simulations to train intelligent agents in game-playing and robotics from natural language input, user input, or task documentation remains an open-ended challenge. Existing approaches focus on parts of this challenge, such as generating reward functions or task hyperparameters. Unlike previous work, we introduce FACTORSIM that generates full simulations in code from language input that can be used to train agents. Exploiting the structural modularity specific to coded simulations, we propose to use a factored partially observable Markov decision process representation that allows us to reduce context dependence during each step of the generation. For evaluation, we introduce a generative simulation benchmark that assesses the generated simulation code’s accuracy and effectiveness in facilitating zero-shot transfers in reinforcement learning settings. We show that FACTORSIM outperforms existing methods in generating simulations regarding prompt alignment (i.e., accuracy), zero-shot transfer abilities, and human evaluation. We also demonstrate its effectiveness in generating robotic tasks."
Poster,Fair Allocation in Dynamic Mechanism Design,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94504,"Alireza Fallah, Michael Jordan, Annie Ulichney","We consider a dynamic mechanism design problem where an auctioneer sells an indivisible good to two groups of buyers in every round, for a total of $T$ rounds. The auctioneer aims to maximize their discounted overall revenue while adhering to a fairness constraint that guarantees a minimum average allocation for each group. We begin by studying the static case ($T=1$) and establish that the optimal mechanism involves two types of subsidization: one that increases the overall probability of allocation to all buyers, and another that favors the group which otherwise has a lower probability of winning the item. We then extend our results to the dynamic case by characterizing a set of recursive functions that determine the optimal allocation and payments in each round. Notably, our results establish that in the dynamic case, the seller, on one hand, commits to a participation reward to incentivize truth-telling, and, on the other hand, charges an entry fee for every round. Moreover, the optimal allocation once more involves subsidization in favor of one group, where the extent of subsidization depends on the difference in future utilities for both the seller and buyers when allocating the item to one group versus the other. Finally, we present an approximation scheme to solve the recursive equations and determine an approximately optimal and fair allocation efficiently."
Poster,Fair and Welfare-Efficient Constrained Multi-Matchings under Uncertainty,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96532,"Elita Lobo, Justin Payan, Cyrus Cousins, Yair Zick","We study fair allocation of constrained resources, where a market designer optimizes overall welfare while maintaining group fairness. In many large-scale settings, utilities are not known in advance, but are instead observed after realizing the allocation. We therefore estimate agent utilities using machine learning. Optimizing over estimates requires trading-off between mean utilities and their predictive variances. We discuss these trade-offs under two paradigms for preference modeling – in the stochastic optimization regime, the market designer has access to a probability distribution over utilities, and in the robust optimization regime they have access to an uncertainty set containing the true utilities with high probability. We discuss utilitarian and egalitarian welfare objectives, and we explore how to optimize for them under stochastic and robust paradigms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approaches on three publicly available conference reviewer assignment datasets. The approaches presented enable scalable constrained resource allocation under uncertainty for many combinations of objectives and preference models."
Poster,Fair Bilevel Neural Network (FairBiNN): On Balancing fairness and accuracy via Stackelberg Equilibrium,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94300,"Mehdi Yazdani-Jahromi, Ali Khodabandeh Yalabadi, Amirarsalan Rajabi, Aida Tayebi, Ivan Garibay, OZLEM GARIBAY","The persistent challenge of bias in machine learning models necessitates robust solutions to ensure parity and equal treatment across diverse groups, particularly in classification tasks. Current methods for mitigating bias often result in information loss and an inadequate balance between accuracy and fairness. To address this, we propose a novel methodology grounded in bilevel optimization principles. Our deep learning-based approach concurrently optimizes for both accuracy and fairness objectives, and under certain assumptions, achieving proven Pareto optimal solutions while mitigating bias in the trained model. Theoretical analysis indicates that the upper bound on the loss incurred by this method is less than or equal to the loss of the Lagrangian approach, which involves adding a regularization term to the loss function. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model primarily on tabular datasets such as UCI Adult and Heritage Health. When benchmarked against state-of-the-art fairness methods, our model exhibits superior performance, advancing fairness-aware machine learning solutions and bridging the accuracy-fairness gap. The implementation of FairBiNN is available on https://github.com/yazdanimehdi/FairBiNN."
Poster,Fair GLASSO: Estimating Fair Graphical Models with Unbiased Statistical Behavior,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94593,"Madeline Navarro, Samuel Rey, Andrei Buciulea, Antonio G. Marques, Santiago Segarra","We propose estimating Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) that are fair with respect to sensitive nodal attributes. Many real-world models exhibit unfair discriminatory behavior due to biases in data. Such discrimination is known to be exacerbated when data is equipped with pairwise relationships encoded in a graph. Additionally, the effect of biased data on graphical models is largely underexplored. We thus introduce fairness for graphical models in the form of two bias metrics to promote balance in statistical similarities across nodal groups with different sensitive attributes. Leveraging these metrics, we present Fair GLASSO, a regularized graphical lasso approach to obtain sparse Gaussian precision matrices with unbiased statistical dependencies across groups. We also propose an efficient proximal gradient algorithm to obtain the estimates. Theoretically, we express the tradeoff between fair and accurate estimated precision matrices. Critically, this includes demonstrating when accuracy can be preserved in the presence of a fairness regularizer. On top of this, we study the complexity of Fair GLASSO and demonstrate that our algorithm enjoys a fast convergence rate. Our empirical validation includes synthetic and real-world simulations that illustrate the value and effectiveness of our proposed optimization problem and iterative algorithm."
Poster,FairJob: A Real-World Dataset for Fairness in Online Systems,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97523,"Mariia Vladimirova, Federico Pavone, Eustache Diemert","We introduce a fairness-aware dataset for job recommendation in advertising, designed to foster research in algorithmic fairness within real-world scenarios. It was collected and prepared to comply with privacy standards and business confidentiality. An additional challenge is the lack of access to protected user attributes such as gender, for which we propose a pragmatic solution to obtain a proxy estimate. Despite being anonymized and including a proxy for a sensitive attribute, our dataset preserves predictive power and maintains a realistic and challenging benchmark. This dataset addresses a significant gap in the availability of fairness-focused resources for high-impact domains like advertising -- the actual impact being having access or not to precious employment opportunities, where balancing fairness and utility is a common industrial challenge. We also explore various stages in the advertising process where unfairness can occur and introduce a method to compute a fair utility metric for the job recommendations in online systems case from a biased dataset. Experimental evaluations of bias mitigation techniques on the released dataset demonstrate potential improvements in fairness and the associated trade-offs with utility.The dataset is hosted at https://huggingface.co/datasets/criteo/FairJob.
