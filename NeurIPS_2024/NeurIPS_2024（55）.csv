Poster,Black-Box Forgetting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93800,"Yusuke Kuwana, Yuta Goto, Takashi Shibata, Go Irie","Large-scale pre-trained models (PTMs) provide remarkable zero-shot classification capability covering a wide variety of object classes. However, practical applications do not always require the classification of all kinds of objects, and leaving the model capable of recognizing unnecessary classes not only degrades overall accuracy but also leads to operational disadvantages. To mitigate this issue, we explore the selective forgetting problem for PTMs, where the task is to make the model unable to recognize only the specified classes, while maintaining accuracy for the rest. All the existing methods assume ''white-box'' settings, where model information such as architectures, parameters, and gradients is available for training. However, PTMs are often ''black-box,'' where information on such models is unavailable for commercial reasons or social responsibilities. In this paper, we address a novel problem of selective forgetting for black-box models, named Black-Box Forgetting, and propose an approach to the problem. Given that information on the model is unavailable, we optimize the input prompt to decrease the accuracy of specified classes through derivative-free optimization. To avoid difficult high-dimensional optimization while ensuring high forgetting performance, we propose Latent Context Sharing, which introduces common low-dimensional latent components among multiple tokens for the prompt. Experiments on four standard benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method with reasonable baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/yusukekwn/Black-Box-Forgetting."
Poster,BLAST: Block-Level Adaptive Structured Matrices for Efficient Deep Neural Network Inference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93718,"Changwoo Lee, Soo Min Kwon, Qing Qu, Hun-Seok Kim","Large-scale foundation models have demonstrated exceptional performance in language and vision tasks. However, the numerous dense matrix-vector operations involved in these large networks pose significant computational challenges during inference. To address these challenges, we introduce the Block-Level Adaptive STructured (BLAST) matrix, designed to learn and leverage efficient structures prevalent in the weight matrices of linear layers within deep learning models. Compared to existing structured matrices, the BLAST matrix offers substantial flexibility, as it can represent various types of structures that are either learned from data or computed from pre-existing weight matrices. We demonstrate the efficiency of using the BLAST matrix for compressing both language and vision tasks, showing that (i) for medium-sized models such as ViT and GPT-2, training with BLAST weights boosts performance while reducing complexity by 70\% and 40\%, respectively; and (ii) for large foundation models such as Llama-7B and DiT-XL, the BLAST matrix achieves a 2x compression while exhibiting the lowest performance degradation among all tested structured matrices. Our code is available at https://github.com/changwoolee/BLAST."
Poster,BLEnD: A Benchmark for LLMs on Everyday Knowledge in Diverse Cultures and Languages,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97510,"Junho Myung, Nayeon Lee, Yi Zhou, Jiho Jin, Rifki Putri, Dimosthenis Antypas, Hsuvas Borkakoty, Eunsu Kim, Carla Perez-Almendros, Abinew Ali Ayele, Victor Gutierrez Basulto, Yazmin Ibanez-Garcia, Hwaran Lee, Shamsuddeen H Muhammad, Kiwoong Park, Anar Rzayev, Nina White, Seid Muhie Yimam, Mohammad Taher Pilehvar, Nedjma Ousidhoum, Jose Camacho-Collados, Alice Oh","Large language models (LLMs) often lack culture-specific everyday knowledge, especially across diverse regions and non-English languages. Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' cultural sensitivities are usually limited to a single language or online sources like Wikipedia, which may not reflect the daily habits, customs, and lifestyles of different regions. That is, information about the food people eat for their birthday celebrations, spices they typically use, musical instruments youngsters play or the sports they practice in school is not always explicitly written online. To address this issue, we introduce BLEnD, a hand-crafted benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' everyday knowledge across diverse cultures and languages. The benchmark comprises 52.6k question-answer pairs from 16 countries/regions, in 13 different languages, including low-resource ones such as Amharic, Assamese, Azerbaijani, Hausa, and Sundanese. We evaluate LLMs in two formats: short-answer questions, and multiple-choice questions. We show that LLMs perform better in cultures that are more present online, with a maximum 57.34% difference in GPT-4, the best-performing model, in the short-answer format.Furthermore, we find that LLMs perform better in their local languages for mid-to-high-resource languages. Interestingly, for languages deemed to be low-resource, LLMs provide better answers in English. We make our dataset publicly available at: https://github.com/nlee0212/BLEnD."
Poster,Blind Image Restoration via Fast Diffusion Inversion,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95812,"Hamadi Chihaoui, Abdelhak Lemkhenter, Paolo Favaro","Image Restoration (IR) methods based on a pre-trained diffusion model have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, they have two fundamental limitations: 1) they often assume that the degradation operator is completely known and 2) they alter the diffusion sampling process, which may result in restored images that do not lie onto the data manifold. To address these issues, we propose Blind Image Restoration via fast Diffusion inversion (BIRD) a blind IR method that jointly optimizes for the degradation model parameters and the restored image. To ensure that the restored images lie onto the data manifold, we propose a novel sampling technique on a pre-trained diffusion model. A key idea in our method is not to modify the reverse sampling, i.e., not to alter all the intermediate latents, once an initial noise is sampled. This is ultimately equivalent to casting the IR task as an optimization problem in the space of the input noise. Moreover, to mitigate the computational cost associated with inverting a fully unrolled diffusion model, we leverage the inherent capability of these models to skip ahead in the forward diffusion process using large time steps. We experimentally validate BIRD on several image restoration tasks and show that it achieves state of the art performance."
Poster,BLoB: Bayesian Low-Rank Adaptation by Backpropagation for Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95507,"Yibin Wang, Haizhou Shi, Ligong Han, Dimitris Metaxas, Hao Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from overconfidence during inference, particularly when adapted to downstream domain-specific tasks with limited data. Previous work addresses this issue by employing approximate Bayesian estimation after the LLMs are trained, enabling them to quantify uncertainty. However, such post-training approaches' performance is severely limited by the parameters learned during training. In this paper, we go beyond post-training Bayesianization and propose Bayesian Low-Rank Adaptation by Backpropagation (BLoB), an algorithm that continuously and jointly adjusts both the mean and covariance of LLM parameters throughout the whole fine-tuning process. Our empirical results verify the effectiveness of BLoB in terms of generalization and uncertainty estimation, when evaluated on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data."
Poster,Block Sparse Bayesian Learning: A Diversified Scheme,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94591,"Yanhao Zhang, Zhihan Zhu, Yong Xia","This paper introduces a novel prior called Diversified Block Sparse Prior to characterize the widespread block sparsity phenomenon in real-world data. By allowing diversification on intra-block variance and inter-block correlation matrices, we effectively address the sensitivity issue of existing block sparse  learning methods to pre-defined block information, which enables adaptive block estimation while mitigating the risk of overfitting. Based on this, a diversified block sparse Bayesian learning method (DivSBL) is proposed, utilizing EM algorithm and dual ascent method for hyperparameter estimation. Moreover, we establish the global and local optimality theory of our model. Experiments validate the advantages of DivSBL over existing algorithms."
Poster,Block Transformer: Global-to-Local Language Modeling for Fast Inference,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96498,"Namgyu Ho, Sangmin Bae, Taehyeon Kim, Hyunjik Jo, Yireun Kim, Tal Schuster, Adam Fisch, James Thorne, Se-Young Yun","We introduce the Block Transformer which adopts hierarchical global-to-local modeling to autoregressive transformers to mitigate the inference bottlenecks associated with self-attention. Self-attention requires the key-value (KV) cache of all previous sequences to be retrieved from memory at every decoding step to retrieve context information, leading to two primary bottlenecks during batch inference. First, there is a significant delay in obtaining the first token, as the information of the entire prompt must first be processed to prefill the KV cache. Second, computation of subsequent tokens is bottlenecked by the high memory I/O demand of fetching the entire KV cache, which grows linearly with sequence length, incurring quadratic memory reads overall. We design the Block Transformer to strategically mitigate these costs, by incorporating coarsity and locality into an integrated global-to-local architecture. At the lower layers, we aggregate tokens into fixed size blocks to apply attention across the entire sequence at coarse-grained detail, to capture the global context while minimizing KV cache overhead. At upper layers, we apply attention within each block to decode individual tokens, to model fine-grained details with a lightweight local KV cache. We pretrain vanilla and Block Transformers from scratch and demonstrate that Block Transformers reach 10--20x inference throughput compared to vanilla transformers with equivalent perplexity and zero-shot task performance."
Poster,BLURD: Benchmarking and Learning using a Unified Rendering and Diffusion Model,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97576,"Boris Repasky, Ehsan Abbasnejad, Anthony Dick","Recent advancements in pre-trained vision models have made them pivotal in computer vision, emphasizing the need for their thorough evaluation and benchmarking. This evaluation needs to consider various factors of variation, their potential biases, shortcuts, and inaccuracies that ultimately lead to disparate performance in models. Such evaluations are conventionally done using either synthetic data from 2D or 3D rendering software or real-world images in controlled settings. Synthetic methods offer full control and flexibility, while real-world methods are limited by high costs and less adaptability. Moreover, 3D rendering can't yet fully replicate real photography, creating a realism gap.In this paper, we introduce BLURD--Benchmarking and Learning using a Unified Rendering and Diffusion Model--a novel method combining 3D rendering and Stable Diffusion to bridge this gap in representation learning. With BLURD we create a new family of datasets that allow for the creation of both 3D rendered and photo-realistic images with identical factors. BLURD, therefore, provides deeper insights into the representations learned by various CLIP backbones. The source code for creating the BLURD datasets is available at https://github.com/squaringTheCircle/BLURD"
Poster,B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95153,"Luca Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Sharad Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, Alessandro Achille, Stefano Soatto","We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span ('context' in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory 'in-context,' permanent structural memory 'in-weights,' fading memory 'in-state,' and long-term eidetic memory 'in-storage' by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we test whether models trained inductively on a-priori bounded sequences (up to 8K tokens) can still perform transductive inference on sequences many-fold longer. B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training."
Poster,BMRS: Bayesian Model Reduction for Structured Pruning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93862,"Dustin Wright, Christian Igel, Raghavendra Selvan","Modern neural networks are often massively overparameterized leading to high compute costs during training and at inference. One effective method to improve both the compute and energy efficiency of neural networks while maintaining good performance is structured pruning, where full network structures (e.g. neurons or convolutional filters) that have limited impact on the model output are removed. In this work, we propose Bayesian Model Reduction for Structured pruning (BMRS), a fully end-to-end Bayesian method of structured pruning. BMRS is based on two recent methods: Bayesian structured pruning with multiplicative noise, and Bayesian model reduction (BMR), a method which allows efficient comparison of Bayesian models under a change in prior. We present two realizations of BMRS derived from different priors which yield different structured pruning characteristics:  1) BMRS_N with the truncated log-normal prior, which offers reliable compression rates and accuracy without the need for tuning any thresholds and 2) BMRS_U with the truncated log-uniform prior that can achieve more aggressive compression based on the boundaries of truncation. Overall, we find that BMRS offers a theoretically grounded approach to structured pruning of neural networks yielding both high compression rates and accuracy. Experiments on multiple datasets and neural networks of varying complexity showed that the two BMRS methods offer a competitive performance-efficiency trade-off compared to other pruning methods."
