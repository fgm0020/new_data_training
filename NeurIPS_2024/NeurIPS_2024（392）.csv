Poster,Synthetic Programming Elicitation for Text-to-Code in Very Low-Resource Programming and Formal Languages,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93893,"Federico Mora, Justin Wong, Haley Lepe, Sahil Bhatia, Karim Elmaaroufi, George Varghese, Joseph Gonzalez, Elizabeth Polgreen, Sanjit Seshia","Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for code applications have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot fluency and instruction following on challenging code related tasks ranging from test case generation to self-repair. Unsurprisingly, however, models struggle to compose syntactically valid programs in programming languages unrepresented in pre-training, referred to as very low-resource Programming Languages (VLPLs). VLPLs appear in crucial settings, including domain-specific languages for internal tools, tool-chains for legacy languages, and formal verification frameworks. Inspired by a technique called natural programming elicitation, we propose designing an intermediate language that LLMs ``naturally'' know how to use and which can be automatically compiled to a target VLPL. When LLMs generate code that lies outside of this intermediate language, we use compiler techniques to repair the code into programs in the intermediate language. Overall, we introduce _synthetic programming elicitation and compilation_ (SPEAC), an approach that enables LLMs to generate syntactically valid code even for VLPLs. We empirically evaluate the performance of SPEAC in a case study for the UCLID5 formal verification language and find that, compared to existing retrieval and fine-tuning baselines, SPEAC produces syntactically correct programs more frequently and without sacrificing semantic correctness."
Poster,T2VSafetyBench: Evaluating the Safety of Text-to-Video Generative Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97732,"Yibo Miao, Yifan Zhu, Lijia Yu, Jun Zhu, Xiao-Shan Gao, Yinpeng Dong","The recent development of Sora leads to a new era in text-to-video (T2V) generation. Along with this comes the rising concern about its safety risks. The generated videos may contain illegal or unethical content, and there is a lack of comprehensive quantitative understanding of their safety, posing a challenge to their reliability and practical deployment. Previous evaluations primarily focus on the quality of video generation. While some evaluations of text-to-image models have considered safety, they cover limited aspects and do not address the unique temporal risk inherent in video generation. To bridge this research gap, we introduce T2VSafetyBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for conducting safety-critical assessments of text-to-video models. We define 4 primary categories with 14 critical aspects of video generation safety and construct a malicious prompt dataset including real-world prompts, LLM-generated prompts, and jailbreak attack-based prompts. We then conduct a thorough safety evaluation on 9 recently released T2V models. Based on our evaluation results, we draw several important findings, including: 1) no single model excels in all aspects, with different models showing various strengths; 2) the correlation between GPT-4 assessments and manual reviews is generally high; 3) there is a trade-off between the usability and safety of text-to-video generative models. This indicates that as the field of video generation rapidly advances, safety risks are set to surge, highlighting the urgency of prioritizing video safety. We hope that T2VSafetyBench can provide insights for better understanding the safety of video generation in the era of generative AIs. Our code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/yibo-miao/T2VSafetyBench}."
Poster,T2Vs Meet VLMs: A Scalable Multimodal Dataset for Visual Harmfulness Recognition,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97879,"Chen Yeh, You-Ming Chang, Wei-Chen Chiu, Ning Yu","While widespread access to the Internet and the rapid advancement of generative models boost people's creativity and productivity, the risk of encountering inappropriate or harmful content also increases. To address the aforementioned issue, researchers managed to incorporate several harmful contents datasets with machine learning methods to detect harmful concepts. However, existing harmful datasets are curated by the presence of a narrow range of harmful objects, and only cover real harmful content sources. This restricts the generalizability of methods based on such datasets and leads to the potential misjudgment in certain cases. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive and extensive harmful dataset, **VHD11K**, consisting of 10,000 images and 1,000 videos, crawled from the Internet and generated by 4 generative models, across a total of 10 harmful categories covering a full spectrum of harmful concepts with non-trival definition. We also propose a novel annotation framework by formulating the annotation process as a multi-agent Visual Question Answering (VQA) task, having 3 different VLMs ""debate"" about whether the given image/video is harmful, and incorporating the in-context learning strategy in the debating process. Therefore, we can ensure that the VLMs consider the context of the given image/video and both sides of the arguments thoroughly before making decisions, further reducing the likelihood of misjudgments in edge cases. Evaluation and experimental results demonstrate that (1) the great alignment between the annotation from our novel annotation framework and those from human, ensuring the reliability of VHD11K;(2) our full-spectrum harmful dataset successfully identifies the inability of existing harmful content detection methods to detect extensive harmful contents and improves the performance of existing harmfulness recognition methods;(3) our dataset outperforms the baseline dataset, SMID, as evidenced by the superior improvement in harmfulness recognition methods.The entire dataset is publicly available: https://huggingface.co/datasets/denny3388/VHD11K"
Poster,T2V-Turbo: Breaking the Quality Bottleneck of Video Consistency Model with Mixed Reward Feedback,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96616,"Jiachen Li, Weixi Feng, Tsu-Jui Fu, Xinyi Wang, S Basu, Wenhu Chen, William Yang Wang","Diffusion-based text-to-video (T2V) models have achieved significant success but continue to be hampered by the slow sampling speed of their iterative sampling processes. To address the challenge, consistency models have been proposed to facilitate fast inference, albeit at the cost of sample quality. In this work, we aim to break the quality bottleneck of a video consistency model (VCM) to achieve **both fast and high-quality video generation**. We introduce T2V-Turbo, which integrates feedback from a mixture of differentiable reward models into the consistency distillation (CD) process of a pre-trained T2V model. Notably, we directly optimize rewards associated with single-step generations that arise naturally from computing the CD loss, effectively bypassing the memory constraints imposed by backpropagating gradients through an iterative sampling process. Remarkably, the 4-step generations from our T2V-Turbo achieve the highest total score on VBench, even surpassing Gen-2 and Pika. We further conduct human evaluations to corroborate the results, validating that the 4-step generations from our T2V-Turbo are preferred over the 50-step DDIM samples from their teacher models, representing more than a tenfold acceleration while improving video generation quality."
Poster,TabEBM: A Tabular Data Augmentation Method with Distinct Class-Specific Energy-Based Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95948,"Andrei Margeloiu, Xiangjian Jiang, Nikola Simidjievski, Mateja Jamnik","Data collection is often difficult in critical fields such as medicine, physics, and chemistry, yielding typically only small tabular datasets. However, classification methods tend to struggle with these small datasets, leading to poor predictive performance. Increasing the training set with additional synthetic data, similar to data augmentation in images, is commonly believed to improve downstream tabular classification performance. However, current tabular generative methods that learn either the joint distribution $ p(\mathbf{x}, y) $ or the class-conditional distribution $ p(\mathbf{x} \mid y) $ often overfit on small datasets, resulting in poor-quality synthetic data, usually worsening classification performance compared to using real data alone. To solve these challenges, we introduce TabEBM, a novel class-conditional generative method using Energy-Based Models (EBMs). Unlike existing tabular methods that use a shared model to approximate all class-conditional densities, our key innovation is to create distinct EBM generative models for each class, each modelling its class-specific data distribution individually. This approach creates robust energy landscapes, even in ambiguous class distributions. Our experiments show that TabEBM generates synthetic data with higher quality and better statistical fidelity than existing methods. When used for data augmentation, our synthetic data consistently leads to improved classification performance across diverse datasets of various sizes, especially small ones.

Poster,TableRAG: Million-Token Table Understanding with Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96701,"Si-An Chen, Lesly Miculicich, Julian Eisenschlos, Zifeng Wang, Zilong Wang, Yanfei Chen, YASUHISA FUJII, Hsuan-Tien Lin, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister","Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have notably enhanced their ability to reason with tabular data, primarily through program-aided mechanisms that manipulate and analyze tables.However, these methods often require the entire table as input, leading to scalability challenges due to the positional bias or context length constraints.In response to these challenges, we introduce TableRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework specifically designed for LM-based table understanding.TableRAG leverages query expansion combined with schema and cell retrieval to pinpoint crucial information  before providing it to the LMs.This enables more efficient data encoding and precise retrieval, significantly reducing prompt lengths and mitigating information loss.We have developed two new million-token benchmarks from the Arcade and BIRD-SQL datasets to thoroughly evaluate TableRAG's effectiveness at scale.Our results demonstrate that TableRAG's retrieval design achieves the highest retrieval quality, leading to the new state-of-the-art performance on large-scale table understanding."
Poster,TabPedia: Towards Comprehensive Visual Table Understanding with Concept Synergy,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94530,"Weichao Zhao, Hao Feng, Qi Liu, Jingqun Tang, Binghong Wu, Lei Liao, Shu Wei, Yongjie Ye, Hao Liu, Wengang Zhou, Houqiang Li, Can Huang","Tables contain factual and quantitative data accompanied by various structures and contents that pose challenges for machine comprehension. Previous methods generally design task-specific architectures and objectives for individual tasks, resulting in modal isolation and intricate workflows. In this paper, we present a novel large vision-language model, TabPedia, equipped with a concept synergy mechanism. In this mechanism, all the involved diverse visual table understanding (VTU) tasks and multi-source visual embeddings are abstracted as concepts. This unified framework allows TabPedia to seamlessly integrate VTU tasks, such as table detection, table structure recognition, table querying, and table question answering, by leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Moreover, the concept synergy mechanism enables table perception-related and comprehension-related tasks to work in harmony, as they can effectively leverage the needed clues from the corresponding source perception embeddings. Furthermore, to better evaluate the VTU task in real-world scenarios, we establish a new and comprehensive table VQA benchmark, ComTQA, featuring approximately 9,000 QA pairs. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on both table perception and comprehension tasks, conducted across various public benchmarks, validate the effectiveness of our TabPedia. The superior performance further confirms the feasibility of using LLMs for understanding visual tables when all concepts work in synergy. The benchmark ComTQA has been open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ByteDance/ComTQA. The source code and model also have been released at https://github.com/zhaowc-ustc/TabPedia."
Poster,TabularBench: Benchmarking Adversarial Robustness for Tabular Deep Learning in Real-world Use-cases,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97710,"Thibault Simonetto, Salah GHAMIZI, Maxime Cordy","While adversarial robustness in computer vision is a mature research field, fewer researchers have tackled the evasion attacks against tabular deep learning, and even fewer investigated robustification mechanisms and reliable defenses. We hypothesize that this lag in the research on tabular adversarial attacks is in part due to the lack of standardized benchmarks. To fill this gap, we propose TabularBench, the first comprehensive benchmark of robustness of tabular deep learning classification models. We evaluated adversarial robustness with CAA, an ensemble of gradient and search attacks which was recently demonstrated as the most effective attack against a tabular model. In addition to our open benchmark https://github.com/serval-uni-lu/tabularbench where we welcome submissions of new models and defenses, we implement 7 robustification mechanisms inspired by state-of-the-art defenses in computer vision and propose the largest benchmark of robust tabular deep learning over 200 models across five critical scenarios in finance, healthcare and security. We curated real datasets for each use case, augmented with hundreds of thousands of realistic synthetic inputs, and trained and assessed our models with and without data augmentations. We open-source our library that provides API access to all our pre-trained robust tabular models, and the largest datasets of real and synthetic tabular inputs. Finally, we analyze the impact of various defenses on the robustness and provide actionable insights to design new defenses and robustification mechanisms."
Poster,Tackling Uncertain Correspondences for Multi-Modal Entity Alignment,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95783,"Liyi Chen, Ying Sun, Shengzhe Zhang, Yuyang Ye, Wei Wu, Hui Xiong","Recently, multi-modal entity alignment has emerged as a pivotal endeavor for the integration of Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) originating from diverse data sources. Existing works primarily focus on fully depicting entity features by designing various modality encoders or fusion approaches. However, uncertain correspondences between inter-modal or intra-modal cues, such as weak inter-modal associations, description diversity, and modality absence, still severely hinder the effective exploration of aligned entity similarities. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Tackling uncertain correspondences method for Multi-modal Entity Alignment (TMEA). Specifically, to handle diverse attribute knowledge descriptions, we design alignment-augmented abstract representation that incorporates the large language model and in-context learning into attribute alignment and filtering for generating and embedding the attribute abstract. In order to mitigate the influence of the modality absence, we propose to unify all modality features into a shared latent subspace and generate pseudo features via variational autoencoders according to existing modal features. Then, we develop an inter-modal commonality enhancement mechanism based on cross-attention with orthogonal constraints, to address weak semantic associations between modalities. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of TMEA with a clear improvement over competitive baselines."
Poster,TACT: Advancing Complex Aggregative Reasoning with Information Extraction Tools,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97749,"Avi Caciularu, Alon Jacovi, Eyal Ben-David, Sasha Goldshtein, Tal Schuster, Jonathan Herzig, Gal Elidan, Amir Globerson","Large Language Models (LLMs) often do not perform well on queries that require the aggregation of information across texts. To better evaluate this setting and facilitate modeling efforts, we introduce TACT - Text And Calculations through Tables, a dataset crafted to evaluate LLMs' reasoning and computational abilities using complex instructions. TACT contains challenging instructions that demand stitching information scattered across one or more texts, and performing complex integration on this information to generate the answer. We construct this dataset by leveraging an existing dataset of texts and their associated tables. For each such tables, we formulate new queries, and gather their respective answers. We demonstrate that all contemporary LLMs perform poorly on this dataset, achieving an accuracy below 38%. To pinpoint the difficulties and thoroughly dissect the problem, we analyze model performance across three components: table-generation, Pandas command-generation, and execution. Unexpectedly, we discover that each component presents substantial challenges for current LLMs. These insights lead us to propose a focused modeling framework, which we refer to as _IE as a tool_. Specifically, we propose to add ""tools"" for each of the above steps, and implement each such tool with few-shot prompting. This approach shows an improvement over existing prompting techniques, offering a promising direction for enhancing model capabilities in these tasks."
