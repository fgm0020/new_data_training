Poster,Wings: Learning Multimodal LLMs without Text-only Forgetting,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93663,"Yi-Kai Zhang, Shiyin Lu, Yang Li, YanQing Ma, Qingguo Chen, Zhao Xu, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang, De-Chuan Zhan, Han-Jia Ye","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), initiated with a trained LLM, first align images with text and then fine-tune on multimodal mixed inputs. However, during the continued training, the MLLM catastrophically forgets the text-only instructions that the initial LLM masters. In this paper, we present Wings, a novel MLLM that excels in both text-only and multimodal instructions. By examining attention across layers of MLLM, we find that *text-only forgetting* is related to the attention shifts from pre-image to post-image text. From that, we construct an additional Low-Rank Residual Attention (LoRRA) block that acts as the ""modality learner"" to expand the learnable space and compensate for the attention shift. The complementary learners, like ""wings"" on either side, are connected in parallel to each layer's attention block. The LoRRA mirrors the structure of attention but utilizes low-rank connections to ensure efficiency. Initially, image and text inputs are aligned with visual learners operating alongside the main attention, balancing focus on visual elements. Later, textual learners are integrated with token-wise routing, blending the outputs of both modality learners collaboratively. Our experimental results demonstrate that Wings outperforms equally-scaled MLLMs in both text-only and visual question-answering tasks. Wings with *compensation of learners* addresses text-only forgetting during visual modality expansion in general MLLMs."
Poster,WISE: Rethinking the Knowledge Memory for Lifelong Model Editing of Large Language Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94912,"Peng Wang, Zexi Li, Ningyu Zhang, Ziwen Xu, Yunzhi Yao, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Huajun Chen","Large language models (LLMs) need knowledge updates to meet the ever-growing world facts and correct the hallucinated responses, facilitating the methods of lifelong model editing. Where the updated knowledge resides in memories is a fundamental question for model editing. In this paper, we find that editing either long-term memory (direct model parameters) or working memory (non-parametric knowledge of neural network activations/representations by retrieval) will result in an impossible triangle---reliability, generalization, and locality can not be realized together in the lifelong editing settings. For long-term memory, directly editing the parameters will cause conflicts with irrelevant pretrained knowledge or previous edits (poor reliability and locality). For working memory, retrieval-based activations can hardly make the model understand the edits and generalize (poor generalization). Therefore, we propose WISE to bridge the gap between memories. In WISE, we design a dual parametric memory scheme, which consists of the main memory for the pretrained knowledge and a side memory for the edited knowledge. We only edit the knowledge in the side memory and train a router to decide which memory to go through when given a query. For continual editing, we devise a knowledge-sharding mechanism where different sets of edits reside in distinct subspaces of parameters, and are subsequently merged into a shared memory without conflicts. Extensive experiments show that WISE can outperform previous model editing methods and overcome the impossible triangle under lifelong model editing of question answering, hallucination, and out-of-distribution settings across trending LLM architectures, e.g., GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral."
Poster,WizardArena: Post-training Large Language Models via Simulated Offline Chatbot Arena,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94915,"HAIPENG LUO, Qingfeng Sun, Can Xu, Pu Zhao, Qingwei Lin, Jian-Guang Lou, Shifeng Chen, Yansong Tang, Weizhu Chen","Recent work demonstrates that, post-training large language models with open-domain instruction following data have achieved colossal success. Simultaneously, human Chatbot Arena has emerged as one of the most reasonable benchmarks for model evaluation and developmental guidance. However, the processes of manually curating high-quality training data and utilizing online human evaluation platforms are both expensive and limited. To mitigate the manual and temporal costs associated with post-training, this paper introduces a Simulated Chatbot Arena named WizardArena, which is fully based on and powered by open-source LLMs. For evaluation scenario, WizardArena can efficiently predict accurate performance rankings among different models based on offline test set. For training scenario, we simulate arena battles among various state-of-the-art models on a large scale of instruction data, subsequently leveraging the battle results to constantly enhance target model in both the supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning . Experimental results demonstrate that our WizardArena aligns closely with the online human arena rankings, and our models trained on offline extensive battle data exhibit significant performance improvements during SFT, DPO, and PPO stages."
Poster,WONDERBREAD: A Benchmark for Evaluating Multimodal Foundation Models on Business Process Management Tasks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97485,"Michael Wornow, Avanika Narayan, Ben Viggiano, Ishan Khare, Tathagat Verma, Tibor Thompson, Miguel Hernandez, Sudharsan Sundar, Chloe Trujillo, Krrish Chawla, Rongfei Lu, Justin Shen, Divya Nagaraj, Joshua Martinez, Vardhan Agrawal, Althea Hudson, Nigam Shah, Christopher Ré","Existing ML benchmarks lack the depth and diversity of annotations needed for evaluating models on business process management (BPM) tasks. BPM is the practice of documenting, measuring, improving, and automating enterprise workflows. However, research has focused almost exclusively on one task -- full end-to-end automation using agents based on multimodal foundation models (FMs) like GPT-4. This focus on automation ignores the reality of how most BPM tools are applied today -- simply documenting the relevant workflow takes 60% of the time of the typical process optimization project. To address this gap we present WONDERBREAD, the first benchmark for evaluating multimodal FMs on BPM tasks beyond automation. Our contributions are: (1) a dataset containing 2928 documented workflow demonstrations; (2) 6 novel BPM tasks sourced from real-world applications ranging from workflow documentation to knowledge transfer to process improvement; and (3) an automated evaluation harness. Our benchmark shows that while state-of-the-art FMs can automatically generate documentation (e.g. recalling 88% of the steps taken in a video demonstration of a workflow), they struggle to re-apply that knowledge towards finer-grained validation of workflow completion (F1 < 0.3). We hope WONDERBREAD encourages the development of more ""human-centered"" AI tooling for enterprise applications and furthers the exploration of multimodal FMs for the broader universe of BPM tasks. We publish our dataset and experiments here: https://github.com/HazyResearch/wonderbread"
Poster,WorkArena++: Towards Compositional Planning and Reasoning-based Common Knowledge Work Tasks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97713,"Léo Boisvert, Megh Thakkar, Maxime Gasse, Massimo Caccia, Thibault de Chezelles, Quentin Cappart, Nicolas Chapados, Alexandre Lacoste, Alexandre Drouin","The ability of large language models (LLMs) to mimic human-like intelligence has led to a surge in LLM-based autonomous agents. Though recent LLMs seem capable of planning and reasoning given user instructions, their effectiveness in applying these capabilities for autonomous task solving remains underexplored. This is especially true in enterprise settings, where automated agents hold the promise of a high impact. To fill this gap, we propose WorkArena++, a novel benchmark consisting of 682 tasks corresponding to realistic workflows routinely performed by knowledge workers. WorkArena++ is designed to evaluate the planning, problem-solving, logical/arithmetic reasoning, retrieval, and contextual understanding abilities of web agents. Our empirical studies across state-of-the-art LLMs and vision-language models (VLMs), as well as human workers, reveal several challenges for such models to serve as useful assistants in the workplace. In addition to the benchmark, we provide a mechanism to effortlessly generate thousands of ground-truth observation/action traces, which can be used for fine-tuning existing models. Overall, we expect this work to serve as a useful resource to help the community progress towards capable autonomous agents. The benchmark can be found at https://github.com/ServiceNow/WorkArena."
Poster,"WorldCoder, a Model-Based LLM Agent: Building World Models by Writing Code and Interacting with the Environment",https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95246,"Hao Tang, Darren Key, Kevin Ellis","We give a model-based agent that builds a Python program representing its knowledge of the world based on its interactions with the environment. The world model tries to explain its interactions, while also being optimistic about what reward it can achieve. We define this optimism as a logical constraint between a program and a planner. We study our agent on gridworlds, and on task planning, finding our approach is more sample-efficient compared to deep RL, more compute-efficient compared to ReAct-style agents, and that it can transfer its knowledge across environments by editing its code."
Poster,Wormhole Loss for Partial Shape Matching,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94143,"Amit Bracha, Thomas Dagès, Ron Kimmel","When matching parts of a surface to its whole, a fundamental question arises: Which points should be included in the matching process? The issue is intensified when using isometry to measure similarity, as it requires the validation of whether distances measured between pairs of surface points should influence the matching process. The approach we propose treats surfaces as manifolds equipped with geodesic distances, and addresses the partial shape matching challenge by introducing a novel criterion to meticulously search for consistent distances between pairs of points. The new criterion explores the relation between intrinsic geodesic distances between the points, geodesic distances between the points and surface boundaries, and extrinsic distances between boundary points measured in the embedding space. It is shown to be less restrictive compared to previous measures and achieves state-of-the-art results when used as a loss function in training networks for partial shape matching."
Poster,Worst-Case Offline Reinforcement Learning with Arbitrary Data Support,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96552,Kohei Miyaguchi,"We propose a method of offline reinforcement learning (RL) featuring the performance guarantee without any assumptions on the data support. Under such conditions, estimating or optimizing the conventional performance metric is generally infeasible due to the distributional discrepancy between data and target policy distributions. To address this issue, we employ a worst-case policy value as a new metric and constructively show that the sample complexity bound of $O(\epsilon^{−2})$ is attainable without any data-support conditions, where $\epsilon>0$ is the policy suboptimality in the new metric. Moreover, as the new metric generalizes the conventional one, the algorithm can address standard offline RL tasks without modification. In this context, our sample complexity bound can be seen as a strict improvement on the previous bounds under the single-policy concentrability and the single-policy realizability."
Poster,Would I Lie To You? Inference Time Alignment of Language Models using Direct Preference Heads,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95450,"Avelina Hadji-Kyriacou, Ognjen Arandjelovic","Pre-trained Language Models (LMs) exhibit strong zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities; however, their behaviors are often difficult to control. By utilizing Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), it is possible to fine-tune unsupervised LMs to follow instructions and produce outputs that reflect human preferences. Despite its benefits, RLHF has been shown to potentially harm a language model's reasoning capabilities and introduce artifacts such as hallucinations where the model may fabricate facts. To address this issue we introduce Direct Preference Heads (DPH), a fine-tuning framework that enables LMs to learn human preference signals through an auxiliary reward head without directly affecting the output distribution of the language modeling head. We perform a theoretical analysis of our objective function and find strong ties to Conservative Direct Preference Optimization (cDPO). Finally we evaluate our models on GLUE, RACE, and the GPT4All evaluation suite and demonstrate that our method produces models which achieve higher scores than those fine-tuned with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) alone."
Poster,XLand-MiniGrid: Scalable Meta-Reinforcement Learning Environments in JAX,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97425,"Alexander Nikulin, Vladislav Kurenkov, Ilya Zisman, Artem Agarkov, Viacheslav Sinii, Sergey Kolesnikov","Inspired by the diversity and depth of XLand and the simplicity and minimalism of MiniGrid, we present XLand-MiniGrid, a suite of tools and grid-world environments for meta-reinforcement learning research. Written in JAX, XLand-MiniGrid is designed to be highly scalable and can potentially run on GPU or TPU accelerators, democratizing large-scale experimentation with limited resources. Along with the environments, XLand-MiniGrid provides pre-sampled benchmarks with millions of unique tasks of varying difficulty and easy-to-use baselines that allow users to quickly start training adaptive agents. In addition, we have conducted a preliminary analysis of scaling and generalization, showing that our baselines are capable of reaching millions of steps per second during training and validating that the proposed benchmarks are challenging.
