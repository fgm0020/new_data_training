Poster,Large language model validity via enhanced conformal prediction methods,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95729,"John Cherian, Isaac Gibbs, Emmanuel Candes","We develop new conformal inference methods for obtaining validity guarantees on the output of large language models (LLMs). Prior work in conformal language modeling identifies a subset of the text that satisfies a high-probability guarantee of correctness. These methods work by filtering claims from the LLM's original response if a scoring function evaluated on the claim fails to exceed a threshold calibrated via split conformal prediction. Existing methods in this area suffer from two deficiencies. First, the guarantee stated is not conditionally valid. The trustworthiness of the filtering step may vary based on the topic of the response. Second, because the scoring function is imperfect, the filtering step can remove many valuable and accurate claims. We address both of these challenges via two new conformal methods. First, we generalize the conditional conformal procedure of Gibbs et al. (2023) in order to adaptively issue weaker guarantees when they are required to preserve the utility of the output. Second, we show how to systematically improve the quality of the scoring function via a novel algorithm for differentiating through the conditional conformal procedure. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on biography and medical question-answering datasets."
Poster,Large Pre-trained time series models for cross-domain Time series analysis tasks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93205,"Harshavardhan Prabhakar Kamarthi, B. Aditya Prakash","Large pre-trained models have been vital in recent advancements in domains like language and vision, making model training for individual downstream tasks more efficient and provide superior performance. However, tackling time-series analysis tasks usually involves designing and training a separate model from scratch leveraging training data and domain expertise specific to the task. We tackle a significant challenge for pre-training a foundational time-series model from multi-domain time-series datasets: extracting semantically useful tokenized inputs to the model across heterogeneous time-series from different domains. We propose Large Pre-trained Time-series Models (LPTM) that introduces a novel method of adaptive segmentation that automatically identifies optimal dataset-specific segmentation strategy during pre-training. This enables LPTM to perform similar to or better than domain-specific state-of-art model when fine-tuned to different downstream time-series analysis tasks and under zero-shot settings. LPTM achieves superior forecasting and time-series classification results taking up to 40% less data and 50% less training time compared to state-of-art baselines."
Poster,Large Scale Transfer Learning for Tabular Data  via Language Modeling,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94842,"Josh Gardner, Juan Perdomo, Ludwig Schmidt","Tabular data – structured, heterogeneous, spreadsheet-style data with rows and columns – is widely used in practice across many domains. However, while recent foundation models have reduced the need for developing task-specific datasets and predictors in domains such as language modeling and computer vision, this transfer learning paradigm has not had similar impact in the tabular domain. In this work, we seek to narrow this gap and present TABULA-8B, a language model for tabular prediction. We define a process for extracting a large, high-quality training dataset from the TabLib corpus, proposing methods for tabular data filtering and quality control. Using the resulting dataset, which comprises over 2.1B rows from 4.2M unique tables, we fine-tune a Llama 3-8B large language model (LLM) for tabular data prediction (classification and binned regression) using a novel packing and attention scheme for tabular prediction. Through evaluation across a test suite of 329 datasets, we find that TABULA-8B has zero-shot accuracy on unseen tables that is over 15 percentage points (pp) higher than random guessing, a feat that is not possible with existing state-of-the-art tabular prediction models (e.g. XGBoost, TabPFN). In the few-shot setting (1-32 shots), without any fine-tuning on the target datasets, TABULA-8B is 5-15 pp more accurate than XGBoost and TabPFN models that are explicitly trained on equal, or even up to 16× more data. We release our model, code, and data along with the publication of this paper."
Poster,Large Spatial Model: End-to-end Unposed Images to Semantic 3D,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93007,"Zhiwen Fan, Jian Zhang, Wenyan Cong, Peihao Wang, Renjie Li, Kairun Wen, Shijie Zhou, Achuta Kadambi, Zhangyang &quot;Atlas&quot; Wang, Danfei Xu, Boris Ivanovic, Marco Pavone, Yue Wang","Reconstructing and understanding 3D structures from a limited number of images is a classical problem in computer vision. Traditional approaches typically decompose this task into multiple subtasks, involving several stages of complex mappings between different data representations. For example, dense reconstruction using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) requires transforming images into key points, optimizing camera parameters, and estimating structures. Following this, accurate sparse reconstructions are necessary for further dense modeling, which is then input into task-specific neural networks. This multi-stage paradigm leads to significant processing times and engineering complexity.In this work, we introduce the Large Spatial Model (LSM), which directly processes unposed RGB images into semantic radiance fields. LSM simultaneously estimates geometry, appearance, and semantics in a single feed-forward pass and can synthesize versatile label maps by interacting through language at novel views. Built on a general Transformer-based framework, LSM predicts global geometry via pixel-aligned point maps. To improve spatial attribute regression, we adopt local context aggregation with multi-scale fusion, enhancing the accuracy of fine local details. To address the scarcity of labeled 3D semantic data and enable natural language-driven scene manipulation, we incorporate a pre-trained 2D language-based segmentation model into a 3D-consistent semantic feature field. An efficient decoder parameterizes a set of semantic anisotropic Gaussians, allowing supervised end-to-end learning. Comprehensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate that LSM unifies multiple 3D vision tasks directly from unposed images, achieving real-time semantic 3D reconstruction for the first time."
Poster,Large Stepsize Gradient Descent for Non-Homogeneous Two-Layer Networks: Margin Improvement and Fast Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94399,"Yuhang Cai, Jingfeng Wu, Song Mei, Michael Lindsey, Peter Bartlett","The typical training of neural networks using large stepsize gradient descent (GD) under the logistic loss often involves two distinct phases, where the empirical risk oscillates in the first phase but decreases monotonically in the second phase. We investigate this phenomenon in two-layer networks that satisfy a near-homogeneity condition. We show that the second phase begins once the empirical risk falls below a certain threshold, dependent on the stepsize. Additionally, we show that the normalized margin grows nearly monotonically in the second phase, demonstrating an implicit bias of GD in training non-homogeneous predictors. If the dataset is linearly separable and the derivative of the activation function is bounded away from zero, we show that the average empirical risk decreases, implying that the first phase must stop in finite steps. Finally, we demonstrate that by choosing a suitably large stepsize, GD that undergoes this phase transition is more efficient than GD that monotonically decreases the risk. Our analysis applies to networks of any width, beyond the well-known neural tangent kernel and mean-field regimes."
Poster,LaSCal: Label-Shift Calibration without target labels,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95049,"Teodora Popordanoska, Gorjan Radevski, Tinne Tuytelaars, Matthew Blaschko","When machine learning systems face dataset shift, model calibration plays a pivotal role in ensuring their reliability.Calibration error (CE) provides insights into the alignment between the predicted confidence scores and the classifier accuracy.While prior works have delved into the implications of dataset shift on calibration, existing CE estimators either (i) assume access to labeled data from the target domain, often unavailable in practice, or (ii) are derived under a covariate shift assumption.In this work we propose a novel, label-free, consistent CE estimator under label shift. Label shift is characterized by changes in the marginal label distribution p(Y), with a constant conditional p(X|Y) distribution between the source and target. We introduce a novel calibration method, called LaSCal, which uses the estimator in conjunction with a post-hoc calibration strategy, to perform unsupervised calibration on the target distribution. Our thorough empirical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed approach across different modalities, model architectures and label shift intensities."
Poster,LaSe-E2V: Towards Language-guided Semantic-aware Event-to-Video Reconstruction,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96723,"Kanghao Chen, Hangyu Li, Jiazhou Zhou, Zeyu Wang, Lin Wang","Event cameras harness advantages such as low latency, high temporal resolution, and high dynamic range (HDR), compared to standard cameras. Due to the distinct imaging paradigm shift, a dominant line of research focuses on event-to-video (E2V) reconstruction to bridge event-based and standard computer vision. However, this task remains challenging due to its inherently ill-posed nature: event cameras only detect the edge and motion information locally. Consequently, the reconstructed videos are often plagued by artifacts and regional blur, primarily caused by the ambiguous semantics of event data. In this paper, we find language naturally conveys abundant semantic information, rendering it stunningly superior in ensuring semantic consistency for E2V reconstruction. Accordingly, we propose a novel framework, called LaSe-E2V,  that can achieve semantic-aware high-quality E2V reconstruction from a language-guided perspective, buttressed by the text-conditional diffusion models. However, due to diffusion models' inherent diversity and randomness, it is hardly possible to directly apply them to achieve spatial and temporal consistency for E2V reconstruction. Thus, we first propose an Event-guided Spatiotemporal Attention (ESA) module to condition the event data to the denoising pipeline effectively. We then introduce an event-aware mask loss to ensure temporal coherence and a noise initialization strategy to enhance spatial consistency. Given the absence of event-text-video paired data, we aggregate existing E2V datasets and generate textual descriptions using the tagging models for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments on three datasets covering diverse challenging scenarios (e.g., fast motion, low light) demonstrate the superiority of our method. Demo videos for the results are attached to the project page."
Poster,Last-Iterate Convergence for Generalized Frank-Wolfe in Monotone Variational Inequalities,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96016,"Zaiwei Chen, Eric Mazumdar","We study the convergence behavior of a generalized Frank-Wolfe algorithm in constrained (stochastic) monotone variational inequality (MVI) problems. In recent years, there have been numerous efforts to design algorithms for solving constrained MVI problems due to their connections with optimization, machine learning, and equilibrium computation in games. Most work in this domain has focused on extensions of simultaneous gradient play, with particular emphasis on understanding the convergence properties of extragradient and optimistic gradient methods. In contrast, we examine the performance of an algorithm from another well-known class of optimization algorithms: Frank-Wolfe. We show that a generalized variant of this algorithm achieves a fast $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2})$ last-iterate convergence rate in constrained MVI problems. By drawing connections between our generalized Frank-Wolfe algorithm and the well-known smoothed fictitious play (FP) from game theory, we also derive a finite-sample convergence rate for smoothed FP in zero-sum matrix games. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a stochastic variant of the generalized Frank-Wolfe algorithm for MVI problems also converges in a last-iterate sense, albeit at a slower $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/6})$ convergence rate."
Poster,Last-Iterate Global Convergence of Policy Gradients for Constrained Reinforcement Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96786,"Alessandro Montenegro, Marco Mussi, Matteo Papini, Alberto Maria Metelli","*Constrained Reinforcement Learning* (CRL) tackles sequential decision-making problems where agents are required to achieve goals by maximizing the expected return while meeting domain-specific constraints, which are often formulated on expected costs. In this setting, *policy-based* methods are widely used since they come with several advantages when dealing with continuous-control problems. These methods search in the policy space with an *action-based* or *parameter-based* exploration strategy, depending on whether they learn directly the parameters of a stochastic policy or those of a stochastic hyperpolicy. In this paper, we propose a general framework for addressing CRL problems via *gradient-based primal-dual* algorithms, relying on an alternate ascent/descent scheme with dual-variable regularization. We introduce an exploration-agnostic algorithm, called C-PG, which exhibits global last-iterate convergence guarantees under (weak) gradient domination assumptions, improving and generalizing existing results. Then, we design C-PGAE and C-PGPE, the action-based and the parameter-based versions of C-PG, respectively, and we illustrate how they naturally extend to constraints defined in terms of *risk measures* over the costs, as it is often requested in safety-critical scenarios. Finally, we numerically validate our algorithms on constrained control problems, and compare them with state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating their effectiveness."
Poster,Latent Diffusion for Neural Spiking Data,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94632,"Jaivardhan Kapoor, Auguste Schulz, Julius Vetter, Felix Pei, Richard Gao, Jakob H Macke","Modern datasets in neuroscience enable unprecedented inquiries into the relationship between complex behaviors and the activity of many simultaneously recorded neurons. While latent variable models can successfully extract low-dimensional embeddings from such recordings, using them to generate realistic spiking data, especially in a behavior-dependent manner, still poses a challenge. Here, we present Latent Diffusion for Neural Spiking data (LDNS), a diffusion-based generative model with a low-dimensional latent space: LDNS employs an autoencoder with structured state-space (S4) layers to project discrete high-dimensional spiking data into continuous time-aligned latents. On these inferred latents, we train expressive (conditional) diffusion models, enabling us to sample neural activity with realistic single-neuron and population spiking statistics. We validate LDNS on synthetic data, accurately recovering latent structure, firing rates, and spiking statistics. Next, we demonstrate its flexibility by generating variable-length data that mimics human cortical activity during attempted speech. We show how to equip LDNS with an expressive observation model that accounts for single-neuron dynamics not mediated by the latent state, further increasing the realism of generated samples. Finally, conditional LDNS trained on motor cortical activity during diverse reaching behaviors can generate realistic spiking data given reach direction or unseen reach trajectories. In summary, LDNS simultaneously enables inference of low-dimensional latents and realistic conditional generation of neural spiking datasets, opening up further possibilities for simulating experimentally testable hypotheses."
