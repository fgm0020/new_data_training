Poster,DTGB: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Dynamic Text-Attributed Graphs,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/97873,"Jiasheng Zhang, Jialin Chen, Menglin Yang, Aosong Feng, Shuang Liang, Jie Shao, Rex Ying","Dynamic text-attributed graphs (DyTAGs) are prevalent in various real-world scenarios, where each node and edge are associated with text descriptions, and both the graph structure and text descriptions evolve over time. Despite their broad applicability, there is a notable scarcity of benchmark datasets tailored to DyTAGs, which hinders the potential advancement in many research fields. To address this gap, we introduce Dynamic Text-attributed Graph Benchmark (DTGB), a collection of large-scale, time-evolving graphs from diverse domains, with nodes and edges enriched by dynamically changing text attributes and categories. To facilitate the use of DTGB, we design standardized evaluation procedures based on four real-world use cases: future link prediction, destination node retrieval, edge classification, and textual relation generation. These tasks require models to understand both dynamic graph structures and natural language, highlighting the unique challenges posed by DyTAGs. Moreover, we conduct extensive benchmark experiments on DTGB, evaluating 7 popular dynamic graph learning algorithms and their variants of adapting to text attributes with LLM embeddings, along with 6 powerful large language models (LLMs). Our results show the limitations of existing models in handling DyTAGs. Our analysis also demonstrates the utility of DTGB in investigating the incorporation of structural and textual dynamics. The proposed DTGB fosters research on DyTAGs and their broad applications. It offers a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating and advancing models to handle the interplay between dynamic graph structures and natural language.

Poster,Dual Cone Gradient Descent for Training Physics-Informed Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94109,"Youngsik Hwang, Dongyoung Lim","Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a prominent approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by minimizing a combined loss function that incorporates both boundary loss and PDE residual loss. Despite their remarkable empirical performance in various scientific computing tasks, PINNs often fail to generate reasonable solutions, and such pathological behaviors remain difficult to explain and resolve. In this paper, we identify that PINNs can be adversely trained when gradients of each loss function exhibit a significant imbalance in their magnitudes and present a negative inner product value. To address these issues, we propose a novel optimization framework, *Dual Cone Gradient Descent* (DCGD), which adjusts the direction of the updated gradient to ensure it falls within a dual cone region. This region is defined as a set of vectors where the inner products with both the gradients of the PDE residual loss and the boundary loss are non-negative. Theoretically, we analyze the convergence properties of DCGD algorithms in a non-convex setting. On a variety of benchmark equations, we demonstrate that DCGD outperforms other optimization algorithms in terms of various evaluation metrics. In particular, DCGD achieves superior predictive accuracy and enhances the stability of training for failure modes of PINNs and complex PDEs, compared to existing optimally tuned models. Moreover, DCGD can be further improved by combining it with popular strategies for PINNs, including learning rate annealing and the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)."
Poster,Dual Critic Reinforcement Learning under Partial Observability,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95869,"Jinqiu Li, Enmin Zhao, Tong Wei, Junliang Xing, SHIMING XIANG","Partial observability in environments poses significant challenges that impede the formation of effective policies in reinforcement learning. Prior research has shown that borrowing the complete state information can enhance sample efficiency. This strategy, however, frequently encounters unstable learning with high variance in practical applications due to the over-reliance on complete information. This paper introduces DCRL, a Dual Critic Reinforcement Learning framework designed to adaptively harness full-state information during training to reduce variance for optimized online performance. In particular, DCRL incorporates two distinct critics: an oracle critic with access to complete state information and a standard critic functioning within the partially observable context. It innovates a synergistic strategy to meld the strengths of the oracle critic for efficiency improvement and the standard critic for variance reduction, featuring a novel mechanism for seamless transition and weighting between them. We theoretically prove that DCRL mitigates the learning variance while maintaining unbiasedness. Extensive experimental analyses across the Box2D and Box3D environments have verified DCRL's superior performance. The source code is available in the supplementary."
Poster,Dual Defense: Enhancing Privacy and Mitigating Poisoning Attacks in Federated Learning,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/96030,"Runhua Xu, Shiqi Gao, Chao Li, James Joshi, Jianxin Li","Federated learning (FL) is inherently susceptible to privacy breaches and poisoning attacks. To tackle these challenges, researchers have separately devised secure aggregation mechanisms to protect data privacy and robust aggregation methods that withstand poisoning attacks. However, simultaneously addressing both concerns is challenging; secure aggregation facilitates poisoning attacks as most anomaly detection techniques require access to unencrypted local model updates, which are obscured by secure aggregation. Few recent efforts to simultaneously tackle both challenges offen depend on impractical assumption of non-colluding two-server setups that disrupt FL's topology, or three-party computation which introduces scalability issues, complicating deployment and application. To overcome this dilemma, this paper introduce a Dual Defense Federated learning (DDFed) framework. DDFed simultaneously boosts privacy protection and mitigates poisoning attacks, without introducing new participant roles or disrupting the existing FL topology. DDFed initially leverages cutting-edge fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to securely aggregate model updates, without the impractical requirement for non-colluding two-server setups and ensures strong privacy protection. Additionally, we proposes a unique two-phase anomaly detection mechanism for encrypted model updates, featuring secure similarity computation and feedback-driven collaborative selection, with additional measures to prevent potential privacy breaches from Byzantine clients incorporated into the detection process. We conducted extensive experiments on various model poisoning attacks and FL scenarios, including both cross-device and cross-silo FL. Experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that DDFed successfully protects model privacy and effectively defends against model poisoning threats."
Poster,Dual-Diffusion for Binocular 3D Human Pose Estimation,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95437,"Xiaoyue Wan, Zhuo Chen, Bingzhi Duan, Xu Zhao","Binocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE), reconstructing a 3D pose from 2D poses of two views, offers practical advantages by combining multiview geometry with the convenience of a monocular setup. However, compared to a multiview setup, the reduction in the number of cameras increases uncertainty in 3D reconstruction. To address this issue, we leverage the diffusion model, which has shown success in monocular 3D HPE by recovering 3D poses from noisy data with high uncertainty. Yet, the uncertainty distribution of initial 3D poses remains unknown. Considering that 3D errors stem from 2D errors within geometric constraints, we recognize that the uncertainties of 3D and 2D are integrated in a binocular configuration, with the initial 2D uncertainty being well-defined. Based on this insight, we propose Dual-Diffusion specifically for Binocular 3D HPE, simultaneously denoising the uncertainties in 2D and 3D, and recovering plausible and accurate results. Additionally, we introduce Z-embedding as an additional condition for denoising and implement baseline-width-related pose normalization to enhance the model flexibility for various baseline settings. This is crucial as 3D error influence factors encompass depth and baseline width. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our Dual-Diffusion in 2D refinement and 3D estimation.

Poster,Dual Encoder GAN Inversion for High-Fidelity 3D Head Reconstruction from Single Images,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95080,"Bahri Batuhan Bilecen, Ahmet Gökmen, Aysegul Dundar","3D GAN inversion aims to project a single image into the latent space of a 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), thereby achieving 3D geometry reconstruction. While there exist encoders that achieve good results in 3D GAN inversion, they are predominantly built on EG3D, which specializes in synthesizing near-frontal views and is limiting in synthesizing comprehensive 3D scenes from diverse viewpoints. In contrast to existing approaches, we propose a novel framework built on PanoHead, which excels in synthesizing images from a 360-degree perspective. To achieve realistic 3D modeling of the input image, we introduce a dual encoder system tailored for high-fidelity reconstruction and realistic generation from different viewpoints. Accompanying this, we propose a stitching framework on the triplane domain to get the best predictions from both. To achieve seamless stitching, both encoders must output consistent results despite being specialized for different tasks. For this reason, we carefully train these encoders using specialized losses, including an adversarial loss based on our novel occlusion-aware triplane discriminator. Experiments reveal that our approach surpasses the existing encoder training methods qualitatively and quantitatively."
Poster,Dual-frame Fluid Motion Estimation with Test-time Optimization and Zero-divergence Loss,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94835,"Yifei Zhang, Huan-ang Gao, zhou jiang, Hao Zhao","3D particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) is a key technique for analyzing turbulent flow, one of the most challenging computational problems of our century. At the core of 3D PTV is the dual-frame fluid motion estimation algorithm, which tracks particles across two consecutive frames. Recently, deep learning-based methods have achieved impressive accuracy in dual-frame fluid motion estimation; however, they heavily depend on large volumes of labeled data. In this paper, we introduce a new method that is **completely self-supervised and notably outperforms its fully-supervised counterparts while requiring only 1\% of the training samples (without labels) used by previous methods.** Our method features a novel zero-divergence loss that is specific to the domain of turbulent flow. Inspired by the success of splat operation in high-dimensional filtering and random fields, we propose a splat-based implementation for this loss which is both efficient and effective. The self-supervised nature of our method naturally supports test-time optimization, leading to the development of a tailored Dynamic Velocimetry Enhancer (DVE) module. We demonstrate that strong cross-domain robustness is achieved through test-time optimization on unseen leave-one-out synthetic domains and real physical/biological domains.

Poster,Dual Lagrangian Learning for Conic Optimization,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/94146,"Mathieu Tanneau, Pascal Van Hentenryck","This paper presents Dual Lagrangian Learning (DLL), a principled learning methodology for dual conic optimization proxies.DLL leverages conic duality and the representation power of ML models to provide high-duality, dual-feasible solutions, and therefore valid Lagrangian dual bounds, for linear and nonlinear conic optimization problems.The paper introduces a systematic dual completion procedure, differentiable conic projection layers, and a self-supervised learning framework based on Lagrangian duality.It also provides closed-form dual completion formulae for broad classes of conic problems, which eliminate the need for costly implicit layers.The effectiveness of DLL is demonstrated on linear and nonlinear conic optimization problems.The proposed methodology significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art learning-based method, and achieves 1000x speedups over commercial interior-point solvers with optimality gaps under 0.5\% on average."
Poster,Dual-Personalizing Adapter for Federated Foundation Models,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/93668,"yiyuan yang, Guodong Long, Tao Shen, Jing Jiang, Michael Blumenstein","Recently, foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated an impressive ability to adapt to various tasks by fine-tuning diverse instruction data. Notably, federated foundation models (FedFM) emerge as a privacy preservation method to fine-tune models collaboratively under federated learning (FL) settings by leveraging many distributed datasets with non-IID data. To alleviate communication and computation overhead, parameter-efficient methods are introduced for efficiency, and some research adapted personalization methods to FedFM for better user preferences alignment. However, a critical gap in existing research is the neglect of test-time distribution shifts in real-world applications, and conventional methods for test-time distribution shifts in personalized FL are less effective for FedFM due to their failure to adapt to complex distribution shift scenarios and the requirement to train all parameters. To bridge this gap, we refine the setting in FedFM, termed test-time personalization, which aims to learn personalized federated foundation models on clients while effectively handling test-time distribution shifts simultaneously. To address challenges in this setting, we explore a simple yet effective solution, a Federated Dual-Personalizing Adapter (FedDPA) architecture. By co-working with a foundation model, a global adapter and a local adapter jointly tackle the test-time distribution shifts and client-specific personalization. Additionally, we introduce an instance-wise dynamic weighting mechanism that dynamically integrates the global and local adapters for each test instance during inference, facilitating effective test-time personalization. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been evaluated on benchmark datasets across different NLP tasks."
Poster,Dual-Perspective Activation: Efficient Channel Denoising via Joint Forward-Backward Criterion for Artificial Neural Networks,https://neurips.cc//virtual/2024/poster/95636,"Tian Qiu, Chenchao Gao, Zunlei Feng, Jie Lei, Bingde Hu, Xingen Wang, Yi Gao, Mingli Song","The design of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is inspired by the working patterns of the human brain. Connections in biological neural networks are sparse, as they only exist between few neurons. Meanwhile, the sparse representation in ANNs has been shown to possess significant advantages. Activation responses of ANNs are typically expected to promote sparse representations, where key signals get activated while irrelevant/redundant signals are suppressed. It can be observed that samples of each category are only correlated with sparse and specific channels in ANNs. However, existing activation mechanisms often struggle to suppress signals from other irrelevant channels entirely, and these signals have been verified to be detrimental to the network's final decision. To address the issue of channel noise interference in ANNs, a novel end-to-end trainable Dual-Perspective Activation (DPA) mechanism is proposed. DPA efficiently identifies irrelevant channels and applies channel denoising under the guidance of a joint criterion established online from both forward and backward propagation perspectives while preserving activation responses from relevant channels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DPA successfully denoises channels and facilitates sparser neural representations. Moreover, DPA is parameter-free, fast, applicable to many mainstream ANN architectures, and achieves remarkable performance compared to other existing activation counterparts across multiple tasks and domains.
